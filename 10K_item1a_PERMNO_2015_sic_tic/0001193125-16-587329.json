RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment in our common stock. The risks described below are not the only ones we face in our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed. In such an event, our common stock could decline in price and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nOur results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, and competitors\u2019 pricing strategies, which can adversely affect our sales, margins, and net income.\nOur results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions, but also by local market conditions, and competitors\u2019 pricing strategies, which can vary substantially by market. Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market and may prompt promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins, constrain our operating flexibility or result in charges. Certain macroeconomic events, such as the past crisis in the financial markets, could have a more wide-ranging and prolonged impact on the general business environment, which could also adversely affect us. Whether we can manage these risks effectively depends mainly on the following:\n\u2022\nOur ability to manage movements in commodity prices and the impact of government actions to manage national economic conditions such as consumer spending, inflation rates and unemployment levels, particularly given the current volatility in the global financial markets; and\n\u2022\nThe impact on our margins of labor costs given our labor-intensive business model, the trend toward higher wages in both mature and developing markets and the potential impact of union organizing efforts on day-to-day operations of our manufacturing facilities.\nDeclining economic conditions could negatively impact our business.\nOur operations are affected by local, national and worldwide economic conditions. The consequences of domestic and international economic uncertainty or instability, volatility in commodity markets, and domestic or international policy uncertainty, all of which we have seen, can all impact economic activity. This in turn can impact the demand for our products. Instability in the financial markets also may affect our cost of capital and our ability to raise capital, if needed.\nThe terms and conditions of our credit facility impose certain restrictions on our operations. We may not be able to raise additional capital, if needed, for proposed expansion projects.\nThe terms and conditions of our credit facility impose certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, make capital expenditures, acquisitions and asset dispositions, as well as imposing other customary covenants, such as requiring a tangible equity level and a ratio of total funded debt to the sum of net earnings plus interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d). Our ability to comply with the covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, such as distressed and volatile financial and/or consumer markets, etc. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facility. In the event of a default, the bank could elect to declare\nthe outstanding principal amount of our credit facility, all interest thereon, and all other amounts payable under our credit facility to be immediately due and payable. As of February 29, 2016, we were in compliance with all terms and conditions of our credit facility, which matures on August 18, 2016. During the period we received a binding commitment from our primary lender to extend the maturity date on the above Facility to August 19, 2017 for an amount in excess of the amount outstanding under the same terms and conditions.\nDeclining financial market conditions and continued decline in long-term interest rates could adversely impact the funded status of our pension plan.\nWe maintain a noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan (the \u201cPension Plan\u201d) covering approximately 8% of our employees. Included in our financial results are Pension Plan costs that are measured using actuarial valuations. The actuarial assumptions used may differ from actual results. In addition, as our Pension Plan assets are invested in marketable securities, severe fluctuations in market values could potentially negatively impact our funded status, recorded pension liability, and future required minimum contribution levels. In addition, a decline in long-term debt interest rates puts downward pressure on the discount rate used by plan sponsors to determine their pension liabilities. Each 10 basis point change in the discount rate impacts our computed liability by about $900,000. Similar to fluctuations in market values, a drop in the discount rate could potentially negatively impact our funded status, recorded pension liability and future contribution levels. In addition, continued changes in the mortality tables could potentially impact our funded status. The adoption of 2014 actuarial mortality tables in fiscal year 2015 had a negative impact on our funding status; however, the adoption of the new MR-2015 mortality improvement scale in fiscal year 2016 had a positive impact by reducing our recorded liabilities by $1.6 million.\nIn 2015 and 2016 we wrote down Apparel Segment goodwill and other intangible assets and we may have similar charges in the future, which could cause our financial condition and results of operations to be negatively affected in the future.\nWhen we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition may be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The amount of the purchase price which is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable tangible assets acquired. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. An impairment may be caused by any number of factors outside our control, such as a decline in market conditions caused by a recession, or protracted recovery there-from, or other factors like competitor\u2019s pricing strategies, which may be tied to such economic events. We have recorded an impairment charge during the current fiscal year due to the carrying value of our intangible assets and several impairment charges in years past relating to goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our Apparel Segment. Continued sale-side pressure due to competitor\u2019s pricing strategies or continued challenging market conditions could result in an impairment charge in the future. Though to date, we have not been required to take an impairment charge related to our Print Segment, continued sale-side pressures due to technology transference, competitor pricing pressures, and economic uncertainties could result in a determination that a portion of the recorded value of goodwill and intangible assets may be required to be written down. Although such a charge would be a non-cash expense, it would impact our reported operating results and financial position. At February 29, 2016, our consolidated goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $64.5 million and $66.9 million, respectively, of which $14.7 million of other intangibles related to our Apparel Segment.\nDigital technologies will continue to erode the demand for our printed business documents.\nThe increasing sophistication of software, internet technologies, and digital equipment combined with our customers\u2019 general preference, as well as governmental influences for paperless business environments will continue to reduce the number of traditional printed documents sold. Moreover, the documents that will continue to coexist with software applications will likely contain less value-added print content.\nMany of our custom-printed documents help companies control their internal business processes and facilitate the flow of information. These applications will increasingly be conducted over the internet or through other electronic payment systems. The predominant method of our customers\u2019 communication to their customers is by printed information. As their customers become more accepting of internet communications, our clients may increasingly opt for what is perceived to be less costly electronic option, which would reduce our revenue. The pace of these trends is\ndifficult to predict. These factors will tend to reduce the industry-wide demand for printed documents and require us to gain market share to maintain or increase our current level of print-based revenue.\nIn response to the gradual obsolescence of our standardized forms business, we continue to develop our capability to provide custom and full-color products. If new printing capabilities and new product introductions do not continue to offset the obsolescence of our standardized business forms products, and we aren\u2019t able to increase our market share, our sales and profits will be affected. Decreases in sales of our standardized business forms and products due to obsolescence could also reduce our gross margins or impact the value of our recorded goodwill and intangible assets. This reduction could in turn adversely impact our profits, unless we are able to offset the reduction through the introduction of new high margin products and services or realize cost savings in other areas.\nOur distributor customers may be acquired by other manufacturers who redirect business within their plants.\nSome of our customers are being absorbed by the distribution channels of some of our manufacturing competitors. However, we do not believe this will significantly impact our business model. We have continued to sell to some of these customers even after they were absorbed by our competition because of the breadth of our product line and our geographic diversity.\nOur distributors face increased competition from various sources, such as office supply superstores. Increased competition may require us to reduce prices or to offer other incentives in order to enable our distributors to attract new customers and retain existing customers.\nLow price, high value office supply chain stores offer standardized business forms, checks and related products. Because of their size, these superstores have the buying power to offer many of these products at competitive prices. These superstores also offer the convenience of \u201cone-stop\u201d shopping for a broad array of office supplies that our distributors do not offer. In addition, superstores have the financial strength to reduce prices or increase promotional discounts to expand market share. This could result in us reducing our prices or offering incentives in order to enable our distributors to attract new customers and retain existing customers, which could reduce our profits.\nTechnological improvements may reduce our competitive advantage over some of our competitors, which could reduce our profits.\nImprovements in the cost and quality of printing technology are enabling some of our competitors to gain access to products of complex design and functionality at competitive costs. Increased competition from these competitors could force us to reduce our prices in order to attract and retain customers, which could reduce our profits.\nWe could experience labor disputes that could disrupt our business in the future.\nAs of February 29, 2016, approximately 11% of our domestic employees are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements, which are subject to periodic negotiations. Two unions represent all of our hourly employees in Mexico. While we feel we have a good working relationship with all of the unions, there can be no assurance that any future labor negotiations will prove successful, which may result in a significant increase in the cost of labor, or may break down and result in the disruption of our business or operations.\nWe obtain our raw materials from a limited number of suppliers, and any disruption in our relationships with these suppliers, or any substantial increase in the price of raw materials or material shortages could have a material adverse effect on us.\nCotton yarn is the primary raw material used in Alstyle\u2019s manufacturing processes and represents a significant portion of its manufacturing costs. Alstyle acquires its yarn from three major sources that meet stringent quality and on-time delivery requirements. The largest supplier provided 43% of Alstyle\u2019s yarn requirements during fiscal year 2016 and has an entire yarn mill dedicated to Alstyle\u2019s production. To maintain our high standard of color control associated with our apparel products, we purchase our dyeing chemicals from limited sources. If Alstyle\u2019s relations with its suppliers are disrupted, Alstyle may not be able to enter into arrangements with substitute suppliers on terms as favorable as its current terms, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe also purchase our paper products from a limited number of sources, which meet stringent quality and on-time delivery standards under long-term contracts. However, fluctuations in the quality of our paper, unexpected price increases or other factors that relate to our paper products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nBoth cotton and paper are commodities that are subject to periodic increases or decreases in price, which are sometimes quite significant. There is no effective market of derivative instruments to cost-effectively insulate us against unexpected changes in price of paper, and corporate negotiated purchase contracts provide only limited protection against price increases. We generally acquire our cotton yarn under short-term purchase contracts with our suppliers. While we generally do not use derivative instruments, including cotton option contracts, to manage our exposure to movements in cotton market prices, we believe we are competitive with other companies in the United States apparel industry in negotiating the price of cotton. Generally, when cotton or paper prices are increased, we attempt to recover the higher costs by raising the prices of our products to our customers. In the price-competitive marketplaces in which we operate, we may not always be able to pass through any or all of the higher costs. As such, any significant increase in the price of paper or cotton or shortages in the availability of either, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe face intense competition to gain market share, which may lead some competitors to sell substantial amounts of goods at prices against which we cannot profitably compete.\nDemand for Alstyle\u2019s products is dependent on the general demand for shirts and the availability of alternative sources of supply. While Alstyle will compete on price, its marketing strategy is to differentiate itself by providing quality service and quality products to its customers. Even if this strategy is successful, its results may be offset by reductions in demand or price declines due to competitors\u2019 pricing strategies or other micro or macro-economic factors. Our Print Segment also faces the risk of our competition following a strategy of selling its products at or below cost in order to cover some amount of fixed costs, especially in distressed economic times.\nThe apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles.\nThe apparel industry is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of discretionary consumer spending, which changes as regional, domestic and international economic conditions change. These include, but are not limited to, employment levels, energy costs, interest rates, tax rates, personal debt levels, and uncertainty about the future. Any deterioration in general economic conditions that creates uncertainty or alters discretionary consumer spending habits could reduce our sales, increase our costs of goods sold or require us to significantly modify our current business practices, and consequently negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur foreign-based apparel manufacturing operations could be subject to unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other market barriers, political and economic instability, social unrest, as well as disruption of services in the countries where it operates, which could negatively impact our operating results.\nAlstyle operates manufacturing facilities in Mexico and from time to time sources product manufacturing and purchases from China, Pakistan, Central America and other foreign sources. Alstyle\u2019s foreign operations could be subject to unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs, and other market barriers, political and economic instability, social unrest in the countries where it operates, as well as utility and other service disruption. The impact of any such events that may occur in the future could subject Alstyle to additional costs or loss of sales, which could adversely affect our operating results. In particular, Alstyle operates its facilities in Mexico pursuant to the \u201cmaquiladora\u201d duty-free program established by the Mexican and United States governments. This program enables Alstyle to take advantage of generally lower costs in Mexico, without paying duty on inventory shipped into or out of Mexico. There can be no assurance that the governments of Mexico and the United States will continue the program currently in place or that Alstyle will continue to be able to benefit from this program. The loss of these benefits could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, all Alstyle\u2019s knit and dye operations are located in one facility in Agua Prieta, Mexico. Any disruptions in utility or other services required to continue operations that are caused by any of the above factors, as well as others, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operational results.\nOur apparel products are subject to foreign competition, which had been subject to U.S. government domestic quota restrictions or import duties in the past.\nForeign producers of apparel often have significant labor cost advantages. In the past few years, domestic quota restrictions have been eliminated for basically all foreign countries, which has significantly impacted domestic apparel producers. What remains in place today for these countries is import duties, which tends to offset some of the significant labor cost advantages these countries have over domestic and NAFTA/CAFTA producers. Import protection afforded to domestic apparel producers has been, and is likely to remain, subject to considerable political considerations. Given the number of these foreign producers, any further elimination of import protections that protect domestic apparel producers could materially adversely affect Alstyle\u2019s business.\nThe North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d) became effective on January 1, 1994 and has created a free-trade zone among Canada, Mexico, and the United States. NAFTA contains a rule of origin requirement that products be produced in one of the three countries in order to benefit from the agreement. NAFTA has phased out all trade restrictions and tariffs among the three countries on apparel products competitive with those of Alstyle. Alstyle manufactures all of its products in the Agua Prieta manufacturing plant and performs substantially all of its cutting and sewing in three plants located in Mexico in order to take advantage of the NAFTA benefits. Subsequent repeal or alteration of NAFTA could adversely affect our business (see below).\nThe Central American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cCAFTA\u201d) became effective May 28, 2004 and retroactive to January 1, 2004 for textiles and apparel. It creates a free trade zone similar to NAFTA by and between the United States and Central American countries (El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Dominican Republic). Textiles and apparel are duty-free and quota-free immediately if they meet the agreement\u2019s rule of origin, promoting new opportunities for U.S. and Central American fiber, yarn, fabric and apparel manufacturing. While CAFTA in the past afforded some advantages to Alstyle as they outsourced some of their U.S. produced fiber to Central America to cut/sew, with the transition of this production to Mexico this advantage went away. As such, we do not anticipate that the alteration or subsequent repeal of CAFTA would have a material effect on our operations.\nThe introduction of CAFTA took away most of the advantages NAFTA afforded to us domestically. However, NAFTA continues to afford us some advantage over CAFTA with respect to our sales in Canada. Currently, NAFTA produced goods can be shipped into Canada duty-free. The same protection is not currently afforded to CAFTA produced goods. However, CAFTA countries are in negotiation with the Canadian government to include Canada in CAFTA. If successful, this could potentially significantly impact our business in Canada. Recently, the governments of Canada and Honduras reached an agreement which basically affords goods produced in Honduras similar advantages to NAFTA produced goods with respect to Canadian importation. In addition to CAFTA, agreements such as Trans-Pacific Partnership (see below) and other similar agreements can further eliminate any advantages NAFTA affords to manufacturers.\nThe World Trade Organization (\u201cWTO\u201d), a multilateral trade organization, was formed in January 1995 and is the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (\u201cGATT\u201d). This multilateral trade organization has set forth mechanisms by which world trade in clothing is being progressively liberalized by phasing-out quotas and reducing duties over a period of time that began in January of 1995. As it implements the WTO mechanisms, the United States government is negotiating bilateral trade agreements with developing countries, which are generally exporters of textile and apparel products, that are members of the WTO to get them to reduce their tariffs on imports of textiles and apparel in exchange for reductions by the United States in tariffs on imports of textiles and apparel. In 2008 all import quotas for China were removed. A continued reduction of import quotas and tariffs could make Alstyle\u2019s products less competitive against low cost imports from developing countries (see discussion below).\nNew trade agreements like the recent agreement between Canada and Honduras, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (\u201cTPP\u201d) between the United States, Vietnam, Australia, Brunei, Chile, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru and Singapore, the Trans-Atlantic Trade Investment Partnership (\u201cTTIP\u201d) and the Trade in Services Agreement (\u201cTISA\u201d), which are meant to lower trade barriers, such as tariffs, could have significant impacts on domestic manufacturers. Such agreements could give lower labor-cost countries like Vietnam a significant advantage over Alstyle. One aspect of the agreement could potentially allow Asian countries that are part of the agreement to use China cotton, which would allow these countries to cut and sew their products in a low labor-cost country like Vietnam and then import their products into the U.S. and Canada duty-free. In addition, Canada has recently awarded\na duty-free status to Bangladesh and is currently in negotiations with Pakistan. Such developments as these could materially negatively impact Alstyle\u2019s operations domestically and in Canada.\nEnvironmental regulations may impact our future operating results.\nWe are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and foreign laws and regulations establishing health and environmental quality standards, concerning, among other things, wastewater discharges, air emissions and solid waste disposal, and may be subject to liability or penalties for violations of those standards. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing remediation of contamination at facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us or to which we have sent hazardous substances or wastes for treatment, recycling or disposal. We may be subject to future liabilities or obligations as a result of new or more stringent interpretations of existing laws and regulations. In addition, we may have liabilities or obligations in the future if we discover any environmental contamination or liability at any of our facilities, or at facilities we may acquire.\nOur manufacturing facility in Mexico is subject to certain risks regarding sales growth and cost savings as well as disruption in manufacturing risks.\nOur manufacturing facility in Agua Prieta, Mexico was built to capture anticipated future growth and savings in production costs over our cost structure in Anaheim, CA. If such growth or production savings do not materialize, it may negatively impact our ability to achieve our expected returns and our production levels, operational results and financial condition. In addition, our apparel manufacturing process from spinning through cutting occurs predominantly at our manufacturing facility located in Agua Prieta, Mexico, thus, any disruption in our utility services (i.e., water, electric, gas, etc.) can have a significant impact on our production levels, which depending on length of the disruption could significantly impact our sales and operational profitability.\nWe are exposed to the risk of non-payment by our customers on a significant amount of our sales.\nOur extension of credit involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of each customer\u2019s financial condition and payment history. We monitor our credit risk exposure by periodically obtaining credit reports and updated financials on our customers. We see a heightened amount of bankruptcies by our customers, especially retailers, during economic downturns. While we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables for potential credit losses based upon our historical trends and other available information, in times of economic turmoil, there is heightened risk that our historical indicators may prove to be inaccurate. The inability to collect on sales to significant customers or a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business incurs significant freight and transportation costs.\nWe incur significant freight costs to transport our goods, especially as it relates to our Apparel Segment where we transport yarn from our domestic suppliers to our textile facility in Mexico. The internal freight from the textile to the sewing facilities, as well as the logistic cost of keeping our product in the distribution centers to maintain our product close to the customer and on time to market is also significant. In addition, we incur transportation expenses to ship our products to our customers. Significant increases in the costs of freight and transportation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, as there can be no assurance that we could pass on these increased costs to our customers.\nThe price of energy is prone to significant fluctuations and volatility.\nOur apparel manufacturing operations require high inputs of energy, and therefore changes in energy prices directly impact our gross profit margins. We focus on manufacturing methods that will reduce the amount of energy used in the production of our apparel products to mitigate the rising costs of energy. Significant increases in energy prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, as there can be no assurance that we could pass these increased costs to our customers given the competitive environment in which our Apparel Segment operates.\nWe depend upon the talents and contributions of a limited number of individuals, many of whom would be difficult to replace.\nThe loss or interruption of the services of our Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President or Chief Financial Officer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Although we maintain employment agreements with these individuals, it cannot be assured that the services of such individuals will continue. On April 1, 2016 the Company entered into the Initial Purchase Agreement pursuant to which it agreed to sell the Apparel Segment to the Initial Buyer subject to certain fiduciary out provisions. In connection therewith, Mr. Ahmad the Company\u2019s Chief Technology Officer and Vice President of the Apparel Segment, has elected to be part of the initial buying group. As a result, Mr. Ahmad\u2019s employment agreement was transferred to A&G, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, and Mr. Ahmad resigned his position as an executive officer of the Company. On May 4, 2016, the Company received what its Board of Directors determined to be a superior offer, and terminated the Initial Unit Purchase Agreement and entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement with another buyer (see Item 1 - \u201cBusiness-Overview\u201d on page 4 of this Form 10-K (this \u201cReport\u201d) for further explanation regarding the pending sale of Alstyle Apparel, LLC).\nIncreases in the cost of employee benefits could impact our financial results and cash flow.\nOur expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant. Unfavorable changes in the cost of such benefits could impact our financial results and cash flow. Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform could result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Because of the many variables involved and the staggered implementation timeline, we cannot predict with any assurance the impact that the Healthcare Reform and interpretive legislation law and related regulations could have on the Company-sponsored medical plans. While the Company has various cost controls measures in place and employs outsight and outside cost reviews on larger claims, this has been and is expected to continue to be a significant cost to the Company.", "PERMNO": 47511, "SIC": 2761, "TIC": "EBF"}
