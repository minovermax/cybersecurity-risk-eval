{"cik": "1098146", "company": "PATRIOT NATIONAL BANCORP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operation are subject to various risks inherent to its business, including those noted below.\nThe risks involved in the Company\u2019s commercial real estate loan portfolio are material.\nThe Company\u2019s commercial real estate loan portfolio constitutes a material portion of the Bank\u2019s assets and generally have different risks than residential mortgage loans. Commercial real estate loans often involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers as compared to single-family residential loans.\nBecause the repayment of commercial real estate loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower\u2019s properties or related businesses, repayments of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or local economy. A downturn in the real estate market within the Company\u2019s market area may adversely impact the value of properties securing these loans. These risks are partially offset by shorter terms, reduced loan-to-value ratios and guarantors.\nReal estate lending in the Company\u2019s core market involves risks related to a decline in value of commercial and residential real estate.\nThe market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a relatively short period of time as a result of market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s total loan portfolio is secured by real estate located in Fairfield County, Connecticut and Westchester County, New York, areas historically of high affluence that had been materially impacted by the financial troubles experienced by large financial service companies on Wall Street and other companies during the financial crisis. Since then, credit markets have become tighter and underwriting standards more stringent and the inability of purchasers of real estate to obtain financing will continue to impact the real estate market. Therefore, these loans may be subject to changes in grade, classification, accrual status, foreclosure, or loss which could have an effect on the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to various lending and other economic risks that could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in economic conditions, particularly a continued economic slowdown in Fairfield County, Connecticut and the New York metropolitan area, could result in the following consequences, any of which may hurt the business of the Company materially:\n\u25cf\nloan delinquencies may increase\n\u25cf\nproblem assets and foreclosures may increase\n\u25cf\ndemand for the Bank\u2019s products and services may decline; and\n\u25cf\nAssets and collateral associated with the Bank\u2019s loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, thereby reducing a customer\u2019s borrowing power.\nDuring the years 2007 through 2009, the general economic conditions and specific business conditions in the United States, including Fairfield County, Connecticut and the New York metropolitan area, deteriorated, resulting in increases in loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures and declines in the value and collateral associated with the Bank\u2019s loans. During 2010 through 2015 however, the economic climate improved gradually, contributing to decreases in the Bank\u2019s non-performing assets.\nThe Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nLike all financial institutions, the Bank maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for loan defaults and non-performance. The allowance for loan losses is based on an evaluation of the risks associated with the Bank\u2019s loans receivable as well as the Bank\u2019s prior loss experience. Deterioration in general economic conditions and unforeseen risks affecting customers could have an adverse effect on borrowers\u2019 capacity to timely repay their obligations before risk grades could reflect those changing conditions. Maintaining the adequacy of the Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses may require that the Bank make significant and unanticipated increases in the provision for loan losses, which would materially affect the results of operations and capital adequacy. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates that may be beyond the Bank\u2019s control and these losses may exceed current estimates. Although the current economic environment has improved, conditions remain uncertain which may result in additional risk of loan losses.\nFederal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review the Bank\u2019s loans and assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The regulatory agencies may require us to change classifications or grades on loans, increase the allowance for loan losses with additional provisions for loan losses and to recognize further loan charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may differ from the Bank\u2019s. Any increase in the allowance for loan losses required by these regulatory agencies could have a negative effect on the Bank\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. While management believes that the allowance for loan losses is currently adequate to cover inherent losses, further loan deterioration could occur and therefore management cannot assure shareholders that there will not be a need to increase the allowance for loan losses or that the regulators will not require management to increase this allowance. Either of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings and profitability.\nThe Company is subject to certain risks with respect to liquidity.\n\"Liquidity\" refers to the Company\u2019s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support its operations and to fulfill its obligations, including commitments to originate loans, to repay its wholesale borrowings and other liabilities, and to satisfy the withdrawal of deposits by its customers.\nThe Company\u2019s primary sources of liquidity are the deposits it acquires organically through its branch network, borrowed funds, primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings, and the cash flows generated through the repayment of loans and securities. In addition, depending on current market conditions, the Company may have the ability to access the capital markets.\nDeposit flows, calls of investment securities and wholesale borrowings, and prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities are strongly influenced by such external factors as the direction of interest rates, whether actual or perceived; local and national economic conditions; and competition for deposits and loans in the markets it serve. Furthermore, changes to the underwriting guidelines for wholesale borrowings or lending policies may limit or restrict the Company\u2019s ability to borrow, and could therefore have a significant adverse impact on its liquidity. A decline in available funding could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to originate loans, invest in securities, and meet its expenses, or to fulfill such obligations as repaying its borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nThe Company is unable to predict with certainty, fluctuations of market interest rates, which are affected by many factors including inflation, recession, a rise in unemployment, a tightening money supply, domestic and international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets. Changes in the interest rate environment may reduce the Company\u2019s profits. The Company realizes income from the differential or \u201cspread\u201d between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets, and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, an increase in the general level of interest rates may adversely affect the ability of some borrowers to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations. Although the Company has implemented strategies which are designed to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on operations, these strategies may not always be successful. Accordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s net interest spread, asset quality, levels of prepayments and cash flow as well as the market value of its securities portfolio and overall profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s investment portfolio includes securities which are sensitive to interest rates and variations in interest rates may adversely impact the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s security portfolio is classified as available-for-sale, and is comprised primarily of debt and mortgage-backed securities, which are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, and corporate bonds. These securities are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Unrealized gains or losses in the available-for-sale portfolio for securities are reported as a separate component of shareholders\u2019 equity. As a result, future interest rate fluctuations may impact shareholders\u2019 equity, causing material fluctuations from quarter to quarter. The inability to hold its securities until maturity, or until payments are received on mortgage-backed securities, or until market conditions are favorable for a sale, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings and profitability.\nThe Company is dependent on its management team and the loss of its senior executive officers or other key employees could impair its relationship with its customers and adversely affect its business and financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s success is dependent upon the continued services and skills of its management team. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these key personnel, because of their skills, knowledge of the Company\u2019s market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s success also depends, in part, on its continued ability to attract and retain experienced commercial lenders and retail bankers, as well as other management personnel. The loss of the services of several of such key personnel could adversely affect the Company\u2019s growth and prospects to the extent it is unable to quickly replace such personnel. Competition for commercial lenders and retail bankers is strong, and the Company may not be successful in retaining or attracting such personnel.\nA breach of information security could negatively affect the Company\u2019s earnings.\nThe Company increasingly depends upon data processing, communications and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks, and the internet to conduct its business. The Company cannot be certain that all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack, despite safeguards it has instituted. In addition, the Company relies on the services of a variety of vendors to meet its data processing and communication needs. If information security is breached, information can be lost or misappropriated and could result in financial loss or costs to the Company or damages to others. These costs or losses could materially exceed the amount of insurance coverage, if any, which would have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the Bank\u2019s reputation could be harmed, which also could materially affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank is subject to environmental liability risk associated with its lending activities.\nA significant portion of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, the Bank may foreclose on, and take title to, properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties, which may make the Bank liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. In addition, the Bank owns and operates certain properties that may be subject to similar environmental liability risks.\nEnvironmental laws may require the Bank to incur substantial expense and may materially reduce the affected property's value, or limit the Bank\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the Bank\u2019s exposure to environmental liability. Although the Company has policies and procedures requiring the performance of an environmental site assessment before loan approval or initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these assessments may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company relies on the dividends it receives from its subsidiary.\nThe Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank, and all of the revenues the Company receives consist of dividends from the Bank. These dividends are the primary funding source for the interest and principal payments on its debt. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that a bank may pay to its parent company. In addition, the Company\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary may be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, it may not be able to pay its obligations. The inability to receive dividends from the Bank could therefore have a material adverse effect on its business, its financial condition, and its results of operations, as well as its ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock may fluctuate.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to changes in sentiment in the market regarding the Company\u2019s operations or business prospects. Among other factors, the Company\u2019s stock price may be affected by:\n\u25cf\noperating results that vary from the expectations of management or of securities analysts and investors;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments in the business or in the financial services sector generally;\n\u25cf\nregulatory or legislative changes affecting the industry generally or the business and operations;\n\u25cf\noperating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to the Company;\n\u25cf\nchanges in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or rating agencies;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of strategic developments, acquisitions, dispositions, financings, and other material events by the Company or the Company\u2019s competitors; and\n\u25cf\nchanges or volatility in global financial markets and economies, general market conditions, interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity, credit, or asset valuations.\nDifficult market conditions have adversely affected the Company\u2019s industry.\nThe Company is exposed to downturns in the U.S. economy, and particularly the local markets in which it operates in Connecticut and New York. During the financial crisis, declines in the housing market with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures, unemployment and under-employment, had negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage and construction loans and resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including government-sponsored enterprises as well as major commercial and investment banks. These write-downs caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, to merge with larger and stronger institutions and, in some cases, to fail. Many lenders and institutional investors reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers, including other financial institutions. This market turmoil and the tightening of credit led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence, increased market volatility and generally widespread reductions in business activity. The resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets have adversely affected The Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. A worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on the Company and other financial institutions. In particular:\n\u25cf\nEconomic conditions may continue to affect market confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies, which could affect the Bank\u2019s charge-offs and provision for loan losses.\n\u25cf\nThe ability to assess the creditworthiness of the Bank\u2019s customers or to estimate the values of collateral for loans may be impaired if the models and approaches the Bank uses becomes less predictive of future behaviors, valuations, assumptions or estimates due to the unpredictable economic climate.\n\u25cf\nIncreasing consolidation of financial services companies as a result of current market conditions could have unexpected adverse effects upon the Bank\u2019s ability to compete effectively.\nThe Bank may be required to pay significantly higher FDIC premiums, special assessments, or taxes that could adversely affect its earnings.\nMarket developments have significantly impacted the insurance fund of the FDIC. As a result, the Bank may be required to pay higher premiums or additional special assessments that could adversely affect its earnings. The Bank is generally unable to control the amount of premiums that it is required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional banks or financial institution failures, the Bank may be required to pay higher FDIC premiums than are currently assessed. These increases and any future increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums may materially adversely affect the results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with taxation.\nThe amount of income taxes the Company is required to pay on its earnings is based on federal and state legislation and regulations. The Company provides for current and deferred taxes in its financial statements, based on the results of operations, business activity, legal structure, interpretation of tax statutes, assessment of risk of adjustment upon audit, and application of financial accounting standards. The Company may take tax return filing positions for which the final determination of tax is uncertain. The Company\u2019s net income and earnings per share may be reduced if a federal, state, or local authority assesses additional taxes that have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve its anticipated effective tax rate either due to a change in a tax law, a change in regulatory or judicial guidance, or an audit assessment which denies previously recognized tax benefits.\nRisks associated with changes in technology.\nFinancial products and services have become increasingly technology-driven. The Bank\u2019s ability to meet the needs of its customers competitively, and in a cost-efficient manner, is dependent on its ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available. Many of the Bank\u2019s competitors have greater resources to invest in technology than the Bank does and may be better equipped to market new technology-driven products and services. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and the failure to do so on the part of the Bank could have a material adverse impact on its business and therefore on the financial condition and results of operations.\nStrong competition within the Company\u2019s market area may limit the growth and profitability of the Company.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. The Fairfield County, Connecticut and the New York City metropolitan areas have a high concentration of financial institutions including large money center and regional banks, community banks and credit unions. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors offer products and services that the Bank currently does not offer, such as private banking and trust services. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than the Company and may offer certain services that the Company does not or cannot provide. Price competition for loans and deposits might result in the Bank earning less on its loans and paying more for deposits, which would reduce net interest income. The Company expects competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes. The Company\u2019s profitability depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete in its market area.\nGovernment regulation may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability and growth.\nThe Company is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as the Bank\u2019s chartering authority, by the FDIC, as insurer of its deposits, and by the Federal Reserve Board as regulator of the Company. Changes in state and federal banking laws and regulations or in federal monetary policies could adversely affect the Bank\u2019s ability to maintain profitability and continue to grow and, in light of recent economic conditions, such changes are expected but cannot be predicted. For example, new legislation or regulation could limit the manner in which the Company may conduct its business, including the Bank\u2019s ability to obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads. The laws, regulations, interpretations and enforcement policies that apply to the Company have been subject to significant, and sometimes retroactively applied, changes in recent years, and are likely to change significantly in the future.\nLegislation proposing significant structural reforms to the financial services industry considered in the U.S. Congress has, among other things, created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which gives broad authority to regulate financial service providers and financial products. In addition, the Federal Reserve Bank has passed guidance on incentive compensation at the banking organizations it regulates and the United States Department of the Treasury and the federal banking regulators have issued statements calling for higher capital and liquidity requirements for banking organization. Complying with any new legislative or regulatory requirements, and any programs established thereunder by federal and state governments could have an adverse impact on the results of operations and the ability to fill positions with the most qualified candidates available.\nChanging regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure.\nThe Company is subject to Laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, SEC regulations and NASDAQ rules. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could make compliance more difficult and result in higher costs. The Company is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, the Company\u2019s efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. The Company\u2019s reputation may be harmed if it does not continue to comply with these laws, regulations and standards.\nThe earnings of financial institutions are significantly affected by general business and economic conditions.\nAs a financial institution, the Company\u2019s operations and profitability are impacted by general business and economic conditions in the United States and abroad. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, money supply, political issues, legislative and regulatory changes and the strength of the U.S. economy and the local economies in which it operates, all of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. In recent years, the banking world has experienced unprecedented upheaval, including the failure of some of the leading financial institutions in the world. Further deterioration in economic conditions could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and non-performing assets, decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for the Bank\u2019s products and services, among other things, any of which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition and for which the Company cannot currently predict or implement plans to combat.\nThe Company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NASDAQ rules and, as a result, the Company qualifies for, and relies on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nPNBK Holdings LLC controls a majority of the Company\u2019s voting common stock. As a result, the Company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NASDAQ corporate governance standards. Under the NASDAQ rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is considered a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d which may utilize exemptions relating to certain NASDAQ corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u25cf\nThe requirement that the Company have a Nominating and Governance Committee that is composed entirely of independent directors;\n\u25cf\nThe requirement that the Company have a Compensation Committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; and\n\u25cf\nThe requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the Nominating and Governance and Compensation Committees.\nAs a result of these exemptions, the Company\u2019s Nominating and Governance Committee and Compensation Committee do not consist entirely of independent directors and the Company is not required to have an annual performance evaluation of the Nominating and Governance and Compensation Committees. Accordingly, a holder of its common stock will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements.", "PERMNO": 80837, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PNBK"}
