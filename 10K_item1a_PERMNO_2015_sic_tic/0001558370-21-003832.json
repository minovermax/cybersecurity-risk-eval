{"cik": "1136294", "company": "Williams Industrial Services Group Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by one or more of the following factors, any of which could cause actual results to vary materially from historical and current results or anticipated future results.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe may not generate sufficient cash resources to continue funding our operations.\nWe require substantial working capital in order to meet the demands of our growing business. If our liquidity generating initiatives do not produce the expected results, or if we are otherwise unable to obtain sufficient cash resources to operate our business, we may need to raise additional debt capital or sell assets outside the normal course of business. For additional information, please refer to \u201cPart II-Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and \u201cNote 11-Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nIf we do not timely pay amounts due and comply with the covenants under our debt facilities, our business, financial condition, and ability to continue as a going concern would be materially and adversely impacted.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Term Loan, among other things, requires high interest payments, and both the Term Loan and the PNC Facility, place encumbrances on our assets, and subject us to restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility. Additionally, under the terms of the Term Loan, the Company is required to make quarterly loan amortization payments of $0.3 million per quarter through December 16, 2025.\nThe terms of the Term Loan and the PNC Facility have been structured in such a way that, if we default under one, we will also default under the other. In the event of a continuing default, our senior secured lenders would have the right to accelerate the then-outstanding amounts under each such facility and to exercise their respective rights and remedies to collect such amounts, which would include foreclosing on collateral constituting substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries. Any continuing default on the Term Loan or the PNC Facility could result in the outstanding principal balance under each such facility becoming immediately due and payable. We do not currently have sufficient cash on hand to repay the outstanding balances, so if our lenders under the Term Loan and the PNC Facility exercised their rights and remedies as permitted by each such facility and applicable law, we would likely be forced to seek bankruptcy protection and our investors could lose the full value of their investment in our common stock. Accordingly, a default could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFor additional information, please refer to \u201cPart II-Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and \u201cNote 11-Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nThe limitations and covenants in our debt facilities constrain our ability to borrow additional money, sell assets and make acquisitions, which may impair our ability to fully implement elements of our business strategy and otherwise adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nBoth the Term Loan and the PNC Facility contain certain limitations and covenants that limit our ability, and that of our subsidiaries, to, among other things, incur additional debt, make capital expenditures, incur liens, pay dividends or make other restricted payments, merge or sell assets, make acquisitions, and enter into transactions with affiliates.\nThe Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR, plus a margin of 8.50% (if the total leverage ratio is less than 2.50:1) or 9.00% per year (if the total leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 2.50:1), subject to a minimum LIBOR floor of 1.00%, payable in cash on a quarterly basis. In addition, upon the occurrence of an event of default, and for so long as such event of default continues, default interest equal to 2.00% per year in excess of the rate otherwise applicable will be payable. Our obligations under the Term Loan are guaranteed by certain of our material, wholly-owned subsidiaries, subject to customary exceptions, and are secured by first-priority security interests in substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries guaranteeing our obligations, as well as a second-priority security interest on such entities\u2019 accounts receivable and inventory, subject to the intercreditor agreement with PNC. Borrowings under the PNC Facility bear interest, at our election, at either (1) the base commercial lending rate of PNC, as publicly announced, plus 1.25%, payable in cash on a monthly basis, (2) the 30, 60 or 90 day LIBOR rate, subject to minimum LIBOR floor of 1.00%, payable in cash on the last day of each interest period, or (3) with respect to Canadian dollar loans, the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (\u201cCDOR\u201d), subject to a minimum CDOR rate of 1.00%, payable in cash on a monthly basis. In addition, upon the occurrence of an event of default, and for so long as such event of default continues, default interest equal to 2.00% per year in excess of the rate otherwise applicable will be payable. Our obligations under the PNC Facility are guaranteed by certain of our material, wholly-owned subsidiaries, subject to customary exceptions, and are secured by first-priority security interests on substantially all of our and such subsidiaries\u2019 accounts and a second-priority security interest in substantially all other assets of such entities, subject to the terms of the intercreditor agreement. Any increase in LIBOR or the cessation of LIBOR as a viable reference rate may result in an increase in our interest rates on our outstanding principal debt under our debt facilities and therefore negatively affect our cash flow and financial condition.\nBoth facilities also include additional restrictive covenants, including covenants under the Term Loan that require us to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and covenants under the PNC Facility that require us to maintain a springing minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. If we do not comply with the restrictive covenants, including failing to satisfy the required financial covenants, or obtain waivers as needed, our lenders could accelerate our debt and foreclose on our assets, and our stockholders may lose the full value of an investment in our common stock. Our ability to comply with the restrictive covenants in the debt facilities depends upon our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, as well as other general economic and competitive conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on us and our customers. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our cash requirements and debt service obligations, and we may continue to face significant liquidity constraints. For additional information, please refer to \u201cPart II-Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and \u201cNote 11-Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nFurther, we and our liquidity, as well as our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements, may be adversely affected to some degree by the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently believe that the impact of COVID-19 on us will not negatively impact our ability to comply with the covenants under our existing debt facilities. However, we cannot provide any assurance that the assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements will remain accurate due to the unprecedented nature and the unpredictability of the COVID-19 global pandemic and its potential impact on us and our customer base. As a consequence, our estimates of the duration of the pandemic and its impact on our future earnings and cash flows could change, and the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAny inability to finance our business or repay the Term Loan and the PNC Facility, including due to deterioration of the credit markets, could adversely affect our business.\nWe intend to finance our existing operations and initiatives with existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, the Term Loan and the PNC Facility. The Term Loan and the PNC Facility contain a number of restrictive covenants and other terms that limit our operating flexibility. Any deterioration in the credit markets, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect the ability of many of our customers to pay us on time and the ability of many of our suppliers to meet our needs on a competitive basis. Any inability to pay amounts due under the Term Loan and the PNC Facility or access necessary additional funds on acceptable terms or at all may negatively impact our business or operations. In addition, we may require additional sources of funds in order to meet the working capital requirements of our growing business. If we\nare unable to access sufficient capital from our existing lenders or otherwise, our business and operations would be adversely impacted. For additional information, please refer to \u201cPart II-Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and \u201cNote 11-Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nWe are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates.\nWe are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates. The Term Loan and the PNC Facility provide for variable rates of interest based on LIBOR. The United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has publicly announced that it intends to discontinue the reporting of certain LIBOR rates after 2021, with a complete cessation for all USD LIBOR rates after June 2023. The future of LIBOR at this time remains uncertain, and any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to LIBOR\u2019s phase out could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which was convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as an alternative to LIBOR. Although our debt facilities include customary LIBOR replacement provisions that contemplate an alternate benchmark rate to be mutually agreed upon by us and the administrative agent, if necessary, any such changes may result in interest obligations which are more than or do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made if LIBOR was available in its current form. As a result, there can be no assurance that discontinuation of LIBOR will not result in significant increases in benchmark interest rates, substantially higher financing costs or a shortage of available debt financing, any of which could have an adverse effect on us.\nIf we become unable to obtain adequate surety bonding, it could reduce our ability to bid on new work, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and business prospects.\nConsistent with industry practice, we are at times required to provide performance and payment surety bonds to customers. These bonds provide credit support for the customer if we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. If security is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain a bond on terms commercially acceptable to us, we may not be able to pursue that project. In addition, bonding may be more difficult to obtain in the future or may only be available at significant additional cost.\nIf we become unable to obtain adequate letters of credit, our ability to bid on new work could be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and business prospects.\nIn line with industry practice, we are at times required to provide letters of credit. These letters of credit provide credit support for the client if we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. Each of the Term Loan and the PNC Facility contains restrictions on the maximum amount that may be drawn against letters of credit. The PNC Facility provides for a letter of credit sublimit in an amount up to $2.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any letters of credit outstanding under the PNC Facility letter of credit sublimit and had $0.5 million outstanding cash collateralized standby letters of credit pursuant to our prior revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, which we refinanced and replaced in June 2017. If security is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain a letter of credit on terms commercially acceptable to us, we may not be able to pursue that project. Any inability to obtain letters of credit on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and business prospects.\nLiabilities, fees, and expenses related to the Koontz-Wagner bankruptcy filing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nWe may incur future liabilities as a result of the July 11, 2018 bankruptcy filing of our Koontz-Wagner subsidiary, and defending any claims relating to the Koontz-Wagner bankruptcy could require us to incur substantial legal fees and other expenses. Any such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. For additional information, please refer to \u201cNote 5-Changes in Business\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nChanges to tax regulations, laws, accounting principles, future business operations or examinations by tax authorities may adversely impact our provision for income taxes and ability to use deferred tax assets, increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact our effective tax rate and results of operations. For instance, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) (i) reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, (ii) generally limited our annual deductions for interest expense to no more than 30% of our \u201cadjusted taxable income\u201d (plus 100% of our business interest income) for the year and (iii) permitted us to offset only 80% (rather than 100%) of our taxable income with any NOLs we generate after 2017. The disallowed interest and NOLs generated after 2017 can be carried to future periods indefinitely. It is possible in the future that the NOL and/or interest deductibility limitations could have the effect of causing us to incur income tax liability sooner than we otherwise would have incurred such liability or, in certain cases, could cause us to incur income tax liability that we might otherwise not have incurred, in the absence of these tax law changes. Certain aspects of the Tax Act remain subject to developing interpretation and clarification. Further, the new presidential administration could introduce modifications, technical corrections or clarifications to the Tax Act or other changes in tax laws, including an increase in the corporate tax rate.\nIn addition, our ability to use our deferred tax assets is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings differing materially from our projections, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, expiration of or lapses in tax credits, changes in ownership as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), and outcomes as a result of tax examinations or changes in tax laws, regulations and accounting principles. As a result, our income tax provisions are also subject to volatility from these changes, as well as changes in accounting for uncertain tax positions, or interpretations thereof.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in GAAP related to accounting for income taxes. In addition, GAAP applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which, if settled unfavorably, could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital. We could also be subject to examinations of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There may be exposure that the outcomes from these examinations will have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nFurthermore, as we expand our operations outside of the U.S., our future effective tax rates could also be adversely affected, including limitations on the ability to defer U.S. taxation on earnings outside the U.S. until those earnings are repatriated to the U.S.\nOur ability to use NOL carryforwards or other tax attributes may be subject to limitations under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had U.S. federal tax NOL, foreign tax credits and general business tax credit carryforwards of $220.6 million, $4.5 million, and $0.4 million, respectively. Generally, NOL, foreign tax credit and general business credit carryforwards may be used to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce or eliminate U.S. federal income tax liabilities. Section 382 of the Code limits a corporation\u2019s ability to utilize NOL carryforwards to reduce tax liabilities if the corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change.\u201d For these purposes, an ownership change is deemed to occur if there has been a change of more than 50% in the ownership of shareholders owning 5% or greater of the value of a corporation\u2019s stock over a three-year period. Code Section 383 applies the same limitations to foreign tax credit, general business credit and capital loss carryforwards after an ownership change.\nBased upon our review, we had not experienced an ownership change as defined under Code Section 382 as of December 31, 2020. If we issue additional equity in the future, an ownership change pursuant to Code Section 382 may occur. In addition, an ownership change under Code Section 382 could be caused by circumstances beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as market purchases or sales by certain 5% or greater shareholders of our stock. There is also a risk that, due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. In addition, under the Tax Act, the amount of NOLs incurred after the end of the 2017 fiscal year that we are permitted to deduct in any taxable year is limited to 80% of our taxable income in such year, where taxable income is determined without regard to the NOL deduction itself. The Tax Act also generally eliminates the ability to carry back any NOLs to prior taxable years, while allowing post-2017 unused NOLs to be carried forward indefinitely. There is a risk that, due to changes under the Tax Act, regulatory changes, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Thus, there can be no assurance that the Company\nwill not experience an ownership change which would significantly limit the utilization of the Company\u2019s NOL, foreign tax credit or general business credit carryforwards in calculating future federal tax liabilities.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected, and may further adversely affect, our business, operating and financial results, and liquidity, and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in the future.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, and the President of the United States declared the outbreak a national emergency. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, federal, provincial, state, county and local governments and public health organizations and authorities around the world have implemented a variety of measures intended to control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, \u201cshelter-in-place,\u201d \u201cstay-at-home\u201d and similar orders, travel restrictions, school closures, business curtailments and closures, social distancing and hygiene requirements, and other measures. While some of these restrictions have been lifted in certain regions, others have maintained such measures; in addition, as COVID-19 cases increased in certain locations, previously lifted measures were, in some cases, reimposed, and, in other locations, such restrictions may still be reimposed, or additional restrictions put in place.\nOur results for the year ended December 31, 2020 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we anticipate that our future results of operations will continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, but at this time we do not currently expect that the impact from the COVID-19 outbreak will have a material effect on our liquidity or financial position. The severity, magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak is uncertain, rapidly changing, and hard to predict. While the full impact of COVID-19 and the long-term worldwide reaction to it and impact from it remains unknown at this time, government reactions to the pandemic and restrictions and limitations applied by such governments as a result, any new widespread growth in infections, the emergence of new variants of COVID-19, travel restrictions, quarantines, or site closures as a result of the virus could, among other things, impact the ability of our employees and our contractors to perform their duties, cause increased technology and security risk due to extended and Company-wide telecommuting, lead to disruptions in our supply chain (including necessary vendors or service providers), lead to a disruption in our infrastructure acquisition or permitting activities and cause disruption in our relationship with our customers.\nFor example, as a result of the pandemic and various governmental orders, a significant number of our corporate, accounting and finance employees are currently working remotely, and we have altered our operations to allow for appropriate social distancing and hygiene, invested in additional employee safety equipment, implemented additional cleaning measures, and adapted new processes for interactions with our suppliers and customers to safely manage our operations, any or all of which could lead to decreased efficiency and productivity in our workforce and our operations. In addition, management is focused on mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has required and will continue to require a large investment of time, energy, resources, and focus. Among other work site actions, in April 2020, we experienced a temporary closure on an energy and industrial project in New York and, in July 2020, we implemented stricter safety precautions due to an increase in COVID-19 cases at a nuclear project in Georgia. We have also experienced a slow-down in business development activities and bid opportunities, particularly in Ontario, Canada. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately impacts us will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the following: the severity of the virus, including the emergence of new variants, some of which may be more transmissible than the initial strain; the ultimate duration and scope of the pandemic; the impact of COVID-19 vaccines, including the speed at which they are approved and disseminated and their effectiveness against COVID-19 and its evolving strains; governmental, business, individual and other actions taken in response to the pandemic; the effect on our suppliers and disruptions to the global supply chain; the extent and duration of the impact on the economy and spending; the effect on our customers and their ability to pay for our services; the effect of any closures or other changes in operations of our and our suppliers\u2019 or customers\u2019 facilities; the health of and the effect on our employees and our ability to meet staffing needs in our construction and other critical functions, particularly if and when employees become ill, are quarantined as a result of exposure, or are reluctant to show up for work; our ability to provide services, including as a result of travel restrictions, work from home requirements and arrangements, and other restrictions or changes in behavior or preferences for interactions; the effect on employee healthcare costs; restrictions or disruptions to transportation; the potential effects on our internal controls, including those over financial reporting, as a result of changes in working arrangements that are applicable to our employees and business partners; and the effect on our ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet our liquidity needs, as well as our ability to remain in compliance with the covenants of our debt facilities.\nAdditionally, the COVID-19 outbreak has significantly negatively impacted economic activity and markets around the world, and COVID-19 or another similar outbreak could negatively impact our business in numerous ways, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf our revenue may be reduced if the current economic recession caused by the pandemic continues for an extended period of time, to the extent our customers are materially negatively impacted or it leads to a prolonged decrease in the demand for natural gas, and, to a lesser extent, natural gas liquids and/or crude oil;\n\u25cf our operations may be disrupted or impaired if a significant portion of our employees or our contractors are unable to work due to illness or if our operations are suspended or temporarily shut-down or restricted due to control measures designed to contain the pandemic or a specific outbreak;\n\u25cf the operations of our upstream counterparties, our suppliers, and our vendors may be curtailed by many of the same challenges we face and, as such, may not be able to meet their minimum volume delivery obligations under their agreements with us; and\n\u25cf the disruption and instability in the financial markets and the uncertainty in the general business environment may affect opportunities to enhance our liquidity position and long-term financial flexibility.\nAny recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic impact may also be slowed or reversed by a number of factors, including any widespread resurgence in COVID-19 infections. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. In addition, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening or exacerbating many of the other risks set forth in this item.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is related to services performed at nuclear power plants, and reduced investment in, or increased regulation related to, nuclear power plants could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nThe demand for the services we provide at nuclear power plants is directly tied to the number of nuclear power facilities that utilize our services. Additionally, the demand for U.S. nuclear capacity and electricity generation is expected to decline due to continuing low natural gas prices and the rapid expansion of low-cost renewable energy and new technologies in the U.S., displacing more traditional sources of power, including nuclear power. Declining demand for U.S. nuclear power generation and related construction and maintenance budgets could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and cash flow.\nThere are two new nuclear power plants at one U.S. site under construction, and several nuclear reactors are undergoing decommissioning. Pricing pressure has resulted in a decrease in the maintenance budgets for existing nuclear plants. Other new construction projects were reevaluated and discontinued in 2017. For example, during 2017, the owners of V.C. Summer Units 2 and 3 abandoned the project.\nIn addition, decreases in state and federal government subsidies and increased regulation could negatively impact the financial viability of merchant nuclear power plants, decreasing the demand for the services we provide.\nIf our costs exceed the estimates we use to set the fixed prices on certain of our contracts, our earnings will be reduced.\nFixed-price contracts present certain inherent risks, including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received, erroneous or incomplete cost estimates, problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period.\nIn addition, we have a limited ability to recover any cost overruns. Contract prices are established based in part on our projected costs, which are subject to a number of assumptions. The costs that we incur in connection with each contract can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original projections. Because of the large scale and complexity of our contracts, unanticipated changes may occur, such as customer budget decisions, design changes, delays in receiving permits and cost increases. Unanticipated cost increases or delays may occur as a result of several factors, including: increases in the cost of commodities, labor or freight; unanticipated technical problems; problems related to successfully managing contract\nperformance; suppliers\u2019 or subcontractors\u2019 failure to perform, requiring modified execution plans or re-work; and decreases in labor efficiency realized.\nWe often are contractually subject to liquidated damages in the event that we fail to perform our obligations in a timely manner. Such damages can be significant and may have a negative impact on our profit margins and financial results.\nCost increases or overruns that we cannot pass on to our customers or our payment of liquidated damages or other penalties under our contracts will lower our earnings. In addition, increases in commodity prices may adversely affect our gross margins.\nIf we are unable to control the delivery of services provided because of internal operational issues or poor subcontractor performances, our reputation could be adversely affected, and we could lose customers. In the event of subcontractor insolvency, if we are unable to recover any advance progress payments made to subcontractors, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on subcontractors to perform services on various projects for scopes of work that are outside of our current service offerings. Our subcontractors do not account for a significant percentage of our service costs. The quality and performance of our subcontractors are not entirely under our control. Our subcontractors may not always meet the requisite level of quality control or our delivery schedules. The failure of our subcontractors to perform quality services in a timely manner could adversely affect our reputation and result in the cancellation of orders for our services, significant warranty and repair costs and the loss of customers. In addition, our contracts with customers may contain liquidated damages, and triggering such provisions could result in significant financial penalties, or, even if not triggered, could affect our ability to recognize revenue in a given period.\nOther potential consequences of the failure of our subcontractors to meet our standards include a potential need to change subcontractors, resulting in increased costs. At times, we make advance progress payments to subcontractors in anticipation of completion of services, and we may be unable to recover those advances if a subcontractor fails to complete the scope of work. In addition, we generally provide warranties for terms of two years or less on our services; defects with respect to services previously provided, whether caused by our actions or a subcontractor\u2019s, could require us to incur costs fixing such issues. The occurrence of any of the above may adversely affect our financial condition, profitability, and cash flow.\nWe operate our business in regions subject to natural disasters, including hurricanes, and other severe catastrophic events, such as public health emergencies, acts of war and terrorism, and any disruption to our business resulting from such events will adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nWe operate our business in regions subject to natural disasters and other severe catastrophic events. Any disaster could adversely affect our ability to conduct business and provide services to our customers, and the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from any business interruption resulting from a natural disaster or other catastrophic events. These and any future disruptions to our operations, including outbreak of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments, epidemics or pandemics, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, acts of war, terrorism or other force majeure, could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive. Some of our competitors and potential competitors are less leveraged than we are, have greater financial or other resources than we have and may be better able to withstand adverse market conditions within the industry. Our competitors typically compete aggressively on the basis of pricing, and such competition may continue to impact our ability to attract and retain customers or maintain the rates we charge. To the extent that we choose to match our competitors\u2019 prices, it may result in lower margins and, as a result, could harm our results of operations. Should we choose not to match, or remain within a reasonable competitive distance from, our competitors\u2019 pricing, our sales volume would likely decrease, which could harm our results of operations. In addition, our future growth will depend on our ability to gauge the direction of the commercial and technological progress in our markets that may be adopted by our competitors. However, any such developments would likely require additional financing, and we may not be able to obtain the necessary financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A failure to keep pace with our competitors or the technological innovations in the markets we serve could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur future revenue and operating results may vary significantly from reporting period to reporting period.\nOur quarterly and annual revenue and earnings have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future. Our service contracts contain customer-specific commercial terms that, coupled with other factors beyond our control, may result in uneven\nrecognition of revenue and earnings over time. Customer-imposed delays can significantly impact the timing of revenue recognition and lengthen our cash conversion cycle. Due to our relatively large average contract size, our volume during any given period may be concentrated to relatively few contracts, intensifying the magnitude of these fluctuations. Furthermore, some of our operating costs are fixed. As a result, we may have limited ability to reduce our operating costs in response to unanticipated decreases in our revenue or the demand for our services in any given reporting period. Therefore, our operating results in any reporting period may not be indicative of our future performance. Because we must make significant estimates related to potential costs when we recognize revenue on a percentage-of-completion basis, these costs may change significantly from reporting period to reporting period based on new project information.\nA small number of major customers account for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of any of these customers could negatively impact our business.\nWe depend on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue. In 2020, four customers accounted for 62%, and in 2019, four customers accounted for 72%, of our consolidated revenue. For a listing of our major customers, please refer to \u201cNote 16-Major Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. We expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenue. Because our major customers represent a large part of our business, the loss of any of our major customers could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Our business volume with each of our largest customers is highly dependent on operations and maintenance budgets for U.S. utilities. Fluctuations in any of these factors could materially adversely impact our financial results.\nWe are subject to potential insolvency or financial distress of third parties, including our customers and suppliers.\nWe are exposed to the risk that third parties to various arrangements who owe us money or goods, or who purchase services from us, will be unable to perform their obligations or continue to place orders due to insolvency or financial distress. If such third parties fail to perform their obligations under arrangements with us, we may be forced to replace the underlying commitment at current or above market prices or on other terms that are less favorable to us, or we may have to write off receivables in the case of a customer failing to pay.\nIf a customer becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover accounts receivable from that customer would be adversely affected and any payment we received during the preference period prior to a bankruptcy filing may be potentially recoverable by the bankruptcy estate. Any of the foregoing could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.\nThe dollar amount of our backlog, as stated at any time, is not necessarily indicative of our future revenue.\nOur backlog consists of firm orders or blanket authorizations from our customers. Backlog may vary significantly from reporting period to reporting period due to the timing of customer commitments. The time between receipt of an order and actual completion of services can vary. However, backlog may not be indicative of future operating results, and projects in our backlog may be cancelled, modified, or otherwise altered by our customers. To the extent projects are delayed, the timing of our revenue could be affected. If a customer cancels an order, we may be reimbursed for the costs we have incurred. Typically, however, we have no contractual right to the full amount of the revenue reflected in our backlog contracts in the event of cancellation. In addition, projects may remain in our backlog for extended periods of time. Furthermore, a portion of our backlog for multi-year service maintenance contracts is based on what we expect to realize in the future and is therefore not necessarily supported by a firm purchase order. If that work does not materialize, then our backlog would be negatively impacted, as that work would be considered a \u201ccancellation.\u201d Revenue recognition occurs over extended periods of time and is subject to unanticipated delays. Fluctuations in our reported backlog levels also result from the fact that we may receive a small number of relatively large orders in any given reporting period that may be included in our backlog. Because of these large orders, our backlog in that reporting period may reach levels that may not be sustained in subsequent reporting periods. Our backlog, therefore, is not necessarily indicative of our future revenue or of long-term industry trends.\nOur success is partially dependent upon maintaining our safety record, and an injury to or death of any of our employees, customers or vendors could result in material liabilities to our Company.\nThe activities we conduct at our customers\u2019 facilities present a risk of injury or death to our employees, customers, or visitors, notwithstanding our efforts to comply with safety regulations. We may be unable to avoid material liabilities for an injury or death, and our workers\u2019 compensation and other insurance policies may not be adequate or may not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could result in material liabilities to us. In addition, our ability to obtain new business and retain our current business is partially dependent on our continuing ability to maintain a safety record that\nexceeds the industry average. If we fail to maintain superior safety performance, or if serious accidents occur in spite of our safety procedures, our revenue and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nAdverse changes in our relationships with suppliers, vendors, and subcontractors, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our business, reputation, and results of operations.\nWe rely significantly on third-party suppliers and vendors to obtain necessary materials, and on subcontractors to perform certain services. Although we are not dependent on any single supplier, vendor or subcontractor, any substantial limitation on the availability of or deterioration in our relationship with required suppliers or subcontractors would negatively impact our operations.\nChanges in our credit profile can affect the way such third parties view our ability to make payments and may induce them to shorten the payment terms of their invoices or require credit enhancement. For instance, as a result of delays in our payments, certain suppliers and subcontractors have imposed less favorable payment terms on us, including requirements to provide them with additional security in the form of prepayments, surety bonds or letters of credit. The imposition of burdensome payment terms or collateral requirements could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and our ability to make payments to other parties. This in turn could cause us to be unable to operate our business at the desired service levels, which might adversely affect our profitability and cash flow. In other cases, our relationships with certain third parties have been terminated, requiring us to rely on new firms for certain services, which may cost more and be of inferior quality.\nIn addition, changes in market and economic conditions could increase the risk of a lack of available suppliers or subcontractors. If any supplier or subcontractor upon which we rely is unable or unwilling to meet its obligations under present or future agreements with us, we may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain necessary services and may suffer an interruption in our ability to provide our services to customers.\nTo the extent we cannot engage quality subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials on acceptable terms, we would not be able to meet the full demands of our customers, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations.\nLegal matters could divert management\u2019s focus, result in substantial expenses, and have an adverse impact on our reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLawsuits and investigations involving us, or our current or former officers and directors, could result in significant expenses and divert attention and resources of our management and other key employees. We could be required to pay damages or other penalties or have injunctions or other equitable remedies imposed against us or our current or former directors and officers. In addition, we are generally obligated to indemnify our current and former directors and officers in connection with lawsuits, governmental investigations and related litigation or settlement amounts. Such amounts could exceed the coverage provided under our insurance policies. Any of these factors could harm our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nCompliance with environmental, health, safety and other related laws and regulations is costly, and our ongoing operations may expose us to related liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to the protection of the environment or human health and safety. We are subject to various U.S. federal statutes and the regulations implementing them, as well as similar laws and regulations at the state and local levels. Environmental laws and regulations are complex and subject to frequent change, and the new U.S. presidential administration is expected to revise existing environmental regulations and to pursue new initiatives. If we fail to comply with existing for future environmental laws or regulations, we may be subject to significant liabilities for fines, penalties, or damages, or lose or be denied significant operating permits. Changes in environmental laws and regulations could also increase our environmental compliance expenditures.\nIn addition, we may be subject to liability allegations involving claims of personal injury or property damage. The operation of complex, large-scale equipment used in a variety of locations and climates and integration of a variety of purchased components entails an inherent risk of disputes and liabilities related to the operation of the equipment and the health and safety of the workers who operate and come into contact with the machinery. Because our services are primarily provided in power plants, claims could arise in different contexts, including fires, explosions and power surges, which can result in significant property damage or personal injury, and equipment failure, which can result in personal injury or damage to other equipment in the power plant.\nThe insurance policies we maintain to cover claims of this nature are subject to deductibles and recovery limitations, as well as limitations on contingencies covered, and we may, therefore, suffer losses from these claims for which no insurance recovery is available. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside the U.S.\nWe currently provide services in Canada and may seek to further expand our services outside the U.S. in the future. We face risks doing business internationally that could materially and adversely affect our business, including: the imposition of trade barriers, currency exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls, longer payment cycles, greater difficulties in accounts receivables collection, difficulties in complying with a variety of foreign laws, changes in legal or regulatory requirements, the potential for shortages of trained labor, complex and uncertain employment environments, exposure to local economic and political conditions, the impact of social unrest, such as risks of terrorism or other hostilities, and potentially adverse tax consequences. To the extent we experience these risks, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected, and, as a result, we may determine to scale back or terminate our international operations.\nOur cross-border activities also subject us to certain regulatory matters, including import and export licenses, tariffs, Canadian and U.S. customs and tax issues and toxic substance certifications. Violations of these requirements could result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil, and criminal penalties. In addition, the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d) (in Canada, known as the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (\u201cCUSMA\u201d)), became effective July 2020 and superseded the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d). NAFTA provided protection against tariffs, duties and other charges or fees and assures access by the signatories. The impact of USMCA on energy markets is uncertain. Any of the foregoing factors may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur future business prospects in Canada are, in part, dependent upon the continued operation of Canadian nuclear plants and refurbishment of the majority of the plants in Ontario to extend their operating lives. Unfavorable economic conditions, competition from other forms of power generation, increased competition for refurbishment contracts, changes in government policy or operational or project execution issues may lead nuclear plant operators in Canada to cease operations or delay, curtail or cancel proposed or existing life-extension projects, which may decrease the overall demand for our services in Canada and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to effectively manage our growth, including our expansion into international markets.\nWe are subject to the risk that we may be unable to effectively manage our growth, which requires us to develop and improve our existing administrative and operational systems and our financial and management controls and further expand, train and manage our work force. As we continue this effort, we may incur substantial costs and expend substantial resources in connection with any such expansion due to different technology standards, legal considerations, and cultural differences. We may not be able to efficiently or effectively manage our current or future international operations and growth of such operations, compete effectively in such markets, or recruit top talent and train our personnel. Any failure to successfully manage our expansion may materially and adversely affect our business and future growth and may cause us to scale back or terminate such expansion efforts. In addition, acquisitions and other business transactions may disrupt or otherwise have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and any acquisitions of businesses and their respective assets also involve the risks that the businesses and assets acquired may prove to be less valuable than we expect and we may assume unknown or unexpected liabilities, costs and problems.\nLimitations or modifications to indemnification regulations of the U.S. or Canada could adversely affect our business.\nWe provide services to the nuclear industry. The Price-Anderson Act promotes the nuclear industry by offering broad indemnification to commercial nuclear power plant operators and U.S. Department of Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d) contractors for liabilities arising out of nuclear incidents at power plants licensed by the NRC and at DOE nuclear facilities. That indemnification protects not only the NRC licensee or DOE prime contractor, but also others like us who may be doing work under contract or subcontract for a licensed power plant or under a DOE prime contract. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended the period of coverage to include all nuclear power reactors issued construction permits through December 31, 2025.\nWe also provide nuclear fabrication and other services to the nuclear power industry in Canada. Canada\u2019s NLCA generally conforms to international conventions and is conceptually similar to the Price-Anderson Act in the U.S. Accordingly, indemnification protections and the possibility of exclusions under Canada\u2019s NLCA are similar to those under the Price-Anderson Act in the U.S.\nThe Price-Anderson Act and Canada\u2019s NLCA indemnification provisions may not apply to all liabilities that we might incur while performing services as a contractor for the DOE and the nuclear power industry. If an incident or evacuation is not covered under the Price-Anderson Act\u2019s or Canada\u2019s NLCA\u2019s indemnification provisions, we could be held liable for damages, regardless of fault, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if such indemnification authority is not applicable in the future, for instance, our business could be adversely affected if the owners and operators of nuclear power plants fail to retain our services in the absence of commercially adequate insurance and indemnification. In addition, any well-publicized problem with our nuclear industry services, whether actual or perceived, could adversely affect our reputation and reduce demand for our services.\nOur failure to attract and retain qualified personnel, skilled workers and key officers could have an adverse effect on us.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified professional and/or skilled personnel in accordance with our needs, either through direct hiring, subcontracting or acquisition of other firms employing such professionals, is an important factor in determining our future success. The market for these professionals is competitive, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain needed personnel. Our ability to successfully execute our business strategy depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified, experienced mechanical, design, structural and software engineers, service technicians and marketing and sales personnel. Demand for these workers can, at times, be high and the supply extremely limited. Our success is also highly dependent upon the continued services of our key officers, and we do not maintain key employee insurance on any of our executive officers.\nWe have experienced significant turnover in our senior management team and reductions in our workforce over the past few years and have promoted or hired new employees to fill certain key roles. If we are unable to retain qualified personnel, the roles and responsibilities of those employees will need to be filled, which may require that we devote time and resources to identifying, hiring, and integrating new employees. In addition, the failure to attract and retain key employees, including officers, could impair our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, sustain or expand our operations, provide services to our customers, and conduct our business effectively. Furthermore, if key employees do not meet the expectations of their roles, we could experience operational and administrative inefficiencies and added costs that could adversely impact our results of operations, our stock price and our customer relationships and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult.\nOur failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures in order to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. We previously determined that we had material weaknesses in our internal control environment and internal control activities; while we believe that we have remediated these material weaknesses, and continue to take meaningful steps to enhance our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting by strengthening our financial reporting and accounting functions, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. See \u201cPart II-Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\u201d\nBecause of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur undetected, and it is possible that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may be identified in the future. Any failure of our internal controls could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements, significant deficiencies, material weaknesses, costs, failure to timely meet our periodic reporting obligations and erosion of investor confidence. It would also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. If our internal controls are deemed inadequate in the future, our current external auditors could resign, and the process of retaining new auditors could limit our access to capital for an extended period of time.\nDemand for our services is cyclical and vulnerable to economic slowdowns and reductions in private industry and government spending. In times of general economic contraction, our revenue, profits, and financial condition may be adversely affected and will not necessarily rise in tandem with general economic expansion.\nThe industries we serve historically have been, and will likely continue to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to general slowdowns in the U.S. and Canadian economies. Consequently, our results of operations have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate depending on the level of demand for services from these industries.\nOur bookings and revenue may rise or fall sharply as total industry orders tend to follow pronounced cycles of general expansion and contraction. During a contraction phase, limited investment in new projects, deferrals of planned projects and project cancellations may significantly reduce our potential recognition of revenue and profits. At the end of an expansion phase, any existence of excess capacity will negatively affect power prices, which will result in a reduction in new orders. In addition to being cyclical in nature, our revenue does not correlate precisely with changes in actual or forecasted new capacity due to timing differences in revenue recognition.\nDuring periods of declining demand for power, many of our customers may face budget shortfalls or may delay capital expenditures, which could result in a decrease in the overall demand for our services. Our customers may find it more difficult to obtain project financing due to limitations on the availability of credit and other uncertainties in the global credit markets. In addition, our customers may demand better pricing terms and their ability to timely pay our invoices may be affected in times of economic slowdown. Any such reduction in private industry or government spending could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, net income, or overall financial condition.\nThe Company continues to monitor several factors that may cause our revenue, profits, and financial condition to differ from our historical results. For instance, in 2020, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused work delays on projects in New York due to specific state, local, municipal and customer mandated stay-at-home orders and new project requirements that were established to protect workers and the general public. Additionally, during 2020, the Company experienced a delay in a nuclear project and an outage cycle in Louisiana, and experienced a slowdown in business development activities and bid opportunities, particularly in Ontario, Canada due to COVID-19. While the Company has not experienced a materially negative impact when compared to previous years, necessary protocols will remain in place to adhere to the new challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic to keep our employees, partners, and customers safe, which may continue to affect our operations.\nIn addition, although federal and state governments have increased spending as part of efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, any recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic impact may also be slowed or reversed by a number of factors, including delayed deployment of vaccinations, or another widespread resurgence in COVID-19 infections. The COVID-19 pandemic created challenges during 2020 but our ability to adapt to uncertainty and quickly deploy our resources to overcome the unknown, has helped us to keep our employees safe and produce sustainable financial results.\nInformation technology vulnerabilities and cyberattacks on our networks could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely upon information technology to manage and conduct business, both internally and with our customers, suppliers and other third parties. Internet transactions involve the transmission and storage of data, including, in certain instances, customer and supplier business information. Accordingly, maintaining the security of our computers and other electronic devices, computer networks and data storage resources is a critical issue for us and our customers and suppliers because security breaches could result in reduced or lost ability to carry on our business and loss of and/or unauthorized access to confidential information. From time to time, we experience cyberattacks on our information technology systems, and those of our distributors, manufacturers, suppliers and other partners, whose systems we do not control. We have limited personnel and other resources to address information technology reliability and security of our computer networks and respond to known security incidents to minimize potential adverse impacts. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks. Experienced hackers, cybercriminals and perpetrators of threats may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These perpetrators of cyberattacks also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, malware, and other malicious software programs that attack our information and networks or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our information and networks. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until long after being launched against a target, so we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate preventative measures or remediate any intrusion on a timely or effective basis. Moreover, the development and maintenance of these preventative and detective measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. We, therefore, remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or as yet unknown threats, as in some instances, we, our distributors, manufacturers, suppliers, and other partners may be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. We also face the risk that we may expose our customers or partners to cyberattacks.\nA breach of our information technology systems and security measures as a result of third party action, malware, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations and expose us to customer, supplier and other third party liabilities, as well as result in disruptions to critical systems, theft of funds, data\nor intellectual property, corruption or loss of data and unauthorized release of proprietary, confidential or sensitive information of ours or our customers. Any damage, security breach, delay or loss of critical data associated with our systems may delay or prevent certain operations and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; in addition, such events could expose us to data and funds loss, disrupt our operations, allow others to unfairly compete with us and subject us to litigation, government enforcement actions, regulatory penalties and costly response measures. Any resulting negative publicity could also significantly harm our reputation. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional significant resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nOur failure to comply with applicable governmental privacy laws and regulations in the U.S. and Canada could substantially impact our business, operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive and evolving federal, state, and international privacy laws and regulations. Changes in privacy and data security laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations could have a negative effect on our operating methods and costs. Failure to comply with such regulations could result in the termination or loss of contracts, the imposition of contractual damages, private and government civil litigation, civil sanctions, damage to our reputation or, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, cash flows, business and prospects. Determining compliance with such regulations is complicated by the fact that many of these laws and regulations have not been fully interpreted by governing regulatory authorities or the courts, and many of the provisions of such laws and regulations are open to a range of interpretations. There can be no assurance that we are, or have been, in compliance with all applicable existing laws and regulations or that we will be able to comply with new laws or regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Privacy Rights Act.\nOur participation in multiemployer pension plans could adversely impact our liquidity and results of operations.\nDuring 2020, we contributed to approximately 75 multiemployer pension plans throughout the U.S. and, historically, we have contributed to over 150 multiemployer pension plans in which we may have withdrawal liabilities. We believe that our responsibility for potential withdrawal liabilities associated with participating in multiemployer pension plans is limited because the building and construction trades exemption pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 should apply to the substantial majority of our plan contributions. However, pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and other applicable laws, we are exposed to other potential liabilities associated with plans that are underfunded. As of December 31, 2020, we had been notified that certain pension plans were in critical funding status. Currently, certain plans are developing, or have developed, a rehabilitation plan that may call for a reduction in participant benefits or an increase in future employer contributions. Therefore, in the future, we could be responsible for potential surcharges, excise taxes and/or additional contributions related to these plans, which could impact our liquidity and results of operations. While we continue to actively monitor, assess and take steps to limit our potential exposure to any surcharges, excise taxes, additional contributions and/or withdrawal liabilities, any market conditions or the number of participating employers remaining in each plan may result in a reorganization, insolvency or mass withdrawal that could have a material adverse effect on the funded status of the multiemployer plans and our potential withdrawal liability.\nWe are subject to anti-bribery laws in the U.S. and Canada, and failure to comply with these laws could result in our becoming subject to penalties and the disruption of our business activities.\nWe are subject to laws in the U.S. and Canada that restrict the offer or payment of anything of value to government officials or other persons with the intent of gaining business or favorable government action. In addition to prohibiting certain bribery-related activity with U.S. and Canadian officials and other persons, these laws provide for recordkeeping and reporting obligations. Any failure by us, our subcontractors, agents or others who work for us on our behalf to comply with these legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties. The failure to comply with these legal and regulatory obligations could also result in the disruption of our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWork disruptions resulting from the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements or otherwise could result in increased operating costs and adversely affect our operating performance.\nThe majority of our temporary craft employees are represented by labor unions with which we have collective bargaining agreements. There can be no assurance that we will not experience labor disruptions associated with a lengthy strike or the expiration or renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements or other work stoppage at our facilities or customer locations, which could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Common Stock\nWe may not be able to maintain our NYSE American listing and may incur additional costs as a result of our NYSE American listing.\nOur common stock commenced trading on the NYSE American on February 22, 2021, and we are subject to certain NYSE American continued listing requirements and standards. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to satisfy the requirements of the NYSE American\u2019s continued listing standards. A delisting of our common stock could negatively affect the price and liquidity of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital in the future. In addition, we may incur costs that we have not previously incurred relating to compliance with the rules and requirements of the NYSE American.\nThe market price for our common stock has historically been volatile, and our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the purchase price paid.\nThe market price of our common stock has historically fluctuated significantly and may be affected by numerous factors (some of which are beyond our control), including:\n\u25cf The risk factors described in this Item 1A;\n\u25cf Actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;\n\u25cf Changes in laws or regulations and court rulings and trends in our industry;\n\u25cf The significant concentration of ownership of our common stock in the hands of a small number of investors;\n\u25cf Changes in supply and demand of components and materials;\n\u25cf Changes in tax or accounting standards affecting our industry;\n\u25cf A shortfall in operating revenue or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors;\n\u25cf Changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or the financial performance of our competitors or companies in our industry;\n\u25cf General conditions in our customers\u2019 industries; and\n\u25cf The degree of trading liquidity in our common stock, including our ability to remain listed on the NYSE American, and general market conditions, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDeclines in the price of our common stock could impede our ability to obtain additional capital and attract and retain qualified employees and could reduce the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, a reduction in our stock price increases the cost to us, in terms of dilution, of using our equity for employee compensation.\nThe stock markets have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of similarly situated companies, including, most recently, fluctuations relating to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not currently expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock, so investors may not receive any return on investment unless investors sell their shares of common stock for a price greater than that which investors paid for them.\nOn May 30, 2012, our Board adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we would pay quarterly dividends on our common stock; however, we have not paid any dividends since March 2015. In addition, each of the Term Loan and the PNC Facility prohibits us from paying cash dividends. Therefore, we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nAny future determination with respect to the payment of dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions, terms of financing arrangements and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. Future dividends, their timing and amount will be subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all of our respective laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends and may be affected by, among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for organic initiatives and strategic transactions; debt service requirements; our credit rating; changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws; limitations in our debt facilities; and changes to our business model. We cannot provide assurance that we will declare dividends of any\nparticular amounts or at all. If we do not pay dividends, then our common stock may be less valuable because a return on investment will occur only if our stock price increases, and such appreciation may not occur.\nWe are subject to anti-takeover effects of certain charter and bylaw provisions and Delaware law, as well as of our substantial insider ownership.\nProvisions of our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d), Fourth Amended and Restated By-Laws (the \u201cBy-Laws\u201d) and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management and Board. These provisions include providing our Board the ability to set the number of directors and to fill vacancies on the Board occurring between stockholder meetings.\nWe are also subject to provisions of the Delaware corporation law that, in general, prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of 15% or more of our common stock for three years following the date the beneficial owner acquired at least 15% of our stock, unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our Board. Together, these charter and statutory provisions could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures, as well as the significant amount of common stock beneficially owned by Wynnefield Capital, Inc. and its affiliates, the Company\u2019s largest equity investors (\u201cWynnefield\u201d), could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of us, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nWe may issue a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the future, and stockholders may be adversely affected by the issuance of those shares.\nWe may raise additional capital or refinance or restructure our debt by issuing shares of common stock, or other securities convertible into common stock, which would increase the number of shares of common stock outstanding and will result in potentially substantial dilution in the equity interest of our current stockholders and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. For instance, in March 2020, we issued 5,384,615 shares of our common stock in connection with the closing of our Rights Offering. We could seek to issue new debt, equity, and hybrid securities in the future. In addition, we have issued shares of our common stock pursuant to private placement exemptions from Securities Act registration requirements and may do so in the future in connection with financings, acquisitions, the settlement of litigation and other strategic transactions. We may also issue equity securities (including, but not limited to, warrants to purchase shares of our common stock) in connection with future financing transactions. The issuance, and the resale or potential resale, of shares of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could be dilutive to our stockholders.\nFuture sales of our common stock and any of our other efforts to raise additional capital may depress our stock price.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or otherwise, either by us, a member of management or a major stockholder, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity and debt offerings. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, investor ownership interest may be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect investor rights as a stockholder. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. Any of the above could cause a decline in our stock price.", "PERMNO": 88987, "SIC": 1600, "TIC": "WLMS"}
