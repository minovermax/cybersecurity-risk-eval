RISK FACTORS\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nWE HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN REVENUE AND INCURRED SIGNIFICANT OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014, HAVE NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL, NEGATIVE SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY AND ARE IN DEFAULT OF OUR SECURED LINE OF CREDIT RAISING SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN\nTotal revenues declined from $21.7 million in 2013 to $11.1 million in 2014 and $11.6 million in 2015. For the same years, we incurred net losses of $7.3 million, $6.2 million and $2.9 million, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2015 we had negative working capital of approximately $4.8 million and negative stockholders\u2019 equity of approximately $4.1 million. We are (and since July 2014 have been) in default under our line of credit and do not have sufficient funds to repay our lender. The lender has several remedies available to it including acceleration of outstanding borrowings and it is collateralized by substantially all of our assets. The outstanding balance on our line of credit at March 22, 2016 was approximately $3.3 million.\nOur business plan contemplates organic growth in revenues and through the addition of new products to our sales channel, including development of the Blood Volume Monitor, which could mitigate the decline in sales of our ZMI electrotherapy products since 2013. The factors described above may also negatively affect our ability to find, attract or retain sales personnel or qualified new employees and sales representatives and retain existing employees and sales representatives.\nWe require additional capital in the form of debt and/or equity to replace the line of credit and to provide additional working capital. Our history of operating losses and negative working capital may make it difficult to raise any new capital and may have an adverse impact on our relationship with third parties with whom we do business, including our customers, vendors and employees. We can offer no assurance that the bank will continue to forebear on exercising its rights under the loan documents, or that we will be able to acquire a sufficient amount of financing to meet our ongoing needs.\nThese conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWE ARE IN DEFAULT OF THE TERMS OF OUR LINE OF CREDIT AND ARE USING OUR REVENUE STREAM FOR OPERATIONS WITH THE CONSENT OF OUR LENDER\nWe are (and since July 2014 have been) in default under our line of credit and do not have sufficient funds to repay our lender. The lender has several remedies available to it including acceleration of outstanding borrowings and it is collateralized by substantially all of our assets. The outstanding balance of our line of credit at March 22, 2016 was $3,346. Although the lender has continued to make advances, there can be no assurance it will continue to do so. If the lender ceases to make advances, we will be unable to finance our business operations and general and administrative expenses, and this will likely result in our inability to continue operations. In addition, we have had to revise and extend the payment terms with many of our key supplier and vendors. If our key suppliers and vendors, many of whom now require payment in advance of delivery, cease doing business with us, it will have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWE MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL REQUIRED TO SUSTAIN OPERATIONS. WE MAY HAVE TO CURTAIL OUR BUSINESS IF WE CANNOT FIND ADEQUATE FUNDING\nOur ability to sustain operations is dependent on our ability to growth revenue and develop new products. This will require significant capital resources. We need to seek additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities to fund our business plan. We cannot be certain that we will be able to raise additional capital in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. If alternative sources of financing are insufficient or unavailable, we may be required to modify our business plan or significantly curtail our operations. Any additional equity financing may involve substantial dilution to our then existing stockholders. Any debt financing would require the approval of Triumph Healthcare Finance (\u201cTriumph\u201d or the \u201cLender\u201d), which is the Lender under our line of credit.\nOUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM HAS INCLUDED AN EXPLANATORY PARAGRAPH WITH RESPECT TO OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IN ITS REPORT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015\nIn their report dated March 31, 2016, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph raising substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and stated that our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 were prepared assuming that we would continue as a going concern. We have incurred significant losses in 2015, 2014 and 2013, and have limited liquidity. In addition, we are in default of our secured line of credit and as a result, if our lender insists upon immediate repayment, we will be insolvent and may be forced to seek protection from our creditors. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nCHANGES IN THE HEALTHCARE ENVIRONMENT MAY CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS\nSince 2013, we have encountered industry challenges related to health care reform, including the Affordable Care Act and coverage and reimbursement changes from government and Third-party payors, which has caused uncertainty to exist at the medical practitioner level causing a delay and decline in demand for our ZMI electrotherapy products. This significantly contributed to a significant decrease in revenues in 2015 and 2014 compared to revenues reported in prior years. The Affordable Care Act dramatically alters the United States health care system and is intended to decrease the number of uninsured Americans and reduce the overall cost of healthcare. The Affordable Care Act attempts to achieve these goals by, among other things, requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance, expanding Medicaid eligibility, reducing Medicare payments to providers, expanding the Medicare program\u2019s use of value-based purchasing programs and instituting certain private health insurance reforms. These factors have resulted in reimbursement changes for durable medical equipment, which has caused uncertainty to exist at the medical practitioner level causing a delay and decline in demand for our ZMI electrotherapy products. We also have experienced coverage and reimbursement challenges from government and Third-party payors related to certain medical indications for our ZMI electrotherapy products, all of which have negatively impacted our revenue and financial results for 2015 and 2014. This uncertainty has led to a decrease in orders for our products, which has been further exacerbated by departures of members of our external sales force.\nIt is difficult to predict the full impact of the Affordable Care Act because of its complexity, lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance, gradual and potentially delayed implementation, future potential legal challenges, and possible repeal and/or amendment, as well as the inability to foresee how individuals and businesses will respond to the choices afforded them by the Affordable Care Act. Further complicating predictions regarding the impact of the Affordable Care Act is uncertainty surrounding individual State\u2019s decisions to expand Medicaid, as contemplated by the Affordable Care Act, but made optional by the Supreme Court. The impact of health care reform has had a material adverse effect on our revenue and may continue to do so.\nWE ARE DEPENDENT ON REIMBURSEMENT FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES; CHANGES IN INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENT POLICIES OR APPLICATION OF THEM HAVE RESULTED IN DECREASED OR DELAYED REVENUES\nA large percentage of our revenues come from insurance company and government health care program reimbursement. Upon delivery of our products to our customers, we directly bill the customers\u2019 private insurance company or government payor for reimbursement. If the billed payors do not pay their bills on a timely basis or if they change their policies to exclude or reduce coverage for our products, we would experience a decline in our revenue as well as cash flow. In addition, we may deliver products to customers based on past practices and billing experiences with health insurance companies and have a health insurance company later deny coverage for such products.\nIn some cases our delivered product may not be covered pursuant to a policy statement of a health insurance provider, despite a payment history of the insurance provider and benefits to the patients. A health insurance provider may seek repayment of amounts previously paid for covered products. We maintain an allowance for provider discounts for amounts intended to cover legitimate requests for repayment. Failure to adequately identify and provide for amounts for resolution of repayment demands in our allowance for provider discounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. For government health care programs, if we identify a deficiency in prior claims or practices, we may be required to repay amounts previously reimbursed to us by government health care programs.\nWe frequently receive, and expect to continue to receive, refund requests from insurance providers relating to specific patients and dates of service. Billing and reimbursement disputes are very common in our industry. These requests are sometimes related to a few patients and other times include a significant number of refund claims in a single request. We review and evaluate these requests and determine if any refund is appropriate. We also review claims where we are rebilling or pursuing additional reimbursement from that insurance provider. We frequently have significant offsets against such refund requests which may result in amounts that are due to us in excess of the amounts of refunds requested by the insurance providers. Therefore, at the time of receipt of such refund requests we are generally unable to determine if a refund request is valid and should be accrued as a liability. Although we cannot predict whether or when a request for repayment or our subsequent request for reimbursement will be resolved, it is not unusual for such matters to be unresolved for a long period of time. No assurances can be given with respect to our estimates for our allowance for provider discounts for reimbursements and offsets or the ultimate outcome of the refund requests.\nFUTURE CHANGES IN COVERAGE AND REIMBURSEMENT POLICIES FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR REDUCTIONS IN REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR OUR PRODUCTS BY THRID PARTY PAYORS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn the United States, our products are prescribed by physicians for their patients. Based on the prescription, which we consider an order, we submit a claim for payment directly to third-party payors such as private commercial insurance carriers, government payors and others as appropriate and the payor reimburses us directly. Federal and state statutes, rules or other regulatory measures that restrict coverage of our products or reimbursement rates could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell or rent our products or cause physical therapists and physicians to dispense and prescribe alternative, lower-cost products.\nTHERE ARE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE, RELATED REFUND LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND PROVIDER DISCOUNTS THAT WE RECOGNIZE, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THESE AMOUNTS, IT COULD IMPACT THE TIMING OF OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION, HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR LEAD TO A RESTATEMENT OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\nThere are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenues, related refund liabilities, accounts receivable and provider discounts that we recognize in a reporting period. The billing and collection process is complex due to ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of coverage, differing provider discount rates and other third party payor issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our customers at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverage that occur each month, requires complex, resource-intensive processes. Errors in determining the correct coordination of benefits may result in refunds to payors. Revenues associated with government programs are also subject to estimating risk related to the amounts not paid by the primary government payor that will ultimately be collectable from other\ngovernment programs paying secondary coverage, the patient\u2019s commercial health plan secondary coverage or the patient. Collections, refunds and pay or retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after our products are provided. If our estimates of revenues, related refund liabilities, accounts receivable or provider discounts are materially inaccurate, it could impact the timing of our revenue recognition and have a significant impact on our operating results. It could also lead to a restatement of our financial results.\nOUR INVENTORY VALUATIONS MAY BE INCORRECT, WHICH MAY RESULT IN INVENTORY WRITE-DOWNS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe sell most of our medical devices through independent sales representatives and direct sales employees, utilizing a hybrid direct/independent contractor field sales model. Our field sales representatives are engaged to sell in predefined geographic markets and are compensated based on the actual payments received for valid orders obtained from our customers, which consist primarily of patients, health care providers, and dealers. Often times, we place a large amount of our inventory with field sales representatives to more quickly fill orders. A certain amount of such inventory may be retained by the sales representative or placed at doctor\u2019s offices or clinics for extended periods of time prior to its sale. If our inventory valuation is incorrect for any reason it may result in inventory write-downs that would increase costs and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. With the change to our EX Rx Prescription program, whereby orders are verified and shipped from our warehouse, consignment inventory of $1,256 was reserved for and written off during 2015.\nTHE PATIENT PROTECTION AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2010 HAS HAD AN IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS WHICH MAY BE IN PART BENEFICIAL AND IN PART DETRIMENTAL\nIn March 2010, broad federal health care reform legislation was enacted in the United States. This legislation did not become effective immediately in total, and may be modified prior to the effective date of some provisions. This legislation has had an impact on our business in a variety of ways including increased number of Medicaid recipients, increased number of individuals with commercial insurance, additional audits conducted by public health insurance plans such as Medicaid and Medicare, changes to the rules that govern employer group health insurance and other factors that influence the acquisition and use of health insurance from private and public payors. This legislation has resulted in a change in reimbursement for certain durable medical equipment. We believe the new healthcare legislation and these changes to reimbursement have caused uncertainty with prescribers, which we believe contributed to our drop in orders and revenue during 2014 and 2013 and the lack of any significant increase in 2015. We are currently unable to determine whether such trend will continue in future periods or whether the health care reform legislation will have other adverse consequences to our business and results of operations. To the extent prescribers write fewer prescriptions for our products or there is an adverse change to insurance reimbursement for our products, due to the new law or otherwise, our revenue and profitability will be materially adversely affected.\nEffective 2013, there was a 2.3% excise tax on the first sale of medical devices, with certain exceptions. We believe that a majority of our ZMI products are not subject to this tax but currently we can make no assurance. For our products that are or become subject to this excise tax, we are uncertain of our ability to pass this tax on to third parties. Thus far this excise tax has not had a material impact on our financial results.\nHOSPITALS AND CLINICIANS MAY NOT BUY, PRESCRIBE OR USE OUR PRODUCTS IN SUFFICIENT NUMBERS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN DECREASED REVENUES AND PROFITS\nHospitals and clinicians may not accept any of our products as effective, reliable, and cost-effective. Factors that could prevent such institutional customer acceptance include:\n\u25cf\nIf customers conclude that the costs of these products exceed the cost savings associated with the use of these products;\n\u25cf\nIf customers are financially unable to purchase these products;\n\u25cf\nIf adverse patient events occur with the use of these products, generating adverse publicity;\n\u25cf\nIf we lack adequate resources to provide sufficient education and training to our customers;\n\u25cf\nIf frequent product malfunctions occur, leading clinicians to believe that the products are unreliable;\n\u25cf\nUncertainty regarding or change in government or third party payor reimbursement policies for our products; and\n\u25cf\nIf physicians or other health care providers believe that our products will not be reimbursed by insurers or decide to prescribe competing products.\nBecause our sales are dependent on prescriptions from physicians, if any of these or other factors results in fewer prescriptions for our products being written, we will have reduced revenues and may not be able to fully fund operations. We experienced a steep decline in\norders for our ZMI products during 2015 and 2014 as compared to prior years, due to a drop in prescriptions, and can make no assurances that demand for our products will not further decline in future periods.\nANY NEW COMPETITOR COULD BE LARGER THAN WE AND HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES THAN WE DO AND THOSE ADVANTAGES COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO COMPETE WITH THEM\nMany competitors to our products used to have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources. Competition could result in our need to reduce prices, fewer orders, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share. Our products are regulated by the FDA. Competitors may develop products that are substantially equivalent to our FDA cleared products, thereby using our products as predicate devices to more quickly obtain FDA approval for their own. If overall demand for our products should decrease it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Substantial competition is expected in the future in the area of stroke rehabilitation that may directly compete with our NeuroMove product. These competitors may use standard or novel signal processing techniques to detect muscular movement and generate stimulation to such muscles. Other companies may develop rehabilitation products that perform better and/or are less expensive than our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, the electrotherapy industry experienced a significant development when our largest competitor, Empi announced their exit from the electrotherapy market immediately. Empi previously held a large share of the electrotherapy market. We believe this presents a significant growth opportunity for us. Through March 15, 2016, we have recruited over 70 former Empi sales reps, including those in areas where we had no previous representation. During 2016, our orders have been steadily increasing to approximately 2,800 in February 2016 as compared to an average of 1,000 during the first 11 months of 2015. To focus on growth and the potential future positive cash flow, we have committed our limited resources to the new salesforce, the supporting product production and supporting administrative (customer service and billing) personnel.\nFAILURE TO KEEP PACE WITH THE LATEST TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES COULD RESULT IN DECREASED REVENUES\nThe market for some of our products is characterized by rapid change and technological improvements. Failure to respond in a timely and cost-effective way to these technological developments could result in serious harm to our business and operating results. We have derived, and we expect to continue to derive, a substantial portion of our revenues from the development and sale of products in the medical device industry. As a result, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and market product offerings that respond in a timely manner to the technological advances of our competitors, evolving industry standards and changing patient preferences. There is no assurance that we will keep up with technological improvements.\nA THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURER\u2019S INABILITY TO PRODUCE OUR GOODS ON TIME AND TO OUR SPECIFICATIONS COULD RESULT IN LOST REVENUE\nThird-party manufacturers assemble and manufacture to our specifications components of the NexWave and NeuroMove and some of our other products. The inability of a manufacturer to ship orders of our products in a timely manner or to meet our quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items, which could result in cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries or a reduction in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Because of the timing and seriousness of our business, and the medical device industry in particular, the dates on which customers need and require shipments of products from us are critical. Further, because quality is a leading factor when customers, doctors, health insurance providers and distributors accept or reject goods, any decline in quality by our third-party manufacturers could be detrimental not only to a particular order, but also to our future relationship with that particular customer.\nIF WE NEED TO REPLACE MANUFACTURERS, OUR EXPENSES COULD INCREASE RESULTING IN SMALLER PROFIT MARGINS\nWe compete with other companies for the production capacity of our manufacturers and import quota capacity. Some of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, and thus have an advantage in the competition for production and import quota capacity. If we experience a significant increase in demand, or if we need to replace an existing manufacturer, we may have to expand our third-party manufacturing capacity. We cannot assure that this additional capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or similar to existing terms, which we have with our manufacturers, either from a production standpoint or a financial standpoint. We enter into a number of purchase order commitments specifying a time for delivery, method of payment, design and quality specifications and other standard industry provisions, but do not have long-term contracts with any manufacturer. None of the manufacturers we use produce our products exclusively.\nShould we be forced to replace one or more of our manufacturers, we may experience increased costs or an adverse operational impact due to delays in distribution and delivery of our products to our customers, which could cause us to lose customers or lose revenue because of late shipments.\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO RETAIN THE SERVICES OF MR. SANDGAARD OR IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY RECRUIT QUALIFIED MANAGERIAL AND SALES PERSONNEL WITH EXPERIENCE IN OUR BUSINESS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of Mr. Thomas Sandgaard, our Chief Executive Officer and Founder and beneficial owner of 55.7% of our outstanding stock. Loss of the services of Mr. Sandgaard could have a material adverse effect on our growth, revenues, and prospective business. There is currently no employment agreement with Mr. Sandgaard. We do not maintain key-man insurance on the life of Mr. Sandgaard. In addition, in order to successfully implement and manage our business plan, we will be dependent upon, among other things, successfully retaining and recruiting qualified managerial and sales personnel having experience in our business. Competition for qualified individuals is intense. Various factors, such as marketability of our products, our reputation, our liquidity, and sales commission structure can affect our ability to find, attract or retain sales personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to find, attract and retain qualified new employees and sales representatives and retain existing employees and sales representatives.\nWE NEED TO MAINTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE, WHICH COULD BECOME VERY EXPENSIVE OR HAVE LIMITED AVAILABILITY\nOur marketing and sale of medical device products and services creates an inherent risk of claims for product liability. As a result, we carry product liability insurance and will continue to maintain insurance in amounts we consider adequate to protect us from claims. We cannot, however, be assured that we have resources sufficient to satisfy liability claims in excess of policy limits if required to do so. Also, if we file liability claims, there is no assurance that our insurance provider will continue to insure us at current levels or that our insurance rates will not substantially rise in the future, resulting in increased costs to us or forcing us to either pay higher premiums or reduce our coverage amounts, which would result in increased liability to claims. In addition, we carry director and officer insurance.\nWE DEPEND UPON OBTAINING REGULATORY APPROVAL OF ANY NEW PRODUCTS AND/OR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS WE DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN APPROVALS OF CURRENT PRODUCTS; FAILURE TO OBTAIN OR MAINTAIN SUCH REGULATORY APPROVALS COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS, LOST REVENUE, PENALTIES AND FINES\nBefore marketing any new products, we will need to complete one or more clinical investigations of each product. There can be no assurance that the results of such clinical investigations will be favorable to us. We may not know the results of any study, favorable or unfavorable to us, until after the study has been completed. Such data must be submitted to the FDA as part of any regulatory filing seeking approval to market the product. Even if the results are favorable, the FDA may dispute the claims of safety, efficacy, or clinical utility and not allow the product to be marketed. The sale price of the product may not be enough to recoup the amount of our investment in conducting the investigative studies and we may expend significant funds on research and development on products that are rejected by the FDA. Some of our products are marketed based upon our interpretation of FDA regulation allowing for changes to an existing device. If our interpretations are incorrect, we could suffer consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows and could result in fines and penalties. There can be no assurance that we will have the financial resources to complete development of any new products or to complete the regulatory approval process.\nWE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN CLEARANCE OF A 510 (K) NOTIFICATION OR APPROVAL OF A DENOVO OR PRE-MARKET APPROVAL APPLICATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY PRODUCTS ON A TIMELY BASIS, IF AT ALL\nIf timely FDA clearance or approval of new products is not obtained, our business could be materially adversely affected. Clearance of a 510(k) notification or DeNovo application may also be required before marketing certain previously marketed products, which have been modified after they have been cleared. Should the FDA so require, the filing of a new 510(k) notification for the modification of the product may be required prior to marketing any modified devices.\nTo determine whether adequate compliance has been achieved, the FDA may inspect our facilities at any time. Such compliance can be difficult and costly to achieve and maintain. Our compliance status may change due to future changes in, or interpretations of, FDA regulations or other regulatory agencies. Such changes may result in the FDA withdrawing marketing clearance or requiring product recall. In addition, any changes or modifications to a device or its intended use may require us to reassess compliance with good manufacturing practices guidelines, potentially interrupting the marketing and sale of products. We may also fail to comply with complex FDA regulations due to their complexity or otherwise. Failure to comply with regulations could result in enforceable actions,\nincluding product seizures, product recalls, withdrawal of clearances or approvals, and civil and criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and reputation.\nWE CONTINUE TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSES AND INCUR LOSSES\nThe area of medical device research is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. Developments and advances in the medical industry by either competitors or other parties can affect our business in either a positive or negative manner. Developments and changes in technology that are favorable to us may significantly advance the potential of our research while developments and advances in research methods outside of the methods we are using may severely hinder, or halt completely our development.\nWe are a small company in terms of employees, technical and research resources and we lack liquidity. We expect to have research and development and sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. These amounts may be expended before any commensurate incremental revenue from these efforts may be obtained and may adversely affect our potential profits and we may lack the liquidity to pay for such expenditures. These factors may also hinder our ability to meet changes in the medical industry as rapidly or effectively as competitors with more resources.\nWE MAY BE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR TRADEMARKS, TRADE SECRETS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe consider our trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property an integral component of our success. We rely on trademark law and trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with employees, customers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property. Effective trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are available. We currently own no patents. We cannot be certain that we have taken adequate steps to protect our intellectual property, especially in countries where the laws may not protect our rights as fully as in the United States. In addition, if our third-party confidentiality agreements are breached there may not be an adequate remedy available to us. If our trade secrets become publicly known, we may lose competitive advantages.\nSUBSTANTIAL COSTS COULD BE INCURRED DEFENDING AGAINST CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT\nOther companies, including competitors, may obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would limit, interfere with, or otherwise circumscribe Zynex\u2019s ability to make, use, or sell products. Should there be a successful claim of infringement against us and if we could not license the alleged infringed technology, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. The validity and breadth of claims covered in medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. Any litigation claims against us, independent of their validity, may result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources with no assurance of success. Intellectual property claims could cause us to:\n\u25cf\nCease selling, incorporating, or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property:\n\u25cf\nObtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; and\n\u25cf\nRe-design Zynex\u2019s products excluding the infringed intellectual property, which may not be possible.\nOUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY RELIANCE ON SOLE SUPPLIERS\nNotwithstanding our current multiple supplier approach, in the future certain essential product components may be supplied by sole, or a limited group of, suppliers. Most of our products and components are purchased through purchase orders rather than through long term supply agreements and large volumes of inventory may not be maintained. There may be shortages and delays in obtaining certain product components. Disruption of the supply or inventory of components could result in a significant increase in the costs of these components or could result in an inability to meet the demand for our products. In addition, if a change in the manufacturer of a key component is required, qualification of a new supplier may result in delays and additional expenses in meeting customer demand for products. These factors could adversely affect our revenues and ability to retain our experienced sales force.\nOUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO RECALL EVEN AFTER RECEIVING FDA OR FOREIGN CLEARANCE OR APPROVAL, WHICH WOULD HARM OUR REPUTATION AND BUSINESS\nWe are subject to medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to the FDA or respective governmental authorities in other countries if our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. The FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacturing. A government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors\nor design defects, including defects in labeling. Any recall would divert managerial and financial resources and could harm our reputation with customers. We cannot assure you that we will not have product recalls in the future or that such recalls would not have a material adverse effect on our business. We have not undertaken any voluntary or involuntary recalls to date.\nOUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER OWNS A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN OUR VOTING STOCK AND IS OUR SOLE DIRECTOR AND INVESTORS WILL NOT HAVE ANY VOICE IN OUR MANAGEMENT\nOur President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chairman and sole Director, Thomas Sandgaard, beneficially owns approximately 55.7% of our outstanding common stock as of March 22, 2016. As a result, Mr. Sandgaard has the ability to control substantially all day to day operations of our company and all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including:\n\u25cf\nElection of our board of directors;\n\u25cf\nRemoval of any of our directors;\n\u25cf\nAmendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws;\n\u25cf\nApproval of significant corporate transactions, such as a sale, merger or liquidation of our Company; and\n\u25cf\nAdoption of measures that could delay or prevent a change in control or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us.\nMATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS\nWe are a small company with limited resources and only a single executive officer and director. As of December 31, 2015 we reported material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) as we do not currently have an independent audit committee overseeing our internal controls, or an independent member of our Board. In addition, we have a material weaknesses due to a lack of segregation of duties within our accounting and approval process. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected in a timely basis. While we are committed to improving our financial controls, our ability to do so is limited as a result of a lack of working capital and other capital resources to do so. If we do not remediate this weakness in the future, in addition to any impact on our stock price, it could also impact our ability to raise capital and could affect adversely our reputation, which collaterally could affect our ability to retain sales personnel and business relationships with insurance companies paying for our products and vendors.\nIn February 2016, we hired a Chief Operating Officer\nWhen we are financially able to, we intend to consider taking the following actions, subject to the availability of funds: (1) hire a full time Chief Financial Officer, who will also serve as Principal Financial Officer, (2) appoint outside independent directors to our Board of Directors and utilize an independent audit committee of the Board of Directors who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures (when funds and/or additional resources are available to us), and (3) retain and utilize an outside independent consulting firm to assist us with assessing and testing the effectiveness of our ICFR (when funds and/or additional resources are available to us). We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our ICFR on an ongoing basis, and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.\nWE MAY FAIL TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY, INTEGRITY AND SECURITY OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION\nWe possess and process sensitive customer information and Protected Health Information protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Affordability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d). While we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect that information, if our security procedures and controls were compromised, it could harm our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition and may increase the costs we incur to protect against such information security breaches, such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with health care privacy and consumer protection laws. A compromise of our privacy or security procedures could also subject us to liability under certain health care privacy laws applicable to us.\nEXPANSION OF OUR OPERATIONS AND SALES INTERNATIONALLY MAY SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH UNEXPECTED EVENTS\nA component of our growth strategy is to expand our operations and sales internationally. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully market, sell and deliver our products in foreign markets, or that we will be able to successfully expand our international operations. Global operations could cause us to be subject to unexpected, uncontrollable and rapidly changing risks,\nevents and circumstances. The following factors, among others, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u25cf\nfailure to properly comply with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign activities including, without limitation, product approval, healthcare and employment law requirements and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in managing foreign operations and attracting and retaining appropriate levels of senior management and staffing;\n\u25cf\nlonger cash collection cycles;\n\u25cf\nproper compliance with local tax laws which can be complex and may result in unintended adverse tax consequences;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in exchange rates that may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in U.S. dollars of the products we provide in foreign markets;\n\u25cf\nthe ability to efficiently repatriate cash to the United States and transfer cash between foreign jurisdictions; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in general economic conditions or political circumstances in countries where we operate.\nAs we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our global operations and reduce our global sales, adversely affecting our business and future financial performance.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nOUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE SUBJECT TO THE \u201cPENNY STOCK\u201d RULES OF THE SEC AND THE TRADING MARKET IN OUR SECURITIES IS LIMITED, WHICH MAKES TRANSACTIONS IN OUR STOCK CUMBERSOME AND MAY REDUCE THE VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IN OUR STOCK\nSince our common stock is not listed or quoted on any stock exchange and no other exemptions may apply, trading in our common stock on the OTC Markets may be subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules of the SEC. These rules require, among other things, that any broker engaging in a transaction in our securities provide its customers with a risk disclosure document, disclosure of market quotations, if any, disclosure of the compensation of the broker and its salespersons in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market values of our securities held in the customer\u2019s accounts. The brokers must provide bid and offer quotations and compensation information before making any purchase or sale of a penny stock and also provide this information in the customer\u2019s confirmation. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock.\nSALES OF SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF SHARES HELD BY MR. SANDGAARD, OR THE PROSPECT OF THESE SALES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nSales of significant amounts of shares held by Mr. Sandgaard, or the prospect of these sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a resolution in certain issues in his divorce, Mr. Sandgaard recently transferred 250,000 shares of common stock he owned to the former Mrs. Sandgaard, which shares will become tradeable by Ms. Sandgaard after complying with the legal requirements under Rule 144 and other guidance. Mr. Sandgaard\u2019s stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.\nBECAUSE WE HAVE NO PLANS TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK, INVESTORS MUST LOOK SOLELY TO STOCK APPRECIATION FOR A RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT IN US\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that the board of directors deems relevant.\nInvestors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nOUR EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS COULD EXPERIENCE FURTHER DILUTION IF WE ELECT TO RAISE EQUITY CAPITAL TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS\nDue to our current liquidity issues, we have to raise capital in the form of debt and/or equity to meet working capital needs. Such action will likely require that we issue equity (or debt) securities which would result in dilution to our existing stockholders. Although we will attempt to minimize the dilutive impact of any future capital-raising activities, we cannot offer any assurance that we will be able to do so. If we are successful in raising additional working capital, we may have to issue additional shares of our common stock at prices at a discount from the then-current market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 18418, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "ZYXI"}
