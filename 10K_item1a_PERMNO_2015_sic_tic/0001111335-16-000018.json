{"cik": "1111335", "company": "VISTEON CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those not presently known or that the Company believes to be immaterial, also may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Should any such risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have material adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nThe automotive industry is cyclical and significant declines in the production levels of the Company\u2019s major customers could reduce the Company\u2019s sales and harm its profitability.\nDemand for the Company\u2019s products is directly related to the automotive vehicle production of the Company\u2019s major customers. Automotive sales and production is cyclical and can be affected by general economic or industry conditions, labor relations issues, fuel prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives, trade agreements, the cost and availability of credit and other factors. Automotive industry conditions in North America and Europe have been and continue to be extremely challenging. In North America, the industry is characterized by significant overcapacity and fierce competition. In Europe, the market structure is more fragmented with significant overcapacity and declining sales. While Asia continues to grow, the rate of growth is expected to decline.\nThe discontinuation of, loss of business or lack of commercial success, with respect to a particular vehicle model for which the Company is a significant supplier could reduce the Company\u2019s sales and harm its profitability.\nAlthough the Company has purchase orders from many of its customers, these purchase orders generally provide for the supply of a customer\u2019s annual requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant, or in some cases, for the supply of a customer\u2019s requirements for the life of a particular vehicle model, rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products. In addition, it is possible that customers could elect to manufacture components internally that are currently produced by outside suppliers, such as the Company. The discontinuation of, the loss of business with respect to or a lack of commercial success of a particular vehicle model for which the Company is a significant supplier, could reduce the Company\u2019s sales and harm the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company is highly dependent on Ford Motor Company and decreases in such customers\u2019 vehicle production volumes would adversely affect the Company.\nFord is one of the Company\u2019s largest customers and accounted for 34% of sales in 2015, 41% of sales in 2014, and 52% of sales in 2013. Accordingly, any change in Ford's vehicle production volumes will have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s sales volume and profitability.\nThe Company's inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of new program launches could adversely affect its financial performance.\nIn connection with the award of new business, the Company often obligates itself to deliver new products and services that are subject to its customers\u2019 timing, performance and quality standards. Additionally, as a Tier 1 supplier, the Company must effectively coordinate the activities of numerous suppliers in order to launch programs successfully. Given the complexity of new program launches, especially involving new and innovative technologies, the Company may experience difficulties managing product quality, timeliness and associated costs. In addition, new program launches require a significant ramp up of costs; however, the sales related to these new programs generally are dependent upon the timing and success of the introduction of new vehicles by the Company's customers. The Company's inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of these new program launches could adversely affect its financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe Company must continue to develop, introduce and achieve market acceptance of new and enhanced products in order to grow its sales in the future.\nThe growth of the Company's business will be dependent on the demand for innovative automotive electronics products. In order to increase sales in current markets and gain entry into new markets, the Company must innovate to maintain and improve existing products, while successfully developing and introducing distinctive new and enhanced products that anticipate changing customer and consumer preferences and capitalize upon emerging technologies. However, the Company may experience difficulties that delay or prevent the development, introduction or market acceptance of its new or enhanced products. Furthermore, competitors may develop and introduce technologies that gain greater customer or consumer acceptance, which could adversely affect the future growth of the Company.\nEscalating price pressures from customers may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nDownward pricing pressures by automotive manufacturers is a characteristic of the automotive industry. Virtually all automakers have implemented aggressive price reduction initiatives and objectives each year with their suppliers, and such actions are expected to continue in the future. In addition, estimating such amounts is subject to risk and uncertainties because any price reductions are a result of negotiations and other factors. Accordingly, suppliers must be able to reduce their operating costs in order to maintain profitability. The Company has taken steps to reduce its operating costs and other actions to offset customer price reductions; however, price reductions have impacted the Company\u2019s sales and profit margins and are expected to continue to do so in the future. If the Company is unable to offset customer price reductions in the future through improved operating efficiencies, new manufacturing processes, sourcing alternatives and other cost reduction initiatives, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition will likely be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s substantial international operations make it vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries.\nAs a result of the Company\u2019s global presence, a significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, the Company has manufacturing and distribution facilities in many foreign\ncountries, including countries in Europe, Central and South America and Asia. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad, including:\n\u2022\nlocal economic conditions, expropriation and nationalization, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls;\n\u2022\nwithholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ninvestment restrictions or requirements;\n\u2022\nexport and import restrictions; and\n\u2022\nincreases in working capital requirements related to long supply chains.\nExpanding the Company\u2019s business in Asia and Europe and enhancing the Company\u2019s business relationships with Asian and European automotive manufacturers worldwide are important elements of the Company\u2019s long-term business strategy. In addition, the Company has invested significantly in joint ventures with other parties to conduct business in Russia, China and elsewhere in Asia. The Company\u2019s ability to repatriate funds from these joint ventures depends not only upon their uncertain cash flows and profits, but also upon the terms of particular agreements with the Company\u2019s joint venture partners and maintenance of the legal and political status quo. As a result, the Company\u2019s exposure to the risks described above is substantial. The likelihood of such occurrences and its potential effect on the Company vary from country to country and are unpredictable. However, any such occurrences could be harmful to the Company\u2019s business and the Company\u2019s profitability and financial condition.\nThe Company could be negatively impacted by the distress of its supplier or other shortages.\nIn an effort to manage and reduce the costs of purchased goods and services, the Company, like many suppliers and automakers, has been consolidating its supply base. In addition, certain materials and components used by the Company are in high demand but of limited availability. As a result, the Company is dependent on single or limited sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of its products. The Company selects its suppliers based on total value (including price, delivery and quality), taking into consideration production capacities and financial condition. However, there can be no assurance that strong demand, capacity limitations or other problems experienced by the Company\u2019s suppliers will not result in occasional shortages or delays in the supply of components. If the Company were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of its suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and could not procure the components from other sources, the Company would be unable to meet its production schedules for some of its key products or to ship such products to its customers in a timely fashion, which would adversely affect sales, margins, and customer relations. Furthermore, unfavorable economic or industry conditions could result in financial distress within the Company's supply base, thereby increasing the risk of supply disruption. Although market conditions generally have improved in recent years, uncertainty remains and another economic downturn or other unfavorable industry conditions in one or more of the regions in which the Company operates could cause a supply disruption and thereby adversely affect the Company's financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to significant foreign currency risks and foreign exchange exposure.\nAs a result of our global presence, a significant portion of the Company's revenues and expenses is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company is therefore subject to foreign currency risks and foreign exchange exposure. The Company's primary exposures are to the Euro, Japanese Yen, Thai Baht, Mexican Peso and Chinese Renminbi. While the Company employs financial instruments to hedge transactional foreign exchange exposure, including multi-year contracts, exchange rates are difficult to predict and such actions may not insulate us completely from those exposures. As a result, volatility in certain exchange rates could adversely impact our financial results and comparability of results from period to period. Notably, the strong dollar, central bank actions, falling oil prices, and a slowdown in China have introduced additional uncertainty into the currency markets.\nWork stoppages and similar events could significantly disrupt the Company\u2019s business.\nBecause the automotive industry relies heavily on just-in-time delivery of components during the assembly and manufacture of vehicles, a work stoppage at one or more of the Company\u2019s manufacturing and assembly facilities could have material adverse effects on the business. Similarly, if one or more of the Company\u2019s customers were to experience a work stoppage, that customer would likely halt or limit purchases of the Company\u2019s products, which could result in the shut down of the related manufacturing facilities. A significant disruption in the supply of a key component due to a work stoppage at one of the Company\u2019s suppliers or any other supplier could have the same consequences, and accordingly, have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results.\nPrivacy concerns relating to the Company's current or future products and services could damage its reputation and deter current and potential users from using them.\nThe Company may gain access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Concerns about the Company's practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage its reputation and adversely affect its operating results.\nFurthermore, regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. Complying with these various laws could cause the Company to incur substantial costs.\nVisteon\u2019s operations may be restricted by the terms of the Company\u2019s credit agreements.\nThe Company\u2019s credit agreements include standard restrictive covenants. These covenants could impair the Company\u2019s financing and operational flexibility and make it difficult to react to market conditions and satisfy ongoing capital needs and unanticipated cash requirements. Specifically, such covenants may restrict the ability and, if applicable, the ability of the subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur significant additional debt;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nlimit dividends or other certain payments by restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nuse assets as security in other transactions;\n\u2022\npay dividends on common stock or repurchase equity interests other than those expressly permitted;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022\nguarantee the debts of others;\n\u2022\nenter into new lines of business; and\n\u2022\nform joint ventures or make subsidiary investments.\nIn addition, the credit agreements require the Company to periodically meet various financial ratios and tests which include a financial net leverage covenant, as well as certain maximum net leverage levels in order to take certain corporate actions such as incur additional debt or make restricted payments in excess of those expressly permitted, or for excess cash flow mandatory prepayments. These financial covenants and tests could limit the ability to react to market conditions or satisfy extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict the Company\u2019s financing and operations. The Company\u2019s ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of the credit agreements will depend on future operating performance. If the Company fails to comply with such covenants and terms, the Company would be required to obtain waivers from the lenders to maintain compliance under such agreements. If the Company is unable to obtain any necessary waivers and the debt under the credit agreements is accelerated, it could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and future operating performance.\nInflation may adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability and the profitability of the Company\u2019s tier 2 and tier 3 supply base.\nThe automotive supply industry has experienced significant inflationary pressures, primarily in ferrous and non-ferrous metals and petroleum-based commodities, such as resins. These inflationary pressures have placed significant operational and financial burdens on automotive suppliers at all levels, and are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Generally, it has been difficult to pass on, in total, the increased costs of raw materials and components used in the manufacture of the Company\u2019s products to its customers. In addition, the Company\u2019s need to maintain a continuing supply of raw materials and/or components has made it difficult to resist price increases and surcharges imposed by its suppliers.\nThe Company\u2019s pension expense and funding levels of pension plans could materially deteriorate or the Company may be unable to generate sufficient excess cash flow to meet increased pension benefit obligations.\nMany of the Company\u2019s employees participate in defined benefit pension plans or retirement/termination indemnity plans. Effective December 31, 2011, active salaried employees in the U.S. ceased to accrue benefits under the existing defined benefit pension plan. The Company\u2019s worldwide pension obligations exposed the Company to approximately $256 million in unfunded liabilities as of December 31, 2015, of which approximately $199 million and $57 million was attributable to unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. pension obligations, respectively.\nThe Company has previously experienced declines in interest rates and pension asset values. Future declines in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plans, or certain other changes, could materially deteriorate the funded status of the Company\u2019s plans and affect the level and timing of required contributions in 2016 and beyond. Additionally, a material deterioration in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase pension expenses and reduce the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s assumptions used to calculate pension obligations as of the annual measurement date directly impact the expense to be recognized in future periods. While the Company\u2019s management believes that these assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the Company\u2019s pension obligations and future expense. For more information on sensitivities to changing assumptions, please see Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Note 14 \u201cEmployee Retirement Benefits\u201d to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to generate sufficient cash to satisfy its obligations may be impacted by the factors discussed herein.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to effectively operate could be hindered if it fails to attract and retain key personnel.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to operate its business and implement its strategies effectively depends, in part, on the efforts of its executive officers and other key employees. In addition, the Company\u2019s future success will depend on, among other factors, the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, particularly engineers and other employees with critical expertise and skills that support key customers and products or in emerging regions. The loss of the services of any key employees or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company may incur significant restructuring charges.\nThe Company has taken, and expects to take, restructuring actions to realign and resize its production capacity and cost structure to meet current and projected operational and market requirements. Charges related to these actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Moreover, there can be no assurances that any future restructurings will be completed as planned or achieve the desired results.\nImpairment charges relating to the Company\u2019s goodwill and long-lived assets and possible increases to deferred income tax asset valuation allowances could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nThe Company regularly monitors its goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment indicators. The Company performs either a qualitative or quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis. In conducting the impairment analysis of long-lived assets, the Company compares the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets to the related net book values. Changes in economic or operating conditions impacting the estimates and assumptions could result in the impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets. In the event that the Company determines that its goodwill or long-lived assets are impaired, the Company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings that could materially affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition in the period(s) recognized. The Company recorded asset impairment charges including discontinued operations of $5 million and $190 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, to adjust the carrying value of certain assets to their estimated fair value. In addition, the Company cannot provide assurance that it will be able to recover remaining net deferred tax assets, which are dependent upon achieving future taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions. Failure to achieve its taxable income targets may change the Company\u2019s assessment of the recoverability of its remaining net deferred tax assets and would likely result in an increase in the valuation allowance in the applicable period. Any increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense, which could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s future results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s expected annual effective tax rate could be volatile and could materially change as a result of changes in mix of earnings and other factors.\nChanges in the Company\u2019s debt and capital structure, among other items, may impact its effective tax rate. The Company\u2019s overall effective tax rate is computed as consolidated tax expense as a percentage of consolidated earnings before tax. However, tax expenses and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional basis. Further, the Company is in a position whereby losses incurred in certain tax jurisdictions generally provide no current financial statement benefit. In addition, certain jurisdictions have statutory rates greater than or less than the United States statutory rate. As such, changes in the mix and source of earnings between jurisdictions could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s overall effective tax rate in future periods. Changes in tax law and rates, changes in rules related to accounting for income taxes or adverse outcomes from tax audits that\nregularly are in process in any of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates could also have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s overall effective rate in future periods.\nWarranty claims, product liability claims and product recalls could harm the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company faces the inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that its products fail to perform as expected or such failure results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury or property damage (or both). In addition, if any of the Company\u2019s designed products are defective or are alleged to be defective, the Company may be required to participate in a recall campaign. As suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions, automakers are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to suppliers for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls. A successful warranty or product liability claim against the Company in excess of its available insurance coverage and established reserves, or a requirement that the Company participate in a product recall campaign, could have materially adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is involved from time to time in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes, which could have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company is involved in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes that, from time to time, are significant. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes (including disputes with suppliers), intellectual property matters, personal injury claims and employment matters. No assurances can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s profitability and financial position.\nThe Company could be adversely impacted by environmental laws and regulations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to U.S. and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing emissions to air; discharges to water; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials; and the cleanup of contaminated properties. Currently, environmental costs with respect to former, existing or subsequently acquired operations are not material, but there is no assurance that the Company will not be adversely impacted by such costs, liabilities or claims in the future either under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future.\nDevelopments or assertions by or against the Company relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact its business.\nThe Company owns significant intellectual property, including a number of patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and is involved in numerous licensing arrangements. The Company\u2019s intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining its competitive position in a number of the markets served. Developments or assertions by or against the Company relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact the Company\u2019s business. Significant technological developments by others also could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations and financial condition.\nA disruption in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nWe rely on the accuracy, capacity and security of our information technology systems. Despite the security and risk-prevention measures we have implemented, our systems could be breached, damaged or otherwise interrupted by computer viruses, unauthorized physical or electronic access or other natural or man-made incidents or disasters. Such a breach or interruption could result in business disruption, theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets and unauthorized access to personnel information. To the extent that our business is interrupted or data is lost, destroyed or inappropriately used or disclosed, such disruptions could adversely affect our competitive position, relationships with our customers, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe Company may not be able to fully utilize its U.S. net operating losses and other tax attributes.\nVisteon's emergence from bankruptcy in 2010 resulted in a change of ownership within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) Sections 382 and 383, causing the use of Visteon's pre-emergence U.S. federal net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) and various other tax attributes to be limited in the post-emergence period. However, NOLs and other tax attributes generated in the post-emergence period are generally not limited by the emergence from bankruptcy, but could be limited if there is a subsequent change of ownership. If the Company were to have another change of ownership within the meaning of IRC Sections 382 and 383, its post-emergence NOL and other tax attributes could be limited to an amount equal to its market capitalization at the time of the\nsubsequent ownership change multiplied by the federal long-term tax exempt rate. The Company cannot provide any assurance that such an ownership change will not occur, in which case the availability of the Company's NOLs and other tax attributes could be significantly limited or possibly eliminated.\nCertain tax benefit preservation provisions of our corporate documents could delay or prevent a change of control, even if that change would be beneficial to stockholders.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that any attempted transfer of the Company's securities during a Restricted Period shall be prohibited and void ab initio insofar as it purports to transfer ownership or rights in respect of such stock to the purported transferee to the extent that, as a result of such transfer, either any person or group of persons shall become a \u201cFive-percent shareholder\u201d of Visteon pursuant to Treasury Regulation \u00a7 1.382-2T(g), other than a \u201cdirect public group\u201d as defined in such regulation (a \u201cFive-Percent Shareholder\u201d), or the percentage stock ownership interest in Visteon of any Five-Percent Shareholder shall be increased.\nThe foregoing restriction does not apply to transfers if either the transferor or transferee gives written notice to the Board of Directors and obtains their approval. A Restricted Period means any period beginning when the Company's market capitalization falls below $1.5 billion (or such other level determined by the Board of Directors not more frequently than annually) and ending when such market capitalization has been above such threshold for 30 consecutive calendar days.\nThese restrictions could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of an ownership change with respect to Visteon by (i) discouraging any person or group from being a Five-Percent Shareholder and (ii) discouraging any existing Five-Percent Shareholder from acquiring more than a minimal number of additional shares of Visteon's stock.\nThe Company\u2019s business and results of operations could be affected adversely by terrorism.\nTerrorist-sponsored attacks, both foreign and domestic, could have adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. These attacks could accelerate or exacerbate other automotive industry risks such as those described above and also have the potential to interfere with the Company\u2019s business by disrupting supply chains and the delivery of products to customers.\nA failure of the Company\u2019s internal controls could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to report its financial condition and results of operations accurately and on a timely basis. As a result, the Company\u2019s business, operating results and liquidity could be harmed.\nBecause of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud, even an effective system of internal control may not prevent or detect all misstatements. In the event of an internal control failure, the Company\u2019s ability to report its financial results on a timely and accurate basis could be adversely impacted, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in its financial reports or have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to operate its business or access sources of liquidity.", "PERMNO": 88319, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "VC"}
