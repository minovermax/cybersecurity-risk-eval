{"cik": "1612720", "company": "NextDecade Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are subject to uncertainties and risks due to the nature of the business activities we conduct. The following information describes certain uncertainties and risks that could affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or expectations contained in our forward-looking statements on page 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section does not describe all risks applicable to us, our industry or our business, and it is intended only as a summary of known material risks that are specific to us. We may experience additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are in the process of developing LNG liquefaction and export projects, and the success of such projects is unpredictable; as such, positive cash flows and even revenues will be several years away, if they occur at all.\nWe are not expected to generate cash flow, or even obtain revenues, unless and until the Terminal is operational, which is expected to be at least three years away, and accordingly, distributions to investors may be limited, delayed, or non-existent.\nOur cash flow and consequently our ability to distribute earnings is solely dependent upon the revenue Rio Grande receives from the Terminal and the transfer of funds by Rio Grande to NextDecade in the form of distributions or otherwise. Rio Grande\u2019s ability to complete the Terminal, as discussed further below, will be dependent upon, among other things, our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and raise the capital necessary to fund development of the Terminal.\nOur ability to pay dividends is almost entirely dependent upon our ability to complete the Terminal and generate cash and net operating income from operations. We do not expect to generate any revenue until the completion of construction of the first phase of the Terminal. Upon such completion, financing and numerous other factors affecting the Terminal may reduce our cash flow. As a result, we may not make distributions of any amount or any distributions may be delayed.\nSubstantially all of our anticipated revenue will be dependent upon the Terminal. Due to our lack of asset diversification, adverse developments at or affecting the Terminal would have a significantly greater impact on our financial condition and results of operations than if we maintained a more diverse portfolio of assets.\nWe will be required to seek additional debt and equity financing in the future to complete the Terminal and may not be able to secure such financing on acceptable terms, or at all.\nSince we will be unable to generate any revenue while we are in the development and construction stages for multiple years, we will need additional financing to provide the capital required to execute our business plan. We will need significant funding to develop and construct the Terminal as well as for working capital requirements and other operating and general corporate purposes.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient capital on acceptable terms, or at all. If sufficient capital is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate the development of business opportunities, and our operations and financial condition may be adversely affected to a significant extent.\nDebt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include liens on Terminal assets and covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as paying dividends or making distributions, incurring additional debt, acquiring or disposing of assets and increasing expenses. Debt financing would also be required to be repaid regardless of our operating results.\nIn addition, the ability to obtain financing for the Terminal is expected to be contingent upon, among other things, our ability to enter into sufficient long-term commercial agreements prior to the commencement of construction. For additional information regarding our ability to enter into sufficient long-term commercial agreements, see \u201c- Our ability to generate cash is substantially dependent upon us entering into satisfactory contracts with third parties and the performance of those third parties under those contracts.\u201d\nPostponement in making a positive FID in the construction and operation of the Terminal may require us to amend some of our agreements.\nThe terms of certain agreements to which we are a party require that a positive FID in the Terminal occur no later than specified dates or may otherwise terminate at the end of their respective terms. If we postpone making a positive FID in the construction and operation of the Terminal beyond any such date or term, we may need to amend the corresponding agreement in order to extend such date or term. Our business could be materially adversely affected if certain of such agreements are not amended.\nThe Terminal\u2019s operations will be substantially dependent on the development and operation of the Pipeline by Enbridge, Inc. and its affiliates.\nThe Terminal will be dependent on a pipeline owned by an affiliate of Enbridge, Inc. (the \u201cTransporter\u201d) for the delivery of all of its natural gas. The Pipeline is currently in development and its construction will require the Transporter to secure options for rights-of-way along the approximately 137-mile proposed Pipeline route. It is possible that, in negotiating to secure these rights-of-way, the Transporter encounters recalcitrant landowners or competitive projects, which could result in additional time needed to secure the Pipeline route and, consequently, delays in, or abandonment of, its construction. Construction of the Pipeline could be delayed or abandoned for any of many other reasons, such as it becoming economically disadvantageous to the Transporter, a failure to obtain or maintain necessary permits for construction or operation, mechanical or structural failures, inadvertent damages during construction, or any terrorist attack, including cyberterrorism, affecting the Pipeline or the Transporter. Any such delays in the construction of the Pipeline could delay the development of the Terminal and its becoming operational.\nWe may be subject to risks related to doing business in, and having counterparties based in, foreign countries.\nWe may engage in operations or make substantial commitments to and investments in, and enter into agreements with, counterparties located outside the U.S., which would expose us to political, governmental and economic instability and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nAny disruption caused by these factors could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects. Risks associated with potential operations, commitments and investments outside of the U.S. include but are not limited to risks of:\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange restrictions and currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nwar or terrorist attack;\n\u2022\nexpropriation or nationalization of assets;\n\u2022\nrenegotiation or nullification of existing contracts or international trade arrangements;\n\u2022\nchanging political conditions;\n\u2022\nmacro-economic conditions impacting key markets and sources of supply;\n\u2022\nchanging laws and policies affecting trade, taxation, financial regulation, immigration, and investment;\n\u2022\nthe implementation of tariffs by the U.S. or foreign countries in which we do business;\n\u2022\nduplicative taxation by different governments;\n\u2022\ngeneral hazards associated with the assertion of sovereignty over areas in which operations are conducted, transactions occur, or counterparties are located; and\n\u2022\nthe unexpected credit rating downgrade of countries in which our LNG customers are based.\nAs our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, any operations conducted outside the U.S. or transactions denominated in foreign currencies would face additional risks of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange. In addition, we would be subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and exchange rate changes on our financial reports when translating our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses from operations or transactions outside of the U.S. into U.S. dollars at the then-applicable exchange rates. These translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period.\nCosts for the Terminal are subject to various factors.\nConstruction costs for the Terminal will be subject to various factors such as economic and market conditions, government policy, claims and litigation risk, competition, the final terms of any definitive agreement for services with our EPC service provider, change orders, delays in construction, legal and regulatory requirements, unanticipated regulatory delays, site issues, increased component and material costs, escalation of labor costs, labor disputes, increased spending to maintain our construction schedule and other factors. In particular, costs for the Terminal are expected to be substantially affected by:\n\u2022\nglobal prices of nickel, steel, concrete, pipe, aluminum and other component parts of the Terminal and the contractual terms upon which our contractors are able to source and procure required materials;\n\u2022\nany U.S. import tariffs or quotas on steel, aluminum, pipe or other component parts of the Terminal, which may raise the prices of certain materials used in the Terminal;\n\u2022\ncommodity and consumer prices (principally, natural gas, crude oil and fuels that compete with them in our target markets) on which our economic assumptions are based;\n\u2022\nthe exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar with other currencies;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory regimes in the U.S. and the countries to which we will be authorized to sell LNG;\n\u2022\nlevels of competition in the U.S. and worldwide;\n\u2022\nchanges in the tax regimes in the countries to which we sell LNG or in which we operate;\n\u2022\ncost inflation relating to the personnel, materials and equipment used in our operations;\n\u2022\ndelays caused by events of force majeure or unforeseeable climatic events;\n\u2022\ninterest rates; and\n\u2022\nsynergy benefits associated with the development of multiple phases of the Terminal using identical design and construction philosophies.\nIn addition to our willingness to make a FID and our ability to construct the Terminal and achieve operations, events related to such activities may cause actual costs of the Terminal to vary from the range, combination and timing of assumptions used for projected costs of the Terminal. Such variations may be material and adverse, and an investor may lose all or a portion of its investment.\nThe construction and operation of the Terminal remains subject to further governmental approvals, and some approvals may be subject to further conditions, review and/or revocation and other legal and regulatory risks, which may result in delays, increased costs or decreased cash flows.\nWe are required to obtain governmental approvals and authorizations to implement our proposed business strategy, which includes the design, construction and operation of the Terminal and the export of LNG from the U.S. to foreign countries. As described above under \u201cBusiness\u2212 Governmental Permits, Approvals and Authorizations,\u201d the design, construction and operation of LNG export terminals is a highly regulated activity in the U.S., subject to a number of permitting requirements, regulatory approvals and ongoing safety and operational compliance programs. There is no guarantee that we will obtain or, if obtained, maintain these governmental authorizations, approvals and permits. Failure to obtain, or failure to obtain on a timely basis, or failure to maintain any of these governmental authorizations, approvals and permits could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nAuthorizations obtained from the FERC, the DOE and other federal and state regulatory agencies also contain ongoing conditions, and additional approval and permit requirements may be imposed. We do not know whether or when any such approvals or permits can be obtained, or whether any existing or potential interventions or other actions by third parties will interfere with our ability to obtain and maintain such permits or approvals. If we are unable to obtain and maintain the necessary approvals and permits, including as a result of untimely notices or filings, we may not be able to recover our investment in the Terminal. Additionally, government disruptions, such as a U.S. government shutdown, may delay or halt our ability to obtain and maintain necessary approvals and permits. There is no assurance that we will obtain and maintain these governmental permits, approvals and authorizations, or that we will be able to obtain them on a timely basis, and failure to obtain and maintain any of these permits, approvals or authorizations could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nIn addition, some of these governmental authorizations, approvals and permits require extensive environmental review. Some groups have perceived, and other groups could perceive, that the proposed construction and operation of the Terminal or the Galveston Bay Terminal could negatively impact the environment or cultural heritage sites. Objections from such groups could cause delays, damage to reputation and difficulties in obtaining governmental authorizations, approvals or permits or prevent the obtaining of such authorizations, approvals or permits altogether. Although the necessary authorizations, approvals and permits to construct and operate the Terminal and the Galveston Bay Terminal may be obtained, such authorizations, approvals and permits may be subject to ongoing conditions imposed by regulatory agencies or may be subject to legal proceedings not involving us, which is customary for U.S. LNG projects.\nThe Terminal and the Galveston Bay Terminal will be subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs, and existing and future environmental and similar laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs, liabilities or additional operating restrictions.\nOur business will be subject to extensive federal, state and local regulations and laws, including regulations and restrictions on discharges and releases to the air, land and water and the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes in connection with the development, construction and operation of its liquefaction facilities. These regulations and laws will require us to maintain permits, provide governmental authorities with access to its facilities for inspection and provide reports related to its compliance. Violation of these laws and regulations could lead to substantial fines and penalties or to capital expenditures related to pollution control or remediation equipment that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects. Federal and state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the lawfulness of the original conduct, for the release of certain types or quantities of hazardous substances into the environment. As the owner and operator of the Terminal and the Galveston Bay Terminal, we could be liable for the costs of cleaning up hazardous substances released into the environment and for damage to natural resources.\nIn addition, future federal, state and local legislation and regulations, such as regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions and the transportation of LNG may impose unforeseen burdens and increased costs on our business that could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. As an international shipper of LNG, our operations could also be impacted by environmental laws applicable under international treaties or foreign jurisdictions.\nChanges in legislation and regulations or interpretations thereof, such as those relating to the importation and exportation of LNG, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects and could cause additional expenditures and delays in connection with the proposed LNG facilities and their construction.\nThe laws, rules and regulations applicable to our business, including federal agencies\u2019 interpretations of and policies under such laws rules and regulations, are subject to change, either through new or modified regulations enacted on the federal, state or local level or by a change in policy of the agencies charged with enforcing such regulations. For example, the provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 that codified the FERC\u2019s policy of not regulating the terms and conditions of service for LNG import or export facilities expired in 2015. Although the FERC has not indicated that it intends to depart from this policy, there can be no assurance it will not do so in the future. The nature and extent of any changes in these laws, rules, regulations and policies may be unpredictable and may have material effects on our business. Future legislation and regulations or changes in existing legislation and regulations, or interpretations thereof, such as those relating to the liquefaction, storage, or regasification of LNG, or its transportation, could cause additional expenditures, restrictions and delays in connection with our operations as well as other future projects, the extent of which cannot be predicted and which may require us to limit substantially, delay or cease operations in some circumstances. Revised, reinterpreted or additional laws and regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating costs and restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business, the ability to expand our business, including into new markets, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.\nWe will be dependent on third-party contractors for the successful completion of the Terminal, and these contractors may be unable to complete the Terminal or may build a non-conforming Terminal.\nThe construction of the Terminal is expected to take several years, will be confined to a limited geographic area and could be subject to delays, cost overruns, labor disputes and other factors that could adversely affect financial performance or impair our ability to execute our scheduled business plan.\nTimely and cost-effective completion of the Terminal in conformity with agreed-upon specifications will be highly dependent upon the performance of third-party contractors pursuant to their agreements. However, we have not yet entered into definitive agreements with certain of the contractors, advisors and consultants necessary for the development and construction of the Terminal. We may not be able to successfully enter into such construction contracts on terms or at prices that are acceptable to us.\nFurther, faulty construction that does not conform to our design and quality standards may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. For example, improper equipment installation may lead to a shortened life of our equipment, increased operations and maintenance costs or a reduced availability or production capacity of the affected facility. The ability of our third-party contractors to perform successfully under any agreements to be entered into is dependent on a number of factors, including force majeure events and such contractors\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022\ndesign, engineer and receive critical components and equipment necessary for the Terminal to operate in accordance with specifications and address any start-up and operational issues that may arise in connection with the commencement of commercial operations;\n\u2022\nattract, develop and retain skilled personnel and engage and retain third-party subcontractors, and address any labor issues that may arise;\n\u2022\npost required construction bonds and comply with the terms thereof, and maintain their own financial condition, including adequate working capital;\n\u2022\nadhere to any warranties the contractors provide in their EPC contracts; and\n\u2022\nrespond to difficulties such as equipment failure, delivery delays, schedule changes and failure to perform by subcontractors, some of which are beyond their control, and manage the construction process generally, including engaging and retaining third-party contractors, coordinating with other contractors and regulatory agencies and dealing with inclement weather conditions.\nFurthermore, we may have disagreements with our third-party contractors about different elements of the construction process, which could lead to the assertion of rights and remedies under the related contracts, resulting in a contractor\u2019s unwillingness to perform further work on the relevant project. We may also face difficulties in commissioning a newly constructed facility. Any of the foregoing issues or significant project delays in the development or construction of the Terminal could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOur ability to generate cash is substantially dependent upon us entering into satisfactory contracts with third parties and the performance of those third parties under those contracts.\nWe have not yet entered into, and may never be able to enter into, satisfactory commercial arrangements with third-party suppliers of feedstock or other required supplies to the Terminal, or customers for products and services from the Terminal.\nOur business strategy regarding how and when the Terminal\u2019s export capacity or LNG produced by the Terminal is marketed may change based on market factors. Without limitation, our business strategy may change due to inability to enter into agreements with customers or based on our or market participants\u2019 views regarding future supply and demand of LNG, prices, available worldwide natural gas liquefaction capacity or regasification capacity or other factors. If efforts to market the Terminal\u2019s export capacity or LNG produced by the Terminal are not successful, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur construction and operations activities will be subject to a number of development risks, operational hazards, regulatory approvals and other risks which may not be fully covered by insurance, and which could cause cost overruns and delays that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.\nSiting, development and construction of the Terminal will be subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any construction project resulting from numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\ndifficulties or delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, sufficient debt or equity financing on reasonable terms;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain all necessary government and third-party permits, approvals and licenses for the construction and operation of any of the proposed LNG facilities;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain sale and purchase agreements that generate sufficient revenue to support the financing and construction of the Terminal;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in engaging qualified contractors necessary to the construction of the contemplated Terminal or other LNG facilities;\n\u2022\nshortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters and catastrophes, such as hurricanes, explosions, fires, floods, industrial accidents and terrorism;\n\u2022\ndelays in the delivery of ordered materials;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages and labor disputes;\n\u2022\ncompetition with other domestic and international LNG export terminals;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in domestic and international market demand for and supply of natural gas and LNG, which will depend in part on supplies of and prices for alternative energy sources and the discovery of new sources of natural resources;\n\u2022\nunexpected or unanticipated additional improvements; and\n\u2022\nadverse general economic conditions.\nDelays beyond the estimated development periods, as well as cost overruns, could increase the cost of completion beyond the amounts that are currently estimated, which could require us to obtain additional sources of financing to fund the activities until the Terminal is constructed and operational, which could cause further delays. The need for additional financing may also make the Terminal uneconomic. Any delay in completion of the Terminal may also cause a delay in the receipt of revenues projected from the Terminal or cause a loss of one or more customers. As a result, any significant construction delay, whatever the cause, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.\nOur operations will be subject to all of the hazards inherent in the receipt and processing of natural gas to LNG, and associated short-term storage including:\n\u2022\ndamage to pipelines and plants, related equipment, loading terminal, and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires and other natural disasters, acts of terrorism and acts of third parties;\n\u2022\ndamage from subsurface and/or waterway activity (for example, sedimentation of shipping channel access);\n\u2022\nleaks of natural gas, natural gas liquids, or oil or losses of natural gas, natural gas liquid, or oil as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities;\n\u2022\nfires, ruptures and explosions;\n\u2022\nother hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution and suspension of operations; and\n\u2022\nhazards experienced by other operators that may affect our operations by instigating increased regulations and oversight.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial loss to us as a result of claims for:\n\u2022\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u2022\ndamage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022\npollution and other environmental damage;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspension of our operations;\n\u2022\nfailure to perform contractual obligations; and\n\u2022\nrepair and remediation costs.\nDue to the scale of the Terminal, we may encounter capacity limits in insurance markets, thereby limiting our ability to economically obtain insurance with our desired level of coverage limits and terms. We may elect not to obtain insurance for any or all of these risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, contractual liabilities and pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience increased labor costs, and the unavailability of skilled workers or our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect us. In addition, changes in our senior management or other key personnel could affect our business operations.\nWe are dependent upon the available labor pool of skilled employees authorized to work in the U.S. We compete with other energy companies and other employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the technical skills and experience required to construct and operate our facilities and pipelines and to provide our customers with the highest quality service. A shortage in the labor pool of skilled workers able to legally work in the U.S. or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and could require an increase in the wage and benefits packages that we offer, thereby increasing our operating costs. Any increase in our operating costs could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nWe depend on our executive officers for various activities. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our personnel. Although we have arrangements relating to compensation and benefits with certain of our executive officers, we do not have any employment contracts or other agreements with key personnel binding them to provide services for any particular term. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nTechnological innovation, competition or other factors may negatively impact our anticipated competitive advantage or our processes.\nOur success will depend on our ability to create and maintain a competitive position in the natural gas liquefaction industry. We do not have any exclusive rights to any of the technologies that we will be utilizing. In addition, the technology we anticipate using in the Terminal may face competition due to the technological advances of other companies or solutions, including more efficient and cost-effective processes or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors or others, which could affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.\nFailure of exported LNG to be a competitive source of energy for international markets could adversely affect our customers and could materially and adversely affect our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nOperations of the Terminal will be dependent upon our ability to deliver LNG supplies from the U.S., which is primarily dependent upon LNG being a competitive source of energy internationally. The success of our business plan is dependent, in part, on the extent to which LNG can, for significant periods and in significant volumes, be supplied from North America and delivered to international markets at a lower cost than the cost of alternative energy sources. Through the use of improved exploration technologies, additional sources of natural gas may be discovered outside the U.S., which could increase the available supply of natural gas outside the U.S. and could result in natural gas in those markets being available at a lower cost than that of LNG exported to those markets.\nAdditionally, our liquefaction projects will be subject to the risk of LNG price competition at times when we need to replace any existing LNG sale and purchase contract, whether due to natural expiration, default or otherwise, or enter into new LNG sale and purchase contracts. Factors relating to competition may prevent us from entering into a new or replacement LNG sale and purchase contract on economically comparable terms as prior LNG sale and purchase contracts, or at all. Factors which may negatively affect potential demand for LNG from our liquefaction projects are diverse and include, among others:\n\u2022\nincreases in worldwide LNG production capacity and availability of LNG for market supply;\n\u2022\ndecreases in demand for LNG or increases in demand for LNG, but at levels below those required to maintain current price equilibrium with respect to supply;\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of natural gas feedstock supplied to any project;\n\u2022\ndecreases in the cost of competing sources of natural gas or alternate sources of energy such as coal, heavy fuel oil, diesel, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar;\n\u2022\ndecrease in the price of non-U.S. LNG, including decreases in price as a result of contracts indexed to lower oil prices;\n\u2022\nincreases in capacity and utilization of nuclear power and related facilities;\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of LNG shipping; and\n\u2022\ndisplacement of LNG by pipeline natural gas or alternate fuels in locations where access to these energy sources is not currently available.\nPolitical instability in foreign countries that import natural gas, or strained relations between such countries and the U.S. may also impede the willingness or ability of LNG suppliers, purchasers and merchants in such countries to import LNG from the U.S. Furthermore, some foreign purchasers of LNG may have economic or other reasons to obtain their LNG from non-U.S. markets or our competitors\u2019 liquefaction facilities in the U.S.\nAs a result of these and other factors, LNG may not be a competitive source of energy internationally. The failure of LNG to be a competitive supply alternative to local natural gas, oil and other alternative energy sources in markets accessible to our customers could adversely affect the ability of our customers to deliver LNG from the U.S. on a commercial basis. Any significant impediment to the ability to deliver LNG from the U.S. generally or from the Terminal specifically could have a material adverse effect on our customers and our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nDecreases in the global demand for and price of natural gas (versus the price of imported LNG) could lead to reduced development of LNG projects worldwide.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the development, operation and financing of domestic LNG facilities. The development of domestic LNG facilities and projects is generally based on assumptions about the future price of natural gas and LNG and the conditions of the global natural gas and LNG markets. Natural gas and LNG prices have been, and are likely to remain in the future, volatile and subject to wide fluctuations that are difficult to predict. As a result, our activities will expose us to risks of commodity price movements, which we believe could be mitigated by entering into long-term LNG sales contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in entering into long-term LNG sales contracts. Additionally, the global LNG market could shift toward the use of shorter-term LNG sales contracts.\nFluctuations in commodity prices may create a mismatch between natural gas and petroleum prices, which could have a significant impact on our future revenues. Commodity prices and volumes are volatile due to many factors over which we have no control, including competing liquefaction capacity in North America; the international supply and receiving capacity of LNG; LNG marine transportation capacity; weather conditions affecting production or transportation of LNG from the Terminal; domestic and global demand for natural gas; the effect of government regulation on the production, transportation and sale of natural gas; oil and natural gas exploration and production activities; and the development of and changes in the cost of alternative energy sources for natural gas and political and economic conditions worldwide.\nOur activities are also dependent on the price and availability of materials for the construction of the Terminal, such as nickel, aluminum, pipe, and steel, which may be subject to import tariffs in the U.S. market and are all also subject to factors affecting commodity prices and volumes. In addition, authorities with jurisdiction over wholesale power rates in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere, as well as independent system operators overseeing some of these markets, may impose price limitations, bidding rules and other mechanisms which may adversely impact or otherwise limit trading margins and lead to diminished opportunities for gain. We cannot predict the impact energy trading may have on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nFurther, the development of liquefaction facilities takes a substantial amount of time, requires significant capital investment, may be delayed by unforeseen and uncontrollable factors and is dependent on our financial viability and ability to market LNG internationally.\nCompetition in the LNG industry is intense, and some of our competitors have greater financial, technological and other resources.\nWe plan to operate in the highly competitive area of LNG production and face intense competition from independent, technology-driven companies as well as from both major and other independent oil and natural gas companies and utilities.\nMany competing companies have secured access to, or are pursuing development or acquisition of, LNG facilities in North America. We may face competition from major energy companies and others in pursuing our proposed business strategy to provide liquefaction and export products and services at the Terminal. In addition, competitors have and are developing LNG terminals in other markets, which will compete with U.S. LNG facilities. Some of these competitors have longer operating histories, more development experience, greater name recognition, superior tax incentives, more employees and substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we currently possess. The superior resources that some of these competitors have available for deployment could allow them to compete successfully against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.\nThere may be shortages of LNG vessels worldwide, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.\nThe construction and delivery of LNG vessels requires significant capital and long construction lead times, and the availability of the vessels could be delayed to the detriment of our business and customers due to the following:\n\u2022\nan inadequate number of shipyards constructing LNG vessels and a backlog of orders at these shipyards;\n\u2022\npolitical or economic disturbances in the countries where the vessels are being constructed;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or maritime self-regulatory organizations;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages or other labor disturbances at the shipyards;\n\u2022\nbankruptcies or other financial crises of shipbuilders;\n\u2022\nquality or engineering problems;\n\u2022\nweather interference or catastrophic events, such as a major earthquake, tsunami, or fire; or\n\u2022\nshortages of or delays in the receipt of necessary construction materials.\nWe will rely on third-party engineers to estimate the future capacity ratings and performance capabilities of the Terminal, and these estimates may prove to be inaccurate.\nWe will rely on third parties for the design and engineering services underlying our estimates of the future capacity ratings and performance capabilities of the Terminal. Any of our LNG facilities, when constructed, may not have the capacity ratings and performance capabilities that we intend or estimate. Failure of any of our facilities to achieve our intended capacity ratings and performance capabilities could prevent us from achieving the commercial start dates under our future LNG sale and purchase agreements and could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nTerrorist attacks, including cyberterrorism, or military campaigns involving us or the Terminal could result in delays in, or cancellation of, construction or closure of the Project.\nA terrorist or military incident involving the Terminal may result in delays in, or cancellation of, construction of the Terminal, which would increase our costs and prevent us from obtaining expected cash flows. A terrorist incident could also result in temporary or permanent closure of the Terminal, which could increase costs and decrease cash flows, depending on the duration of the closure. Operations at the Terminal could also become subject to increased governmental scrutiny that may result in additional security measures at a significant incremental cost. In addition, the threat of terrorism and the impact of military campaigns may lead to continued volatility in prices for natural gas that could adversely affect our business and customers, including the ability of our suppliers or customers to satisfy their respective obligations under our commercial agreements. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, including cyberterrorism, or war could also materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital. The continuation of these developments may subject our construction and operations to increased risks, as well as increased costs, and, depending on their ultimate magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nThe operation of the Terminal may be subject to significant operating hazards and uninsured risks, one or more of which may create significant liabilities and losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.\nThe plan of operations for the Terminal is subject to the inherent risks associated with LNG operations, including explosions, pollution, release of toxic substances, fires, hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions, and other hazards, each of which could result in significant delays in commencement or interruptions of operations and/or result in damage to or destruction of the Terminal and assets or damage to persons and property.\nWe do not, nor do we intend to, maintain insurance against all these risks and losses. We may not be able to maintain desired or required insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of customers for the purchase of LNG.\nThe number of potential customers is limited. Some potential purchasers of the LNG to be produced from the Terminal are new to the LNG business and have limited experience in the industry. We will be reliant upon the ability of these customers to enter into satisfactory downstream arrangements in their home markets for the licenses to import and sell re-gasified LNG. Some of these jurisdictions are heavily regulated and dominated by state entities. In certain instances, customers may require credit enhancement measures in order to satisfy project-financing requirements.\nOur U.S. competitors have acquired significant property tax incentives, and we may not be able to acquire or may not have acquired similar incentives from applicable taxing entities.\nDue to the size of the Terminal\u2019s capital investment, property taxes represent large operating costs for the Terminal. The principal taxing entities are the Point Isabel Independent School District (\u201cPIISD\u201d) and Cameron County (the \u201cCounty\u201d). Due to local opposition supported by national environmental interest groups, PIISD did not initially accept our application for a value limitation agreement pursuant to the State of Texas tax code provisions for economic development. We intend to resubmit the application for consideration, but there is no guaranty that it will be accepted and approved. Approval of these tax incentives is an important component of the Terminal\u2019s competitiveness. Failure to gain approval of tax incentives by PIISD and other applicable tax authorities on comparable terms with competitors could materially impact the Terminal\u2019s competitiveness.\nOn October 3, 2017, we executed four tax abatement agreements with the County; however, there is no assurance that the terms of such tax abatement agreements are competitive with other Gulf Coast liquefaction projects.\nObjections from local communities can delay the Terminal.\nSome local communities could perceive the proposed construction and operation of the Terminal as negatively impacting the environment, wildlife, cultural heritage sites or the public health of residents. Objections from local communities could cause delays, limit access to or increase the cost of construction capital, cause reputational damage and impede us in obtaining or renewing permits.\nThe Terminal will be dependent on the availability of gas supply at the Agua Dulce supply area.\nThe Pipeline is expected to collect and transport natural gas to the Terminal. The proposed Pipeline route passes through Jim Wells, Kleberg, Kenedy, Willacy, and Cameron Counties in Texas. The header system at the upstream end of the Pipeline is intended to have multiple interconnects to the existing natural gas pipeline grid located in the Agua Dulce supply area (the \u201cAgua Dulce Hub\u201d). The Agua Dulce Hub includes deliveries from, but not limited to, ConocoPhillip\u2019s 1,100-mile South Texas intrastate and gas gathering pipeline system and ExxonMobil\u2019s 925 MMcf/d King Ranch processing facility. As the Pipeline system interconnects are expected to be relatively close to the Agua Dulce Hub, it is expected that gas will be available for purchase in large volumes at commercially acceptable prices. Nonetheless, disruptions in upstream supply sources or increased market demand could impact the availability of gas supply to the Pipeline header system, which would result in curtailments at the Terminal.\nEach liquefaction train for the Terminal is expected to involve the transportation and liquefaction of approximately 0.75 Bcf/day of natural gas, for a total of 4.5 Bcf/day for six liquefaction trains at full build-out. Gas sales agreements for the supply of these volumes could entail negotiations with multiple parties for firm and interruptible gas supply and transportation services to the Pipeline header system, as well as pipeline interconnects and ancillary operational agreements in time for operational start-up as early as 2023. Delays caused by third parties in the course of negotiating agreements and constructing the required interconnects could delay the start of commercial operations for the Terminal.\nUnethical conduct and non-compliance with applicable laws could have a significant adverse effect on our business.\nIncidents of unethical behavior, fraudulent activity, corruption or non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations could be damaging to our operations and reputation and may subject us to criminal and civil penalties or loss of operating licenses. We have implemented an anti-corruption policy which applies to all employees and contractors without exception and we are a member of TRACE International, an internationally recognized anti-bribery compliance organization. Our legal team screens potential partners, agents and advisors in multiple databases to which it has access and regularly conducts due diligence interviews with potential counterparties. Due to the global nature of the LNG business and the diversity of jurisdictions in which our customers operate, it is possible that a prospective counterparty could be accused of behavior that falls short of our expectations in this regard, leading to reputational damage and potential legal liabilities, notwithstanding our best efforts to prevent such behaviors.\nOur common stock could be delisted from Nasdaq.\nOur common stock is currently listed on Nasdaq. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq. If we fail to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq, our common stock may become subject to delisting. If Nasdaq delists our common stock from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the continued listing standards, we and our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences including:\n\u2022\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u2022\na limited amount of analyst coverage; and\n\u2022\na decreased ability for us to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future. Holders of our common stock could lose all or part of their investment.\nThe securities markets in general and our common stock have experienced significant price and volume volatility. The market price and trading volume of our common stock may continue to experience significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations, business prospects or those of companies in our industry. In addition to the other risk factors discussed in this section, the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by:\n\u2022\ndomestic and worldwide supply of and demand for natural gas and corresponding fluctuations in the price of natural gas;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our quarterly or annual financial results or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nissuance of additional equity securities which causes further dilution to stockholders;\n\u2022\nsales of a high volume of shares of our common stock by our stockholders;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nevents affecting other companies that the market deems comparable to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulation or proposals applicable to us;\n\u2022\nactual or potential non-performance by any customer or a counterparty under any agreement;\n\u2022\nannouncements made by us or our competitors of significant contracts;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock or changes in financial or other estimates by analysts.\nThe stock prices of companies in the LNG industry have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. Following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation often has been initiated against a company. If any class action litigation is initiated against us, we may incur substantial costs and our management\u2019s attention may be diverted from our operations, which could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights. Additionally, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other securities in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe may seek the additional capital necessary to fund our operations through public or private equity offerings and debt financings. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, existing stockholders\u2019 ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect their rights as a stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. In addition, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other securities in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation grants our board of directors the power to designate and issue additional shares of common and/or preferred stock.\nOur authorized capital consists of 480,000,000 shares of common stock and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Our preferred stock may be designated into series pursuant to authority granted by our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d), and on approval from our board of directors. 166,364 shares of preferred stock have been designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d), and 166,364 shares of preferred stock have been designated as Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the \u201cSeries B Preferred Stock\u201d and together with the Series A Preferred Stock, the \u201cConvertible Preferred Stock\u201d), in each case which are convertible into shares of common stock upon the occurrence of certain events. The board of directors, without any action by our stockholders, may designate and issue additional shares of preferred stock in such classes or series as it deems appropriate and establish the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares, including dividends, liquidation and voting rights. The rights of holders of other classes or series of stock that may be issued could be superior to the rights of holders of our common stock. The designation and issuance of shares of capital stock having preferential rights could adversely affect other rights appurtenant to shares of our common stock.\nThe dividend, liquidation, and redemption rights of the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock may adversely affect our financial position and the rights of the holders of our common stock.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had 58,197 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 55,645 shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding. The shares of Convertible Preferred Stock bear dividends at a rate of 12% per annum, which are cumulative and accrue daily from the date of issuance on the $1,000 stated value. Such dividends are payable quarterly and may be paid in cash or in-kind. No dividends may be paid to holders of our common stock while accumulated dividends remain unpaid on the Convertible Preferred Stock.\nFurther, we are required, on the earlier of (i) ten (10) business days following a FID Event (as defined in the certificates of designations of the Convertible Preferred Stock) and (ii) the date that is the tenth (10th) anniversary of the closings of the issuances of the Convertible Preferred Stock, as applicable, to convert all of the Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of Company common stock at a strike price of $7.34 per share of Company common stock. The conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock would directly dilute the holders of our common stock. In the event we are liquidated while shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are outstanding, holders of Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive a preferred liquidation distribution, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends, before holders of our common stock receive any distributions.\nHolders of the Convertible Preferred Stock have certain voting and other rights that may adversely affect holders of our common stock, and the holders of Convertible Preferred Stock may have different interests from and vote their shares in a manner deemed adverse to, holders of our common stock.\nThe holders of Convertible Preferred Stock vote on an \u201cas-converted\u201d basis with the holders of our common stock on all matters brought before the holders of our common stock. In addition, prior to the conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock, the consent of the holders of at least a majority of each of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding, in each case voting together as a single class, will be required for the Company to take certain actions, including, among others, (i) authorizing, creating or approving the issuance of any shares, or of any security convertible into, or convertible or exchangeable for shares of, senior to the Convertible Preferred Stock; (ii) authorizing, creating or approving the issuance of any shares of, or of any security convertible into, or convertible or exchangeable for shares of, Parity Stock (as defined in the certificates of designations of the Convertible Preferred Stock), subject to certain exceptions; (iii) adversely affecting the rights, preferences or privileges of the Convertible Preferred Stock, as applicable, subject to certain exceptions; (iv) amending, altering or repealing any of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation in a manner that would adversely affect the powers, designations, preferences or rights of the Convertible Preferred Stock, as applicable; or (v) amending, altering or repealing any of the provisions of the certificates of designations of the Convertible Preferred Stock, as applicable.\nThe holders of Convertible Preferred Stock may have different interests from the holders of our common stock and could vote their shares in a manner deemed adverse to the holders of our common stock.\nExercise of warrants may have a dilutive effect on our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2019, outstanding IPO Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 12,081,895 shares of our common stock were exercisable in accordance with the terms of the warrant agreement governing such warrants. These warrants will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York time, on July 24, 2022 or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The exercise price of these warrants is $11.50 per one full share of our common stock, subject to certain adjustments.\nIn addition, we issued warrants together with the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock. The warrants issued together with the Series A Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries A Warrants\u201d) represent the right to acquire in the aggregate a number of shares of common stock equal to approximately 71 basis points (0.71%) of all outstanding shares of Company common stock, measured on a fully diluted basis, on the exercise date with a strike price of $0.01 per share. The warrants issued together with the Series B Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries B Warrants\u201d and, together with the Series A Warrants, the \u201cCommon Stock Warrants\u201d) represent the right to acquire in the aggregate a number of shares of common stock equal to approximately 71 basis points (0.71%) of all outstanding shares of Company common stock, measured on a fully diluted basis, on the exercise date with a strike price of $0.01 per share.\nThe Common Stock Warrants have a fixed three-year term commencing on the closings of the issuances of the associated Convertible Preferred Stock. The Common Stock Warrants may only be exercised by holders of the Common Stock Warrants at the expiration of such three-year term, except that the Company can force the exercise of the Common Stock Warrants prior to expiration of such term if the volume weighted average trading price of shares of common stock for each trading day during any 60 of the prior 90 trading days is equal to or greater than 175% of the conversion price of the applicable Convertible Preferred Stock and, with respect to the Series B Warrants, the Company simultaneously elects to force a mandatory exercise of all other warrants then outstanding and un-exercised and held by any holder of parity stock.\nTo the extent the IPO Warrants are exercised, or the warrants issued together with the Convertible Preferred Stock are exercised, additional shares of our common stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the holders of our common stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market or the fact that such warrants may be exercised could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our charter documents or Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent us from being acquired even if being acquired would be beneficial to our stockholders and could make it more difficult to change management.\nProvisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the \u201cBylaws\u201d) may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders might otherwise consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempt by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult to replace or remove our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions include:\n\u2022\nelimination of our stockholders\u2019 ability to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nelimination of our stockholders\u2019 ability to act by written consent;\n\u2022\nan advance notice requirement for stockholder proposals and nominations for members of our board of directors;\n\u2022\na classified board of directors, the members of which serve staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nthe express authority of our board of directors to make, alter or repeal the Bylaws;\n\u2022\nthe authority of our board of directors to determine the number of director seats on our board of directors; and\n\u2022\nthe authority of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as it may determine.\nIn addition, the Certificate of Incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for any claims, including (i) any derivative actions or proceedings brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or any wrongdoing by, a director, officer or employee or (iii) any action asserting a claim pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, (iv) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws or (v) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision that is contained in the Certificate of Incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 15293, "SIC": 4923, "TIC": "NEXT"}
