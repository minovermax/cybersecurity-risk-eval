{"cik": "1673985", "company": "AdvanSix Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nAll statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Form 10-K including, without limitation, statements under \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and in other parts of this report regarding our financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. When used in this Form 10-K, words such as \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cintend\u201d and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our management, identify forward looking statements. Such forward looking statements are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. They are not guarantees of future performance and actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. All subsequent written or oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular, the factors discussed below. These factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider all of the information in this Form 10-K and each of the risks described below, which we believe are the principal risks that we face. Some of the risks relate to our business, others to the Spin-Off. Some risks relate principally to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock.\nAny of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Form 10-K.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nDifficult and volatile conditions in the overall economy, particularly in the United States but also globally, and in the capital, credit and commodities markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by difficult global economic conditions and significant volatility in the capital, credit and commodities markets and in the overall economy. Difficult and volatile conditions in the United States and globally could affect our business in a number of ways. For example:\n\u2022 Weak economic conditions, especially in our key markets, could reduce demand for our products, impacting our sales and margins;\n\u2022 As a result of the recent volatility in commodity prices, we may encounter difficulty in achieving sustained market acceptance of past or future price increases;\n\u2022 Under difficult market conditions, there can be no assurance that access to credit or the capital markets would be available or sufficient, and in such a case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on reasonable terms, or at all; and\n\u2022 Market conditions could result in our key customers experiencing financial difficulties and/or electing to limit spending, which in turn could result in decreased sales and earnings for us.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive and experiences cyclicality which can cause significant fluctuations in our cash flows. These industry dynamics may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive. Competition in the nylon resin industry is based on a number of factors such as price, product quality and service. We face significant competition from major international and regional competitors. Our competitors may improve their competitive position in our core markets by successfully introducing new products or innovations in their manufacturing processes or improving their cost structures. If we are unable to keep pace with our competitors\u2019 product and manufacturing process innovations or cost position improvements, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur historical operating results reflect the cyclical and sometimes volatile nature of the caprolactam, Nylon 6 resin and ammonium sulfate industries. We experience cycles of fluctuating supply and demand for each of the products we sell which result in changes in selling prices. Periods of high demand, tight supply and increasing operating margins tend to result in increases in capacity and production until supply exceeds demand, generally followed by periods of oversupply and declining prices. For example, the global market for Nylon 6 resin and caprolactam has undergone significant change in the past five years as Chinese manufacturers have entered the market and increased global supply at a time when demand has remained relatively stable, causing a decline in price and product margins. As a result of the increased capacity and competitive intensity, the margins for Nylon 6 resin and caprolactam have declined in recent years to historic lows. Decreases in the average selling prices of our products could have an adverse effect on our profitability. While we strive to maintain or increase our profitability by reducing costs through improving production efficiency, emphasizing higher margin products and by controlling transportation, selling and administration expense, we cannot assure you that these efforts will be sufficient to offset fully the effect of possible decreases in pricing on operating results. Because of the cyclical nature of our businesses, we cannot assure you that pricing or profitability in the future will be comparable to any particular historical period, including the most recent period shown in our operating results.\nMoreover, historically, information about our business and operations was presented as part of the broader Honeywell corporate organization. As an independent, publicly-traded company, we are required to publicly provide more detailed information about our business and operations, including financial information and material contract terms. This information will be accessible to our customers, suppliers and competitors, each of whom may factor the new information into their commercial dealings with us or the markets in which we operate. The use of such information by third parties in the marketplace could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny significant unplanned downtime or material disruption at one of our production facilities or logistics operations may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the age of our manufacturing facilities increases the risk for unplanned downtime, which may be significant.\nWe seek to run our complex production facilities on a nearly continuous basis for maximum efficiency and rely on the integrity of our logistics operations for the uninterrupted operations of business. While we have continued to make significant annual capital improvements at our manufacturing plants, operational issues have occurred in the past and may occur in the future, which could cause damage to our manufacturing and production equipment and ancillary facilities. Unplanned interruptions in our production capabilities adversely affect our production costs, product lead times and earnings during the affected period.\nOur manufacturing process is fully backward integrated. We use cumene, a chemical compound produced from benzene and propylene, to manufacture phenol, acetone and AMS, at our Frankford plant. The majority of the phenol we manufacture is further processed at our Hopewell facility through an integrated series of unit operations which also consume natural gas and sulfur to produce caprolactam and ammonium sulfate. Our caprolactam is then shipped to our Chesterfield plant, where it is polymerized into Nylon 6 resin. Although our integrated manufacturing, scale and the quantity and range of our product offerings make us one of the most efficient manufacturers in our industry, we are also exposed to increased risk associated with unplanned downtime or material disruptions at any one of our production facilities which could impact our supply chain to downstream plants in our manufacturing process.\nWe seek to mitigate the risk of unplanned downtime through regularly scheduled maintenance both for major and minor repairs at all of our production facilities. We also utilize maintenance and mechanical integrity programs and maintain an appropriate buffer inventory of intermediate chemicals necessary for our manufacturing process, both of which are intended to mitigate the extent of any production losses as a result of unplanned downtime. However, unplanned outages may still occur or we may not have enough intermediate chemical inventory at any given time to offset such production losses. Moreover, taking our production facilities offline for regularly scheduled repairs can be an expensive and time-consuming operation with risk that discoverable items and delays during the repair process may cause significant additional unplanned downtime as well. Any such unplanned downtime at any of our production facilities may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur production facilities and logistics operations are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss and material disruptions due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosion, severe weather conditions, earthquake or other natural disasters, personal injury or major accidents, acts of terrorism, prolonged power failures, chemical spills, unexpected repairs or other operational and logistical problems that we or a third-party on which we rely may experience. Depending on the nature, extent and length of any operational interruption due to any such event, the results could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRaw material price fluctuations and the ability of key suppliers to meet delivery requirements can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities.\nThe cost of raw materials, including cumene, natural gas and sulfur, is a key element in the cost of our products. Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula-based or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or commodity hedges could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we believe that our sources of supply for raw materials are generally robust, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages of raw materials or price increases may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers\u2019 inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long lead-time products during periods of fluctuating demand. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations and damage to customer relationships.\nWhen possible we have purchased, and we plan to continue to purchase, raw materials, including cumene, natural gas and sulfur, through negotiated medium- or long-term contracts. To the extent that we have been able to achieve favorable terms in our existing negotiated contracts, we may not be able to renew such contracts at the current terms or at all, and this may adversely impact our results of operations. To the extent that the markets for our raw materials significantly change, we may be bound by the terms of our existing supplier contracts and obligated to purchase such raw materials at disadvantaged terms as compared to other market participants.\nOur operations require substantial capital and we may not be able to obtain additional capital that we need in the future on favorable terms or at all.\nWe have historically relied on Honeywell for assistance in satisfying our capital requirements and are no longer able to rely on the earnings, assets or cash flow of Honeywell. As a result, we are responsible for obtaining and maintaining sufficient working capital and other funds to satisfy our cash requirements. Our industry is capital intensive, and we may require additional capital in the future to finance our growth and development, upgrade and improve our manufacturing capabilities, implement further marketing and sales activities, fund ongoing R&D activities, satisfy regulatory and environmental compliance obligations and meet general working capital needs. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including acceptance of and demand for our products, the extent to which we invest in new technology and R&D projects and the status and timing of these developments. We may need to seek additional capital in the future and debt or equity financing may not be available to us on terms we find acceptable, if at all. If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of our preferred stock, the terms of the debt or our preferred stock issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. If we raise funds through the issuance of additional common equity, ownership in us would be diluted. Also, regardless of the terms of our debt or equity financing, our agreements and obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement entered into in connection with the Spin-Off and that address compliance with Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) may limit our ability to issue stock. We believe that we have adequate capital resources to meet our projected operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. However, we may need additional capital resources in the future and if we are unable to obtain sufficient resources for our operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur operations are dependent on numerous required permits and approvals.\nWe hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities. In addition, any expansion of our operations is dependent upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals.\nA decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing material permit or approval, could have an adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of one or more of our significant customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on significant customers, many of whom have been doing business with us for decades, and the loss of one or several significant customers may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, our significant customers have the ability to influence pricing and other contract terms. Such influence could increase with the completion of the Spin-Off as our customers may have gained access to information that we otherwise in the past would not have publicly disclosed but are required to disclose as a public company.\nIn 2016, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 40% of our total sales. Our largest customer is Shaw Industries Group, Inc. (\u201cShaw\u201d), one of the world\u2019s largest consumers of caprolactam and Nylon 6 resin. We sell Nylon 6 resin and caprolactam to Shaw under a long-term contract. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, our sales to Shaw were 17%, 16%, and 19%, respectively, of our total sales. We typically sell to our other customers under short-term contracts with one- to two-year terms or by purchase orders.\nIf our sales to any of our significant customers were to decline, we may not be able to find other customers to purchase the excess supply of our products. The loss of one or several of our significant customers, or a significant reduction in purchase volume by any of them or significant unfavorable changes to pricing or other terms in contracts with any of them, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are also subject to credit risk associated with customer concentration. If one or more of our largest customers were to become bankrupt or insolvent, or otherwise were unable to pay for our products, we may incur significant write-offs of accounts that may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks related to adverse trade policies imposed against exports from the United States in certain important markets for our products.\nWe are subject to a series of antidumping investigations initiated by China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce (\u201cMOFCOM\u201d) covering the import of caprolactam and Nylon 6 resin into China. As a result of these investigations, significant antidumping duties were imposed on our products.\nIn addition, the Mexican government initiated an antidumping investigation on imports of ammonium sulfate into Mexico from the United States which resulted in antidumping duties being imposed on this product. These duties are currently still in place and must be paid by our customers in these countries to purchase our products, placing us at a significant competitive disadvantage in those markets.\nIn each case, we diligently evaluated our commercial and legal options to defend these investigations and their subsequent sunset reviews. Historically, we have successfully mitigated these risks through geographical mix management so that imposition of duties does not materially affect our business results. However, such duties could have an adverse effect on the sales of key product lines and affect our business performance in the future.\nThere can be no assurance that any governmental or international trade body in the future will not institute trade policies or remedies that are adverse to exports from the United States. Any significant changes in international trade policies, practices or trade remedies, especially those instituted in our target markets or markets where our major customers are located, could potentially increase the price of our products relative to our competitors or decrease our customers\u2019 demand for our products, which in turn may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that may result in unanticipated loss or liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVarious federal, state, local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. If we are found to be in violation of these laws or regulations, we may incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs, or experience interruptions in our operations. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulation and Environmental Matters\u201d for more information on the environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject.\nPrimarily because of our past operations at our current manufacturing locations and other locations used in our operations as currently conducted, we may be subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may have been or may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures or other hazardous conditions. Lawsuits, claims and costs involving these matters may arise in the future. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature, stringency and timing of any future regulations or changes in regulations, including greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) and water nutrient regulations. More stringent regulations, especially of GHGs, may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs, reduce our efficiency, limit our output, require us to make capital improvements to our facilities, increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy, raw materials or transportation or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If enacted, more stringent GHG limitations are likely to have a significant impact on us because our production facilities emit GHGs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas, a fossil fuel, is a primary raw material used in our production process. In addition, to the extent that GHG restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the United States, our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us.\nThere is also a risk that one or more of our key raw materials or one or more of our products may be found to have, or be characterized as having, a toxicological or health-related impact on the environment or on our customers or employees, which could potentially result in us incurring liability in connection with such characterization and the associated effects of any toxicological or health-related impact. If such a discovery or characterization occurs, we may incur increased costs in order to comply with new regulatory requirements or the relevant materials or products, including products of our customers incorporating our materials or products, may be recalled or banned. Changes in laws and regulations, or their interpretation, and our customers\u2019 perception of such changes or interpretations may also affect the marketability of certain of our products. Additionally, sales of acetone, which is a List II Chemical under TSCA, are regulated by the Drug Enforcement Act. This classification subjects us to periodic audits by the Drug Enforcement Administration and ongoing restrictions on our acetone sales activities.\nDue to concerns related to terrorism, we are subject to various security laws including MTSA and CFATS regulations. Our Frankford and Hopewell facilities are regulated facilities under CFATS and MTSA due to the nature of our operations and the proximity of the facilities to the adjacent waterways. Federal, state, local and foreign governments could implement new or impose more stringent regulations affecting the security of our plants, terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers or other chemicals. These regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs, lower sales and reduced profit margins. It is possible that federal, state, local and foreign governments could impose additional limitations on the use, sale or distribution of chemicals that we produce and sell, thereby limiting our ability to manufacture or sell those products, or that illicit use of our products could result in liability for us.\nHazards associated with chemical manufacturing, storage and transportation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are hazards associated with chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes. These hazards could lead to an interruption or suspension of operations and have an adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or on us as a whole. While we endeavor to provide adequate protection for the safe handling of these materials, issues could be created by various events, including natural disasters, severe weather events, acts of sabotage and performance by third parties, and as a result we could face potential hazards such as piping and storage tank leaks and ruptures, mechanical failure, employee exposure to hazardous substances and chemical spills and other discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases.\nThese hazards may cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to property and contamination of the environment, which could lead to government fines, work stoppage injunctions, lawsuits by injured persons, damage to our public reputation and brand and diminished product acceptance. If such actions are determined adversely to us or there is an associated economic impact to our business, we may have inadequate insurance or cash flow to offset any associated costs. Such outcomes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by litigation and other commitments and contingencies.\nWe face risks arising from various unasserted and asserted litigation matters, including, but not limited to, product liability and claims for third-party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental or other torts. We have noted a nationwide trend in purported class actions against chemical manufacturers generally seeking relief such as medical monitoring, property damages, off-site remediation and punitive damages arising from alleged environmental or other torts without claiming present personal injuries. We also have noted a trend in public and private nuisance suits being filed on behalf of states, counties, cities and utilities alleging harm to the general public.\nVarious factors or developments can lead to changes in current estimates of liabilities such as a final adverse judgment, significant settlement or changes in applicable law. An adverse outcome or unfavorable development in any one or more of these matters could be material to our financial results and could adversely impact the value of any of our brands that are associated with any such matters.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may make certain commitments, including representations, warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations, including those related to divested businesses, and issue guarantees of third-party obligations. Additionally, we will be required to indemnify Honeywell for amounts related to liabilities allocated to, or assumed by, us under each of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement entered into in connection with the Spin-Off. If we are required to make any such payments, the payments could be significant and could exceed the amounts we have accrued with respect thereto, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses, assets, products or technologies or realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe actively evaluate acquisitions and strategic investments in businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our business or otherwise offer growth or cost-saving opportunities. From time to time, we may enter into letters of intent with companies with which we are negotiating for potential acquisitions or investments, or as to which we are conducting due diligence. An investment in, or acquisition of, complementary businesses, products or technologies in the future could materially decrease the amount of our available cash or require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. We may not be successful in negotiating the terms of any potential acquisition, conducting thorough due diligence, financing the acquisition or effectively integrating the acquired business, product or technology into our existing business and operations. Our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, product or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, product quality or\nproduct architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer issues.\nAdditionally, in connection with any acquisitions we complete, we may not achieve the synergies or other benefits we expected to achieve, and we may incur unanticipated expenses, write-downs, impairment charges or unforeseen liabilities that could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions. Further, contemplating or completing an acquisition and integrating an acquired business, product or technology could divert management and employee time and resources from other matters.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIntellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, trade names and trade dress, are important to our business. We will endeavor to protect our intellectual property rights in key jurisdictions in which our products are produced or used. However, we may be unable to obtain protection for our intellectual property in such key jurisdictions. Although we own and have applied for numerous patents and trademarks, we may have to rely on judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights. Our patents and other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, and rendered unenforceable or otherwise compromised. If we must take legal action to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights, any suits or proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and our management\u2019s attention, and we may not prevail in any such suits or proceedings. A failure to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, third parties may assert claims against us and our customers and distributors alleging our products infringe upon third-party intellectual property rights.\nWe also rely materially upon unpatented proprietary technology, know-how and other trade secrets to maintain our competitive position. While we maintain policies and internal security measures to protect our trade secrets and other intellectual property, failure to protect this intellectual property could negatively affect our future performance and growth.\nWe may be required to make significant cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plan.\nAfter the Spin-Off, we sponsored a defined benefit pension plan under which certain eligible AdvanSix employees will earn pension benefits following the Spin-Off as if they remained employed by Honeywell. Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, retirement rates and other factors could require cash pension contributions in future periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. Our pension contributions may be material and could adversely impact our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations. We plan to make pension contributions during 2017 and in future periods sufficient to satisfy funding requirements.\nSome of our workforce is represented by labor unions and our business could be harmed in the event of a prolonged work stoppage.\nApproximately 750 of our employees are unionized, which represents approximately 55% of our employee-base as of December 31, 2016. We cannot predict how stable our union relationships will be or whether we will be able to successfully negotiate successor agreements without impacting our financial condition. In addition, the presence of unions may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. We may experience work stoppages, which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis and, ultimately, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to the complex nature of our manufacturing business, our future performance is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key engineering personnel, scientists and senior management, the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and management personnel for our operations. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. The loss of key employees, our inability to attract new qualified employees or adequately train employees, or the delay in hiring key personnel, could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nGlobal cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at AdvanSix, its plants and operations, its products, its customers and/or its third party service providers including cloud providers. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. We remain dependent on certain transition services from Honeywell with respect to information technology infrastructure, including cybersecurity, which seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond and mitigate these threats including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. We are actively planning the implementation of such measures internally as we design and establish the information technology infrastructure needed to operate independently. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, claims from and litigation with third parties, fines levied by governmental authorities, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls could adversely impact our ability to meet our reporting requirements.\nWe are required, under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. This includes performing system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, with auditor attestation of the effectiveness of our internal controls, beginning with our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. If we are not able to comply with these requirements in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our common shares could decline and we could be subject to penalties or investigations by the NYSE, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports, and to effectively prevent fraud. Internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nThe ongoing process of implementing internal controls in connection with our operation as a stand-alone company requires significant attention from management and we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we fail to obtain the quality of services necessary to operate effectively or incur greater costs in obtaining these services, our profitability, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to the Spin-Off\nThe Spin-Off could result in significant tax liability.\nCompletion of the Spin-Off was conditioned on Honeywell\u2019s receipt of a written opinion of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP to the effect that the Distribution should qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss under Section 355 of the Code. The opinion of counsel does not address any U.S. state, local or foreign tax consequences of the Spin-Off. The opinion assumes that the Spin-Off was completed according to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and relies on the facts as stated in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement, the other ancillary agreements, the Information Statement filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 10 and a number of other documents.\nIn addition, the opinion is based on certain representations as to factual matters from, and certain covenants by Honeywell and us. The opinion cannot be relied on if any of the assumptions, representations or covenants is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or is violated in any material respect.\nThe opinion of counsel is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. Honeywell did not request a ruling from the IRS regarding the U.S. Federal income tax consequences of the Spin-Off.\nIf the Distribution were determined not to qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss under Section 355(e) of the Code, our U.S. stockholders (as described in the Information Statement filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 10) could be subject to tax. In this case, each U.S. stockholder who received our common stock in the Distribution would generally be treated as having received a distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of our common stock received, which would generally result in (1) a taxable dividend to the U.S. stockholder to the extent of that U.S. stockholder\u2019s pro rata share of Honeywell\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits; (2) a reduction in the U.S. stockholder\u2019s basis (but not below zero) in its Honeywell common stock to the extent the amount received exceeds the stockholder\u2019s share of Honeywell\u2019s earnings and profits; and (3) a taxable gain from the exchange of Honeywell common stock to the extent the amount received exceeds the sum of the U.S. stockholder\u2019s share of Honeywell\u2019s earnings and profits and the U.S. stockholder\u2019s basis in its Honeywell common stock. A discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Spin-Off can be found in the Form 10.\nWe could have an indemnification obligation to Honeywell if the Distribution were determined not to qualify for non-recognition treatment, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf, due to any of our representations being untrue or our covenants being breached, it were determined that the Distribution did not qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss under Section 355 of the Code, we could be required to indemnify Honeywell for the resulting taxes and related expenses. Any such indemnification obligation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, Section 355(e) of the Code generally creates a presumption that the Distribution would be taxable to Honeywell, but not to stockholders, if we or our stockholders were to engage in transactions that result in a 50% or greater change by vote or value in the ownership of our stock during the four-year period beginning on the date that begins two years before the date of the Distribution, unless it were established that such transactions and the Distribution were not part of a plan or series of related transactions giving effect to such a change in ownership. If the Distribution were taxable to Honeywell due to such a 50% or greater change in ownership of our stock, Honeywell would recognize gain equal to the excess of the fair market value of our common stock distributed to Honeywell stockholders over Honeywell\u2019s tax basis in our common stock and we generally would be required to indemnify Honeywell for the tax on such gain and related expenses. Any such indemnification obligation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous restrictions to preserve the non-recognition treatment of the Spin-Off, which may reduce our strategic and operating flexibility.\nWe are subject to covenants and indemnification obligations pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement that address compliance with Section 355 of the Code and preserve the tax-free nature of the Spin-Off. These covenants include certain restrictions on our activity unless Honeywell gives its consent for us to take a restricted action, which Honeywell is permitted to grant or withhold at its sole discretion. These covenants and indemnification obligations may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new businesses or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business, and might discourage or delay a strategic transaction that our stockholders may consider favorable.\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Spin-Off.\nWe believe that, as an independent, publicly-traded company, we will be able to, among other things, design and implement corporate strategies and policies that are targeted to our business, better focus our financial and operational resources on those specific strategies, create effective incentives for our management and employees that are more closely tied to our business performance, provide investors more flexibility and enable us to achieve alignment with a more natural stockholder base and implement and maintain a capital structure designed to meet our specific needs. We may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company in the time we expect, if at all. The transition to operating as an independent, publicly traded company following the Spin-Off requires significant amounts of our management\u2019s time and effort, which may divert management\u2019s attention from operating and growing our business. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate as an independent, publicly-traded company, and we may experience increased costs after the Spin-Off.\nWe have historically operated as part of Honeywell\u2019s corporate organization, with Honeywell providing us with various corporate functions. Following the Spin-Off, Honeywell has no obligation to provide us with assistance other than certain transition and other related services. A description of the materials terms and conditions of such agreements with Honeywell can be found in the section titled \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions\u201d of the Company\u2019s Information Statement filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 10. These services do not include every service that we have received from Honeywell in the past, and Honeywell is only obligated to provide the transition services for limited periods following completion of the Spin-Off. Accordingly, we are responsible to provide internally, or obtain from unaffiliated third parties, services such as legal, accounting, information technology (including cybersecurity), human resources and other infrastructure support, the effective and appropriate services, hardware, networks or software to perform activities critical to our operations. Because our business has historically operated as part of the wider Honeywell organization, we may be unable to successfully establish the infrastructure or implement the changes necessary to operate independently, or we may incur additional costs that could adversely affect our business. If we fail to obtain the quality of services necessary to operate effectively or incur greater costs in obtaining these services, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe have limited recent operating history as an independent, publicly-traded company, and our historical consolidated and combined financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent, publicly-traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nWe derived the historical consolidated and combined financial information prior to the Spin-Off included in this Form 10-K from Honeywell\u2019s consolidated financial statements, and this information does not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial position we would have achieved as an independent, publicly-traded company during the periods presented, or those that we will achieve in the future. This is primarily because of the following factors:\n\u2022 Prior to the Spin-Off, we operated as part of Honeywell\u2019s broader corporate organization, and Honeywell performed various corporate functions for us. Our historical consolidated and combined financial information prior to the Spin-Off reflects allocations of corporate expenses from Honeywell for these and similar functions. These allocations may not reflect the costs we will incur for similar services in the future as an independent, publicly-traded company.\n\u2022 We have entered into transactions with Honeywell that did not exist prior to the Spin-Off, such as Honeywell\u2019s provision of transition and other services, which will cause us to incur new costs. See the section titled \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions\u201d of the Company\u2019s Information Statement filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 10.\n\u2022 Our historical consolidated and combined financial information prior to the Spin-Off does not reflect changes that we expect to experience in the future as a result of our separation from Honeywell, including changes in the financing, cash management, operations, cost structure and personnel needs of our business. As part of Honeywell, there were certain benefits derived from Honeywell\u2019s operating diversity, size, purchasing power, borrowing leverage and available capital for investments. As an independent entity, we may be unable to purchase goods, services and technologies, such as insurance and health care benefits and computer software licenses, or access capital markets on terms as favorable to us as those we obtained as part of Honeywell prior to the Spin-Off. In addition, our historical consolidated and combined financial data does not include an allocation of interest expense comparable to the interest expense we will incur as a result of the series of internal transactions which were effected in order for us to hold, directly or through our subsidiaries, the businesses constituting Honeywell\u2019s Resins and Chemicals business and related operations, and the Spin-Off, including interest expense in connection with the incurrence of indebtedness at AdvanSix.\nFollowing the Spin-Off, we are also responsible for the additional costs associated with being an independent, publicly-traded company, including costs related to corporate governance, investor and public relations and public reporting. While we have been profitable as part of Honeywell, we cannot assure you that our profits will continue at a similar level when we are an independent, publicly-traded company.\nRisks Relating to the Indebtedness\nWe incurred new indebtedness in connection with the Spin-Off, and our leverage could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we incurred indebtedness in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $270 million in the form of term loans. We also entered into a $155 million revolving facility to be available for our working capital and other cash needs. Following the Spin-Off, we are responsible for servicing our own debt and obtaining and maintaining sufficient working capital and other funds to satisfy our cash requirements.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the debt incurred in connection with the Spin-Off, as well as any future debt that we may incur, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nThe terms of our indebtedness restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to incur debt that we may need to fund initiatives in response to changes in our business, the industries in which we operate, the economy and governmental regulations.\nThe terms of our indebtedness include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and limit our ability to engage in actions that may be in our long-term best interests. These may restrict our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to take some or all of the following actions:\n\u2022 Incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or sell disqualified or preferred stock;\n\u2022 Pay dividends on, make distributions in respect of, repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\u2022 Make investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022 Sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of certain assets;\n\u2022 Create liens;\n\u2022 Enter into sale/leaseback transactions;\n\u2022 Enter into agreements restricting the ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany transfers;\n\u2022 Consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 assets;\n\u2022 Enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022 Prepay, repurchase or redeem certain kinds of indebtedness;\n\u2022 Issue or sell stock of our subsidiaries; and/or\n\u2022 Significantly change the nature of our business.\nAs a result of all of these restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct our business and pursue our strategy, unable to raise additional debt financing to operate during general economic or business downturns or unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nA breach of any of these covenants, if applicable, could result in an event of default under the terms of this indebtedness. If an event of default occurs, the lenders would have the right to accelerate the repayment of such debt and the event of default or acceleration may result in the acceleration of the repayment of any other debt to which a cross-default or cross-acceleration provision applies. Furthermore, the lenders of this indebtedness may require that we pledge our assets as collateral and, in the event we were unable to repay any amount of this indebtedness when due and payable, the lenders could proceed against the pledged collateral. In the event our creditors accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nNo market for our common stock existed prior to the Spin-Off and, as a result, our stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThere was no public market for our common stock prior to the Spin-Off.\nFollowing the Spin-Off, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022 Actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations due to factors related to our business;\n\u2022 Success or failure of our business strategies;\n\u2022 Competition and industry capacity;\n\u2022 Changes in interest rates and other factors that affect earnings and cash flow;\n\u2022 Our level of indebtedness, our ability to make payments on or service our indebtedness and our ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022 Our ability to retain and recruit qualified personnel;\n\u2022 Our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022 Announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022 Changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022 The failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock after the Spin-Off;\n\u2022 Changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022 The operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022 Investor perception of our company and our industry;\n\u2022 Overall market fluctuations unrelated to our operating performance;\n\u2022 Results from any material litigation or government investigation;\n\u2022 Changes in laws and regulations (including tax laws and regulations) affecting our business;\n\u2022 Changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; and\n\u2022 General economic conditions and other external factors.\nPotential for low trading volume for our stock would amplify the effect of the above factors on our stock price volatility.\nWe will evaluate whether to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future, and the terms of our indebtedness will limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe will be evaluating whether to pay cash dividends to our stockholders and the timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders, if any, will fall within the discretion of our Board. Among the items we will consider when establishing a dividend policy will be the capital intensive nature of our business and opportunities to retain future earnings for use in the operation of our business and to fund future growth. Additionally, the terms of our indebtedness may limit our ability to pay cash dividends. There can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay any dividend if we do commence paying dividends.\nStockholder percentage ownership in AdvanSix may be diluted in the future.\nA Stockholder\u2019s percentage ownership in AdvanSix may be diluted in the future because of common stock-based equity awards that we have granted and expect to grant in the future to our directors, officers and other employees. Prior to completion of the Spin-Off, we approved an incentive plan that provided for the grant of common stock-based equity awards to our directors, officers and other employees. In addition, we may issue equity as all or part of the consideration paid for acquisitions and strategic investments that we may make in the future or as necessary to finance our ongoing operations.\nCertain provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws and Delaware law may discourage takeovers.\nSeveral provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that is opposed by our Board. These include, among others, provisions that:\n\u2022 Provide for staggered terms for directors on our Board through our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022 Do not permit our stockholders to act by written consent and require that stockholder action must take place at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022 Establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations and proposals;\n\u2022 Limit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022 Limit our ability to enter into business combination transactions with certain stockholders.\nThese and other provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or a threatened acquisition or change in control of AdvanSix, including unsolicited takeover attempts, even though the transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock at a price above the prevailing market price.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation will designate the courts of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery located within the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of AdvanSix, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee or stockholder of AdvanSix to AdvanSix or AdvanSix\u2019s stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporate Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery located in the State of Delaware or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. However, if the Court of Chancery within the State of Delaware does not have jurisdiction, the action may be brought in any other state or federal court located within the State of Delaware. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to these provisions. This provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions.", "PERMNO": 16276, "SIC": 2820, "TIC": "ASIX"}
