You should\nconsider carefully the following risk factors before\ndeciding whether to invest in our common stock. Our business, including\nour operating results and financial condition, could be\nharmed by any of these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently\nknown to us or that we currently deem to be\nimmaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business. The trading\nprice of our common stock could decline due to\nany of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks,\nyou should also refer to the other\ninformation contained in our filings with the SEC, including our financial\nstatements and related notes.\nMarket Risks\nWe may incur losses if we are\nunable to successfully manage interest rate risk.\nOur profitability depends to a large extent on Capital City Bank\u2019s\nnet interest income, which is the difference between income on\ninterest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and\nexpense on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and\nborrowings. We\nare unable to predict changes in market interest rates, which are affected\nby many factors beyond our control,\nincluding inflation, recession, unemployment, federal funds\ntarget rate, money supply,\ndomestic and international events and\nchanges in the United States and other financial markets. Our net interest income\nmay be reduced if: (i) more interest-earning\nassets than interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature during a time\nwhen interest rates are declining or (ii) more interest-bearing\nliabilities than interest-earning assets reprice or mature during a time\nwhen interest rates are rising.\nChanges in the difference between short-term\nand long-term interest rates may also harm our business. We\ngenerally use short-\nterm deposits to fund longer-term assets. When interest rates change,\nassets and liabilities with shorter terms reprice more quickly\nthan those with longer terms, which could have a material adverse effect\non our net interest margin. If market interest rates rise\nrapidly, interest rate adjustment\ncaps may also limit increases in the interest rates on adjustable rate loans, which\ncould further\nreduce our net interest income. Additionally,\nwe believe that due to the current low interest rate environment, the effects of\nthe\nrepeal of Regulation Q, which previously had prohibited the payment\nof interest on demand deposits by member banks of the\nFederal Reserve System, have not been realized. The increased price competition\nfor deposits that may result upon the return to a\nhistorically normal interest rate environment could adversely affect\nnet interest margins of community banks.\nAlthough we continuously monitor interest rates and have a number\nof tools to manage our interest rate risk exposure, changes in\nmarket assumptions regarding future interest rates could significantly impact\nour interest rate risk strategy,\nour financial position\nand results of operations. If we do not properly monitor our interest rate risk management\nstrategies, these activities may not\neffectively mitigate our interest rate sensitivity or have\nthe desired impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nInterest rates and economic conditions affect consumer\ndemand for housing and can create volatility in the mortgage industry.\nThese risks can have a material impact on the volume of mortgage originations\nand refinancings, adversely affecting mortgage\nbanking revenues and the profitability of our mortgage banking business.\nSee Item 7.\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations under the section captioned\n\u201cNet Interest Income\u201d and \u201cMarket Risk and Interest Rate Sensitivity\u201d elsewhere\nin this report for further discussion related to\ninterest rate sensitivity and our management of interest rate risk.\nThe fair value of our investments could decline which would cause a reduction\nin shareowners\u2019 equity.\nA large portion of our investment securities portfolio\nat December 31, 2021 has been designated as available-for-sale\npursuant to\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles relating to\naccounting for investments. Such principles require that unrealized gains\nand losses in the estimated value of the available-for-sale portfolio\nbe \u201cmarked to market\u201d and reflected as a separate item in\nshareowners\u2019 equity (net of tax) as accumulated other comprehensive\nincome/losses. Shareowners\u2019 equity will continue to reflect\nthe unrealized gains and losses (net of tax) of these investments. The\nfair value of our investment portfolio may decline, causing a\ncorresponding decline in shareowners\u2019 equity.\nManagement believes that several factors will affect\nthe fair values of our investment portfolio. These include, but are not limited\nto, changes in interest rates or expectations of changes in interest rates, the\ndegree of volatility in the securities markets, inflation\nrates or expectations of inflation and the slope of the interest rate yield\ncurve (the yield curve refers to the differences between\nshort-term and long-term interest rates; a positively sloped yield curve means short\n-term rates are lower than long-term rates).\nThese and other factors may impact specific categories of the portfolio differently,\nand we cannot predict the effect these factors\nmay have on any specific category.\nShares of our common stock are not an insured\ndeposit and may lose value.\nThe shares of our common stock are not a bank deposit and will not be insured or guaranteed\nby the FDIC or any other\ngovernment agency.\nYour\ninvestment will be subject to investment risk, and you must be capable of affording\nthe loss of your\nentire investment.\nLimited trading activity for shares of our common\nstock may contribute to price volatility.\nWhile our common stock is listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market,\nthere has historically been limited trading\nactivity in our common stock.\nThe average daily trading volume of our common stock over the 12-month\nperiod ending\nDecember 31, 2021 was approximately 29,919 shares. Due to the limited\ntrading activity of our common stock, relativity small\ntrades may have a significant impact on the price of our common stock.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate coverage or continue to cover our common\nstock, and this may have a negative impact\non its market price.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research\nand reports that securities analysts publish about us\nand our business. We do\nnot have any control over securities analysts, and they may not initiate coverage\nor continue to cover our\ncommon stock. If securities analysts do not cover our common stock,\nthe lack of research coverage may adversely affect its\nmarket price. If we are covered by securities analysts, and our common stock is the subject of\nan unfavorable report, our stock\nprice would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover\nour Company or fails to publish regular reports on us,\nwe could lose visibility in the financial markets, which may cause our\nstock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe may be adversely impacted by\nthe transition from LIBOR as a reference\nrate.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Financial\nConduct Authority and the administrator of LIBOR have announced\nthat the publication of the\nmost commonly used U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d)\nsettings will cease to be published or cease to be\nrepresentative after June 30, 2023.\nThe publication of all other LIBOR settings ceased to be published as of December\n31, 2021.\nGiven\nconsumer\nprotection, litigation, and reputation\nrisks, the bank regulatory\nagencies\nhave\nindicated\nthat entering\ninto\nnew\ncontracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021, would\ncreate safety and soundness risks and that they\nwill examine bank practices accordingly.\nTherefore, the agencies encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts that use\nLIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31,\n2021.\nPrior to December 31, 2021, we\ndiscontinued originating LIBOR-based loans.\nAt December 31, 2021, we have 108 loans totaling approximately $77 million\nthat are indexed to LIBOR.\nWe believe our\ncurrent\nportfolio of LIBOR based loan contracts contain the necessary fallback langu\nage, however, the timing and manner in which each\ncustomer\u2019s contract transitions to a replacement index will vary\non a case-by-case basis.\nWe also have\n$34 million in floating rate\ninvestment securities that are indexed\nto LIBOR.\nWe are currently\nevaluating fallback language for each investment security.\nLastly, we have two\nfloating rate subordinated debenture notes totaling $53 million and a related interest\nrate swap contract for\n$30 million that are indexed to LIBOR (Refer to Note 12 - Long Term\nBorrowings and Note 5 - Derivatives in our Consolidated\nFinancial Statements).\nThe subordinated debenture notes do not contain fallback language allowing\nfor a replacement rate, but\nwill convert to a fixed rate (LIBOR plus margin) at the time of\nLIBOR cessation.\nThe interest rate swap contract adheres to ISDA\nprotocol which requires conversion to the fallback SOFR rate at the time of\nLIBOR cessation.\nThere continues to be substantial\nuncertainty as to the ultimate effects of the LIBOR transition,\nincluding with respect to the acceptance and use of other\nbenchmark rates.\nSince replacement rates are calculated differently,\npayments under contracts referencing new rates will differ\nfrom those referencing LIBOR, which may lead to increased volatility as compared\nto LIBOR.\nCOVID-19 Risks\nThe ongoing global COVID-19 outbreak could harm our\nbusiness and results of operations. The magnitude and duration\nof the pandemic\u2019s impact will depend on future\ndevelopments, which are highly uncertain and\nare difficult to predict.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively impact economic\nand commercial activity and financial markets, both globally\nand within the United States. Stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions and\nclosure of non-essential businesses and similar orders\nimposed across the United States to restrict the spread of COVID-19 in 2021\nresulted in significant business and operational\ndisruptions, including business closures, supply chain disruptions,\nand mass layoffs and furloughs. Although local jurisdictions\nwere not subject to stay-at-home orders, worker shortages, vaccine\nand testing requirements, new variants of COVID-19 and\nother health and safety recommendations have impacted the ability of\nbusinesses to return to pre-pandemic levels of activity and\nemployment.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a specific impact\non our business, including: (1) causing some of our borrowers to be unable\nto\nmeet existing payment obligations, particularly borrowers disproportionately\naffected by business shutdowns and travel\nrestrictions;\n(2) requiring us to increase our allowance for loan losses; and (3) affecting\nconsumer and business spending,\nborrowing and savings habits. The ultimate risk posed by the COVID-19 pandemic\nremains highly uncertain; however, COVID-\n19 poses a material risk to our business, financial condition and results of\noperations. Other factors likely to have an adverse\neffect on our results of operations include:\n\u25cf\nrisks to the capital markets due to the volatility in financial markets that\nmay impact the performance of our investment\nsecurities portfolio;\n\u25cf\neffects on key employees, including operational management\npersonnel and those charged with preparing, monitoring\nand evaluating our financial reporting and internal controls;\n\u25cf\ndeclines in demand for loans and other banking services and products, as well as increases\nin our non-performing loans,\nowing to the effects of COVID-19 in the markets served by the Bank\nand on the business of borrowers of the Bank;\n\u25cf\ndeclines in demand resulting from adverse impacts of the virus on businesses deemed\nto be \u201cnon-essential\u201d by\ngovernments in the markets served by the Bank;\n\u25cf\nreduced fees as we waive certain fees for our customers impacted by\nthe COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u25cf\nhigher operating costs, increased\ncybersecurity risks and potential loss of productivity while some of our associates work\nremotely.\nLastly, our commercial\nreal estate and multi-family loans are dependent on the profitable operation and mana\ngement of the\nproperties securing such loans. The longer the pandemic persists, the\nstronger the likelihood that COVID-19 could have a\nsignificant adverse impact by reducing the revenue and cash flows of\nour borrowers, impacting the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay\ntheir loans, increasing the risk of delinquencies and defaults, and reducing\nthe collateral value underlying the loans.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will ultimately affect\nour financial condition and results of operations is unknown\nand will depend, among other things, on the duration of the pandemic,\nthe actions undertaken by national, state and local\ngovernments and health officials to contain the virus or mitigate\nits effects, the safety and effectiveness of\nthe vaccines that have\nbeen developed and the ability of pharmaceutical companies and governments\nto continue to manufacture and distribute those\nvaccines, changes to interest rates, and how quickly and to what extent economic\nconditions improve and normal business and\noperating conditions resume. Any one or a combination of these factors could\nnegatively impact our business, financial condition\nand results of operations and prospects.\nCredit Risks\nOur loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss which could lead to higher loan\nlosses and nonperforming\nassets.\nWe originate\ncommercial real estate loans, commercial loans, construction loans, vacant\nland loans, consumer loans, and\nresidential mortgage loans primarily within our market area. Commercial\nreal estate, commercial, construction, vacant land, and\nconsumer loans may expose a lender to greater credit risk than traditional\nfixed-rate fully amortizing loans secured by single-\nfamily residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans may\nnot be sold as easily as single-family residential real\nestate. In addition, these loan types tend to involve larger\nloan balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers and\nare more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle.\nThese loans also have historically had greater credit\nrisk than other loans for the following reasons:\n\u25cf\nCommercial Real Estate Loans\n. Repayment is dependent on income being generated in amounts\nsufficient to cover\noperating expenses and debt service. These loans also involve greater risk because\nthey are generally not fully amortizing\nover the loan period, but rather have a balloon payment due at maturity.\nA borrower\u2019s ability to make a balloon payment\ntypically will depend on the borrower\u2019s ability to either\nrefinance the loan or timely sell the underlying property.\nAt\nDecember 31, 2021, commercial mortgage loans comprised approximately\n34.4% of our total loan portfolio.\n\u25cf\nCommercial Loans\n. Repayment is generally dependent upon the successful operation\nof the borrower\u2019s business. In\naddition, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, be\ndifficult to appraise, be illiquid, or fluctuate in\nvalue based on the success of the business. At December 31, 2021, commercial\nloans comprised approximately 11.6%\nof\nour total loan portfolio.\n\u25cf\nConstruction Loans\n. The risk of loss is largely dependent on our initial estimate of\nwhether the property\u2019s value at\ncompletion equals or exceeds the cost of property construction and the\navailability of take-out financing. During the\nconstruction phase, a number of factors can result in delays or cost overruns.\nIf our estimate is inaccurate or if actual\nconstruction costs exceed estimates, the value of the property securing\nour loan may be insufficient to ensure full\nrepayment when completed through a permanent loan, sale of the property,\nor by seizure of collateral.\nAt December 31,\n2021, construction loans comprised approximately 9.0% of our total loan\nportfolio.\n\u25cf\nVacant\nLand Loans\n. Because vacant or unimproved land is generally held by the borrower\nfor investment purposes or\nfuture use, payments on loans secured by vacant or unimproved land will typically\nrank lower in priority to the borrower\nthan a loan the borrower may have on their primary residence or business. These\nloans are susceptible to adverse\nconditions in the real estate market and local economy.\nAt December 31, 2021, vacant land loans comprised\napproximately 3.42% of our total loan portfolio.\n\u25cf\nHELOCs\n. Our open-ended home equity loans have an interest-only draw period\nfollowed by a five-year repayment\nperiod of 0.75% of the principal balance monthly and a balloon payment\nat maturity. Upon the commencement\nof the\nrepayment period, the monthly payment can increase significantly,\nthus, there is a heightened risk that the borrower will\nbe unable to pay the increased payment. Further,\nthese loans also involve greater risk because they are generally not fully\namortizing over the loan period, but rather have a balloon payment\ndue at maturity.\nA borrower\u2019s ability to make a\nballoon payment may depend on the borrower\u2019s ability\nto either refinance the loan or timely sell the underlying property.\nAt December 31, 2021, HELOCs comprised approximately 9.7% of\nour total loan portfolio.\n\u25cf\nConsumer Loans\n. Consumer loans (such as automobile loans and personal lines of\ncredit) are collateralized, if at all,\nwith assets that may not provide an adequate source of payment of\nthe loan due to depreciation, damage, or loss. At\nDecember 31, 2021, consumer loans comprised approximately 16.7\n%\nof our total loan portfolio, with indirect auto loans\nmaking up a majority of this portfolio at approximately 93.1% of the total\nbalance.\nThe increased risks associated with these types of loans result in a correspondingly\nhigher probability of default on such loans (as\ncompared to fixed-rate fully amortizing single-family real estate loans).\nLoan defaults would likely increase our loan losses and\nnonperforming assets and could adversely affect our\nallowance for loan losses and our results of operations.\nOur loan portfolio is heavily concentrated in mortgage loans secured\nby properties in Florida and Georgia which causes\nour risk of loss to be higher than if we had a more geographically diversified\nportfolio.\nOur interest-earning assets are heavily concentrated in mortgage loans secured\nby real estate, particularly real estate located in\nFlorida and Georgia.\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 72% of our loans included real estate as a primary,\nsecondary, or\ntertiary component of collateral. The real estate collateral in each case provides\nan alternate source of repayment in the event of\ndefault by the borrower; however, the value\nof the collateral may decline during the time the credit is extended. If we\nare required\nto liquidate the collateral securing a loan during a period of reduced real\nestate values to satisfy the debt, our earnings and capital\ncould be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, at\nDecember 31, 2021, substantially all of our loans secured by real estate are secured by\ncommercial and residential\nproperties located in Northern Florida and Middle Georgia. The\nconcentration of our loans in these areas subjects us to risk that a\ndownturn in the economy or recession in these areas could result in a decrease\nin loan originations and increases in delinquencies\nand foreclosures, which would more greatly affect us than\nif our lending were more geographically diversified. In addition, since\na large portion of our portfolio is secured by properties located\nin Florida and Georgia, the occurrence of a natural disaster,\nsuch\nas a hurricane, or a man-made disaster could result in a decline in loan originations,\na decline in the value or destruction of\nmortgaged properties and an increase in the risk of delinquencies, foreclosures\nor loss on loans originated by us. We\nmay suffer\nfurther losses due to the decline in the value of the properties underlying\nour mortgage loans, which would have an adverse\nimpact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur concentration in loans secured by real estate\nmay increase our credit losses, which would negatively\naffect our\nfinancial results.\nDue to the lack of diversified industry within the markets served by CCB and the relatively\nclose proximity of our geographic\nmarkets, we have both geographic concentrations as well as concentrations\nin the types of loans funded. Specifically,\ndue to the\nnature of our markets, a significant portion of the portfolio has historically been\nsecured with real estate. At December 31, 2021,\napproximately 38% and 34% of our $1.931 billion loan portfolio was secured\nby commercial real estate and residential real estate,\nrespectively. As of\nthis same date, approximately 9% was secured by property under construction.\nIn the event we are required to foreclose on a property securing one of our mortgage\nloans or otherwise pursue our remedies in\norder to protect our investment, we may be unable to recover funds in an amount\nequal to our projected return on our investment\nor in an amount sufficient to prevent a loss to us due to prevailing economic\nconditions, real estate values and other factors\nassociated with the ownership of real property.\nAs a result, the market value of the real estate or other collateral underlying our\nloans may not, at any given time, be sufficient to satisfy the outstanding\nprincipal amount of the loans, and consequently,\nwe\nwould sustain loan losses.\nAn inadequate allowance for credit losses would reduce\nour earnings.\nWe are exposed\nto the risk that our clients may be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and\nthat any collateral\nsecuring the payment of their loans may not be sufficient\nto assure full repayment. This could result in credit losses that are\ninherent in the lending business. We\nevaluate the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance\nfor credit losses\nthat we believe is adequate based upon such factors as:\n\u25cf\nthe risk characteristics of various classifications of loans;\n\u25cf\nprevious loan loss experience;\n\u25cf\nspecific loans that have loss potential;\n\u25cf\ndelinquency trends;\n\u25cf\nestimated fair market value of the collateral;\n\u25cf\ncurrent and future economic conditions; and\n\u25cf\ngeographic and industry loan concentrations.\nAt December 31, 2021, our allowance for credit losses for loans held\nfor investment was $21.6 million, which represented\napproximately 1.12% of our total loans held for investment.\nWe had $4.3\nmillion in nonaccruing loans at December 31, 2021.\nThe allowance is based on management\u2019s\nreasonable estimate and may not prove sufficient to cover future\nloan losses.\nAlthough\nmanagement uses the best information available to make determinations\nwith respect to the allowance for credit losses, future\nadjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ\nsubstantially from the assumptions used or adverse developments\narise with respect to our nonperforming or performing loans.\nIn addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their\nexamination process, periodically review our estimated losses on loans.\nOur regulators may require us to recognize additional\nlosses based on their judgments about information available to them at the\ntime of their examination.\nAccordingly, the allowance\nfor credit losses may not be adequate to cover all future loan losses and significant\nincreases to the allowance may be required in\nthe future if, for example, economic conditions worsen.\nA material increase in our allowance for credit losses would adversely\nimpact our net income and capital in future periods, while having the effect\nof overstating our current period earnings.\nWe may incur significant costs associated\nwith the ownership of real property as a\nresult of foreclosures, which could\nreduce our net income.\nSince we originate loans secured by real estate, we may have to foreclose on\nthe collateral property to protect our investment and\nmay thereafter own and operate such property,\nin which case we would be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of\nreal\nestate.\nThe amount that we, as a mortgagee, may realize after a foreclosure is dependent\nupon factors outside of our control, including,\nbut not limited to:\n\u25cf\ngeneral or local economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nenvironmental cleanup liability;\n\u25cf\nneighborhood values;\n\u25cf\ninterest rates;\n\u25cf\nreal estate tax rates;\n\u25cf\noperating expenses of the mortgaged properties;\n\u25cf\nsupply of and demand for rental units or properties;\n\u25cf\nability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties;\n\u25cf\nzoning laws;\n\u25cf\ngovernmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies; and\n\u25cf\nacts of God.\nCertain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, including\nreal estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs,\nmay adversely affect the income from the real estate. Furthermore,\nwe may need to advance funds to continue to operate or to\nprotect these assets. As a result, the cost of operating real property\nassets may exceed the rental income earned from such\nproperties or we may be required to dispose of the real property at a loss.\nLiquidity Risks\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our\nfinancial condition.\nEffective liquidity management is essential for the operation\nof our business. We require\nsufficient liquidity to meet client loan\nrequests, client deposit maturities and withdrawals, payments on our\ndebt obligations as they come due and other cash\ncommitments under both normal operating conditions and other\nunpredictable circumstances causing industry or general financial\nmarket stress. If we are unable to raise funds through deposits, borrowings,\nearnings and other sources, it could have a substantial\nnegative effect on our liquidity.\nIn particular, a majority of our liabilities during\n2021 were checking accounts and other liquid\ndeposits, which are generally payable on demand or upon short notice.\nBy comparison, a substantial majority of our assets were\nloans, which cannot generally be called or sold in the same time frame.\nAlthough we have historically been able to replace\nmaturing deposits and advances as necessary,\nwe might not be able to replace such funds in the future, especially if\na large\nnumber of our depositors seek to withdraw their accounts at the same time,\nregardless of the reason. Our access to funding\nsources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms that are acceptable\nto us could be impaired by factors that affect us\nspecifically or the financial services industry or economy in general.\nFactors that could negatively impact our access to liquidity\nsources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of\na downturn in the markets in which our loans are\nconcentrated, adverse regulatory action against us, or our inability to attract\nand retain deposits. Our ability to borrow could also\nbe impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption\nin the financial markets or negative views and expectations\nabout the prospects for the financial services industry.\nIf we are unable to maintain adequate liquidity,\nit could materially and\nadversely affect our business, results of operations or\nfinancial condition.\nWe may be unable to pay dividends in the\nfuture.\nIn 2021, our Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends.\nDeclarations of any future dividends will be contingent on\nour ability to earn sufficient profits and to remain well capitalized,\nincluding our ability to hold and generate sufficient\ncapital to\ncomply with the CET1 conservation buffer requirement.\nIn addition, due to our contractual obligations with the holders of our\ntrust preferred securities, if we defer the payment of accrued interest owed to the holders\nof our trust preferred securities, we may\nnot make dividend payments to our shareowners.\nFurther, under applicable statutes and regulations,\nCCB\u2019s board of directors,\nafter charging-off bad debts, depreciation and\nother\nworthless assets, if any,\nand making provisions for reasonably anticipated future losses on loans and other\nassets, may quarterly,\nsemi-annually, or\nannually declare and pay dividends to CCBG of up to the aggregate net income\nof that period combined with\nthe CCB\u2019s retained net income\nfor the preceding two years and, with the approval of the Florida Office\nof Financial Regulation\nand Federal Reserve, declare a dividend from retained net income which\naccrued prior to the preceding two years.\nAdditional\nstate laws generally applicable to Florida corporations may also limit our ability\nto declare and pay dividends. Thus, our ability to\nfund future dividends may be restricted by state and federal laws and regulations.\nRegulatory and Compliance Risks\nWe are subject to\nextensive regulation, which could restrict our\nactivities and impose financial requirements or limitations\non the conduct of our business.\nWe are subject\nto extensive regulation, supervision and examination by our regulators,\nincluding the Florida Office of Financial\nRegulation, the Federal\nReserve, and the FDIC. Our compliance with these industry regulations is costly\nand restricts certain of\nour activities, including payment of dividends, mergers\nand acquisitions, investments, lending and interest rates charged on\nloans,\ninterest rates paid on deposits, access to capital and brokered deposits and\nlocations of banking offices. If we are unable to meet\nthese regulatory requirements, our financial condition, liquidity and\nresults of operations would be materially and adversely\naffected.\nOur activities are also regulated under consumer protection laws applicable\nto our lending, deposit and other activities. Many of\nthese regulations are intended primarily for the protection of our\ndepositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the\nbenefit of our shareowners. In addition to the regulations of the bank\nregulatory agencies, as a member of the Federal Home Loan\nBank, we must also comply with applicable regulations of the Federal Housing\nFinance Agency and the Federal Home Loan\nBank.\nOur failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to restrictions\non our business activities, fines and other\npenalties, any of which could adversely affect our results\nof operations, capital base and the price of our securities. Further,\nany\nnew laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult\nor expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business and\nfinancial condition. Please refer to the Section entitled \u201cBusiness - Regulatory\nConsiderations\u201d on page 10.\nU.S. federal banking agencies may require us to\nincrease our regulatory capital, long-term\ndebt or liquidity requirements,\nwhich could result in the need to issue additional qualifying securities or\nto take other actions, such as to sell company\nassets.\nWe are subject\nto U.S. regulatory capital and liquidity rules. These rules, among other things,\nestablish minimum requirements to\nqualify as a well-capitalized institution. If CCB fails to maintain its status as well\ncapitalized under the applicable regulatory\ncapital rules, the Federal Reserve will require us to agree to bring the bank\nback to well-capitalized status. For the duration of\nsuch an agreement, the Federal Reserve may impose restrictions on our\nactivities. If we were to fail to enter into or comply with\nsuch an agreement or fail to comply with the terms of such agreement, the Federal\nReserve may impose more severe restrictions\non our activities, including requiring us to cease and desist activities permitted\nunder the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956.\nCapital and liquidity requirements are frequently introduced and\namended. It is possible that regulators may increase regulatory\ncapital requirements, change how regulatory capital is calculated or increase\nliquidity requirements.\nIn 2013, the Federal Reserve Board released its final rules which implement\nin the United States the Basel III regulatory capital\nreforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain\nchanges required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the final\nrule, minimum requirements increased for both the quality and quantity of capital\nheld by banking organizations. Consistent with\nthe international Basel framework, the rule includes a new minimum\nratio of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, or CET1, to\nRisk-\nWeighted Assets, or\nRWA,\nof 4.5% and a CET1 conservation buffer of 2.5% of\nRWA\n(which was fully phased-in in 2019) that\napply to all supervised financial institutions.\nThe CET1 conservation buffer requirement requires\nus to hold additional CET1\ncapital in excess of the minimum required to meet the CET1 to\nRWA\nratio requirement. The rule also, among other things, raised\nthe minimum ratio of Tier 1 Capital to\nRWA\nfrom 4% to 6% and included a minimum leverage ratio of 4% for all banking\norganizations. The impact of the new capital rules requires\nus to maintain higher levels of capital, which we expect will lower our\nreturn on equity.\nAdditionally, if our CET1 to\nRWA\nratio does not exceed the minimum required plus the additional CET1\nconservation buffer,\nwe may be restricted in our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions of capital to our\nshareowners.\nFurther changes to and compliance with the regulatory capital and liquidity\nrequirements may impact our operations by requiring\nus to liquidate assets, increase borrowings, issue additional equity or other\nsecurities, cease or alter certain operations, sell\ncompany assets or hold highly liquid assets, which may adversely affect\nour results of operations. We\nmay be prohibited from\ntaking capital actions such as paying or increasing dividends or repurchasing\nsecurities.\nChanges in accounting standards or assumptions in applying accounting\npolicies could adversely affect us.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record\nand report our financial condition and results of\noperations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions\nthat may affect the reported value of our assets or\nliabilities and results of operations and are critical because they require management\nto make difficult, subjective and complex\njudgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. If those assumptions,\nestimates or judgments were incorrectly made, we\ncould be required to correct and restate prior-period financial statements. Accounting\nstandard-setters and those who interpret the\naccounting standards, the SEC, banking regulators and our independent\nregistered public accounting firm may also amend or even\nreverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various standards\nshould be applied. These changes may be difficult to\npredict and could impact how we prepare and report our financial statements. In\nsome cases, we could be required to apply a new\nor revised standard retrospectively,\nresulting in us revising prior-period financial statements.\nFlorida financial institutions, such as CCB, face a higher risk of noncompliance\nand enforcement actions with the Bank\nSecrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nSince September 11, 2001, banking regulators\nhave intensified their focus on anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act\ncompliance requirements, particularly the anti-money laundering\nprovisions of the USA PATRIOT\nAct. There is also increased\nscrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign\nAssets Control, or OFAC. Since 2004,\nfederal banking\nregulators and examiners have been extremely aggressive in their supervision\nand examination of financial institutions located in\nthe State of Florida with respect to the institution\u2019s\nBank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering compliance. Consequently,\nnumerous formal enforcement actions have been instituted against financial\ninstitutions. If CCB\u2019s policies, procedures\nand\nsystems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of\nthe financial institutions that it has already acquired or\nmay acquire in the future are deficient, CCB would be subject to liability,\nincluding fines and regulatory actions such as\nrestrictions on its ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory\napprovals to proceed\nwith certain aspects of its\nbusiness plan, including its acquisition plans.\nFee revenues from overdraft protection\nprograms constitute a significant portion of our noninterest income\nand may be\nsubject to increased supervisory scrutiny.\nRevenues derived from transaction fees associated with overdraft protection\nprograms offered to our customers represent a\nsignificant portion of our noninterest income. In 2021, the Company\ncollected approximately $9.9 million in net overdraft\ntransaction fees. In recent months, certain members of Congress and\nthe leadership of the CFPB have expressed a heightened\ninterest in bank overdraft protection programs. In December 2021,\nthe CFPB published a report providing data on banks\u2019\noverdraft and non-sufficient funds fee revenues as well as observations\nregarding consumer protection issues relating to\nparticipation in such programs. The CFPB has indicated that it intends to\npursue enforcement actions against banking\norganizations, and their executives, that oversee\noverdraft practices that are deemed to be unlawful. In addition, the Comptroller\nof the Currency has identified potential options for reform of national\nbank overdraft protection practices, including providing a\ngrace period before the imposition of a fee, refraining from charging\nmultiple fees in a single day and eliminating fees altogether.\nIn response to this increased congressional and regulatory scrutiny,\nand in anticipation of enhanced supervision and enforcement\nof overdraft protection practices in the future, certain banking organizations\nhave begun to modify their overdraft protection\nprograms, including by discontinuing the imposition of overdraft transaction\nfees. These competitive pressures from our peers, as\nwell as any adoption by our regulators of new rules or supervisory guidance\nor more aggressive examination and enforcement\npolicies in respect of banks\u2019 overdraft protection practices, could cause\nus to modify our program and practices in ways that may\nhave a negative impact on our revenue and earnings, which, in turn, could\nhave an adverse effect on our financial condition and\nresults of operations. In addition, as supervisory expectations and industry\npractices regarding overdraft\nOperational Risks\nMany types of operational risks can affect our earnings negatively.\nWe regularly\nassess and monitor operational risk in our businesses. Despite our efforts\nto assess and monitor operational risk, our\nrisk management framework may not be effective in\nall cases. Factors that can impact operations and expose us to risks varying in\nsize, scale and scope include:\n\u25cf\nfailures of technological systems or breaches of security measures, including,\nbut not limited to, those resulting from\ncomputer viruses or cyber-attacks;\n\u25cf\nunsuccessful or difficult implementation of computer\nsystems upgrades;\n\u25cf\nhuman errors or omissions, including failures to comply with applicable\nlaws or corporate policies and procedures;\n\u25cf\ntheft, fraud or misappropriation of assets, whether arising from the intentional\nactions of internal personnel or external\nthird parties;\n\u25cf\nbreakdowns in processes, breakdowns in internal controls or failures\nof the systems and facilities that support our\noperations;\n\u25cf\ndeficiencies in services or service delivery;\n\u25cf\nnegative developments in relationships with key counterparties, third-party\nvendors, or employees in our day-to-day\noperations; and\n\u25cf\nexternal events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such\nas pandemics, geopolitical events, political unrest,\nnatural disasters or acts of terrorism.\nWhile we have in place many controls and business continuity plans designed\nto address these factors and others, these plans may\nnot operate successfully to mitigate these risks effectively.\nIf our controls and business continuity plans do not mitigate the\nassociated risks successfully,\nsuch factors may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition\nor results of\noperations. In addition, an important aspect of managing our operational\nrisk is creating a risk culture in which all employees\nfully understand that there is risk in every aspect of our business and the\nimportance of managing risk as it relates to their job\nfunctions. We\ncontinue to enhance our risk management program to support our risk culture. Nonetheless,\nif we fail to provide the\nappropriate environment that sensitizes all of our employees to managing\nrisk, our business could be impacted adversely.\nWe are subject to\ncertain operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer,\nemployee or third-party fraud and\ndata processing system failures and errors.\nWe rely on\nthe ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational\nrisk is the risk of loss\nresulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of\nfraud by employees or persons outside our company,\nthe\nexecution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating\nto transaction processing and technology,\nbreaches of our\ninternal control systems and compliance requirements. Insurance coverage\nmay not be available for such losses, or where\navailable, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes\nthe potential legal actions that could arise as a\nresult of operational deficiencies or as a result of non-compliance with applicable\nregulatory standards, adverse business decisions\nor their implementation, or customer attrition due to potential negative\npublicity. In the event of a breakdown\nin our internal\ncontrol systems, improper operation of systems or improper employee\nactions, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory\naction, and/or suffer damage to our reputation.\nPandemics, natural disasters, global climate change, acts of\nterrorism and global conflicts may have a negative impact\non\nour business and operations.\nPandemics, including the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, natural\ndisasters, global climate change, acts of terrorism, global\nconflicts or other similar events have in the past, and may in the future have,\na negative impact on our business and operations.\nThese events impact us negatively to the extent that they result in reduced capital\nmarkets activity, lower asset price\nlevels, or\ndisruptions in general economic activity in the United States or abroad,\nor in financial market settlement functions. In addition,\nthese or similar events may impact economic growth negatively,\nwhich could have an adverse effect on our business and\noperations and may have other adverse effects on us in\nways that we are unable to predict.\nOur business operations could be disrupted if significant portions of\nour workforce were unable to work effectively,\nincluding\nbecause of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions\nin connection with the pandemic. Further,\nwork-from-\nhome and other modified business practices may introduce additional\noperational risks, including cybersecurity and execution\nrisks, which may result in inefficiencies or delays, and may affect\nour ability to, or the manner in which we, conduct our business\nactivities. Disruptions to our clients could result in increased risk of\ndelinquencies, defaults, foreclosures and losses on our loans.\nThe escalation of the pandemic may also negatively impact regional economic\nconditions for a period of time, resulting in\ndeclines in local loan demand, liquidity of loan guarantors, loan collateral\n(particularly in real estate), loan originations and\ndeposit availability.\nLitigation may adversely affect our results.\nWe are subject\nto litigation in the ordinary course of business. Claims and legal actions, including\nsupervisory actions by our\nregulators, could involve large monetary claims and significant\ndefense costs. The outcome of litigation and regulatory matters as\nwell as the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult\nto predict.\nActual legal and other costs of resolving claims may be greater than\nour legal reserves. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal\nproceeding, depending on the remedy sought and granted,\ncould materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nIn addition, governmental authorities have, at times, sought criminal\npenalties against companies in the financial services sector\nfor violations, and, at times, have required an admission of wrongdoing\nfrom financial institutions in connection with resolving\nsuch matters. Criminal convictions or admissions of wrongdoing in\na settlement with the government can lead to greater exposure\nin civil litigation and reputational harm.\nSubstantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could\nhave material adverse financial effects or cause\nsignificant reputational harm, which adversely impact our business prospects.\nFurther, we may be exposed to substantial\nuninsured liabilities, which could adversely affect\nour results of operations and financial condition.\nStrategic Risks\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively\nin the highly competitive banking industry.\nWe face vigorous\ncompetition for deposits, loans and other financial services in our market area\nfrom other banks and financial\ninstitutions, including savings and loan associations, savings banks,\nfinance companies and credit unions. A number of our\ncompetitors are significantly larger than we are and have greater\naccess to capital and other resources. Many of our competitors\nalso have higher lending limits, more expansive branch networks, and\noffer a wider array of financial products and services. To\na\nlesser extent, we also compete with other providers of financial services, such\nas money market mutual funds, brokerage firms,\nconsumer finance companies, insurance companies and gov\nernmental organizations, which may offer financial\nproducts and\nservices on more favorable terms than we are able to. Many of our non-bank\ncompetitors are not subject to the same extensive\nregulations that govern our activities. As a result, these non-bank competitors have\nadvantages over us in providing certain\nservices. The effect of this competition may reduce or\nlimit our margins or our market share and may adversely affect\nour results\nof operations and financial condition.\nOur directors, executive officers, and principal shareowners,\nif acting together,\nhave substantial control over all matters\nrequiring shareowner approval,\nincluding changes of control. Because Mr.\nWilliam G. Smith, Jr.\nis a principal\nshareowner and our Chairman, President, and Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chairman of CCB, he has substantial\ncontrol\nover all matters on a day-to-day basis.\nOur directors, executive officers, and principal shareowners\nbeneficially owned approximately 23.7%\nof the outstanding shares of\nour common stock at December 31, 2021.\nWilliam G. Smith, Jr.,\nour Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nbeneficially owned 17.2% of our shares as of that date.\nAccordingly, these directors, executive\nofficers, and principal\nshareowners, if acting together, may\nbe able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our shareowners,\nincluding the\nelection of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions\nor other extraordinary transactions. Moreover,\nbecause William G.\nSmith, Jr. is the Chairman, President,\nand Chief Executive Officer of CCBG and Chairman of CCB, he has substantial\ncontrol\nover all matters on a day-to-day basis, including the nomination and election\nof directors.\nThese directors, executive officers, and principal\nshareowners may also have interests that differ from yours and may\nvote in a\nway with which you disagree, and which may be adverse to your interests. The\nconcentration of ownership may have the effect of\ndelaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company,\ncould deprive our shareowners of an opportunity to receive\na premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our Company and might\nultimately affect the market price of our common\nstock. You\nmay also have difficulty changing management, the composition\nof the Board of Directors, or the general direction of\nour Company.\nOur Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, and certain laws and regulations\nmay prevent or delay transactions you might\nfavor,\nincluding a sale or merger of CCBG.\nCCBG is registered with the Federal Reserve as a financial holding\ncompany under the Bank Holding Company Act, or BHC Act.\nAs a result, we are subject to supervisory regulation and examination\nby the Federal Reserve. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the\nBHC Act, and other federal laws subject financial holding companies\nto particular restrictions on the types of activities in which\nthey may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including\nregulatory enforcement actions for\nviolations of laws and regulations.\nProvisions of our Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, certain laws and\nregulations and various other factors may make it more\ndifficult and expensive for companies or persons to acquire control\nof us without the consent of our Board of Directors. It is\npossible, however, that you would want\na takeover attempt to succeed because, for example, a potential buyer could offer\na\npremium over the then prevailing price of our common stock.\nFor example, our Articles of Incorporation permit our Board of Directors\nto issue preferred stock without shareowner action. The\nability to issue preferred stock could discourage a company from\nattempting to obtain control of us by means of a tender offer,\nmerger, proxy contest or\notherwise. We are also subject\nto certain provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act and our\nArticles of Incorporation that relate to business combinations with interested\nshareowners. Other provisions in our Articles of\nIncorporation or Bylaws that may discourage takeover attempts or make them\nmore difficult include:\n\u25cf\nSupermajority voting requirements to remove a director from office;\n\u25cf\nProvisions regarding the timing and content of shareowner proposals\nand nominations;\n\u25cf\nSupermajority voting requirements to amend Articles of Incorporation\nunless approval is received by a majority of\n\u201cdisinterested directors\u201d;\n\u25cf\nAbsence of cumulative voting; and\n\u25cf\nInability for shareowners to take action by written consent.\nReputational Risks\nDamage to our reputation could harm our businesses, including\nour competitive position and business prospects.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors and employees\nis impacted by our reputation. Harm to our reputation\ncan arise from various sources, including officer,\ndirector or employee fraud, misconduct and unethical behavior,\nsecurity\nbreaches, litigation or regulatory outcomes, compensation practices, lending\npractices, the suitability or reasonableness of\nrecommending particular trading or investment strategies,\nincluding the reliability of our research and models, prohibiting clients\nfrom engaging in certain transactions and employee sales practices. Additionally,\nour reputation may be harmed by failing to\ndeliver products, subpar standards of service and quality expected by\nour customers, clients and the community,\ncompliance\nfailures, the inability to manage technology change or maintain effective\ndata management, cyber incidents, internal and external\nfraud, inadequacy of responsiveness to internal controls, unintended\ndisclosure of personal, proprietary or confidential\ninformation, conflicts of interest and breach of fiduciary obligations,\nthe handling of health emergencies or pandemics, and the\nactivities of our clients, customers, counterparties and third parties, including\nvendors. Our reputation may also be negatively\nimpacted by our environmental, social, and governance practices and\ndisclosures,\nour businesses and our customers, including\npractices and disclosures related to climate change. Actions by the financial\nservices industry generally or by certain members or\nindividuals in the industry also can adversely affect our reputation.\nIn addition, adverse publicity or negative information posted\non social media by employees, the media or otherwise, whether or not\nfactually correct, may adversely impact our business\nprospects or financial results.\nWe are subject\nto complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy,\nknow-your-customer requirements, data\nprotection, cross-border data movement and other matters. Principles\nconcerning the appropriate scope of consumer and\ncommercial privacy vary considerably in different\njurisdictions, and regulatory and public expectations regarding the definition\nand scope of consumer and commercial privacy may remain fluid.\nIt is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied by\nvarious jurisdictions in a manner inconsistent with our current or future practices,\nor that is inconsistent with one another.\nIf\npersonal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or\nclients in our possession, or in the possession of third parties\n(including their downstream service providers) or financial data aggregators,\nis mishandled, misused or mismanaged, or if we do\nnot timely or adequately address such information, we may face regulatory,\nreputational and operational risks which could\nadversely affect our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe could\nsuffer reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage\npotential conflicts of interest. Management of\npotential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand\nour business activities through more numerous\ntransactions, obligations and interests with and among our clients. The failure\nto adequately address, or the perceived failure to\nadequately address, conflicts of interest could affect the\nwillingness of clients to use our products and services, or give rise to\nlitigation or enforcement actions, which could adversely affect\nour business.\nOur actual or perceived failure to address these and other issues, such\nas operational risks, gives rise to reputational risk that could\nharm us and our business prospects. Failure to appropriately address\nany of these issues could also give rise to additional\nregulatory restrictions, legal risks and reputational harm,\nwhich could, among other consequences, increase the size and number\nof litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement\nactions, fines and penalties, and cause us to incur related\ncosts and expenses.\nTechnology\nRisks\nWe process, maintain,\nand transmit confidential client information through\nour information technology systems, such as\nour online banking service.\nCybersecurity issues, such as security breaches and computer viruses,\naffecting our\ninformation technology systems or fraud related\nto our debit card products could disrupt our business, result in the\nunintended disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary\ninformation, damage our reputation, increase our\ncosts,\nand cause losses.\nWe collect and\nstore sensitive data, including our proprietary business\ninformation and that of our clients, and personally\nidentifiable information of our clients and employees, in our\ninformation technology systems\n.\nWe also provide\nour clients the\nability to bank online.\nThe secure processing, maintenance, and transmission of this information\nis critical to our operations.\nOur\nnetwork, or those of our clients, could be vulnerable to unauthorized\naccess, computer\nviruses, phishing schemes and other\nsecurity problems.\nFinancial institutions and companies engaged in data processing have\nincreasingly reported breaches in the\nsecurity of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated\nand targeted attacks intended to obtain\nunauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt\nor degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage.\nWe may be\nrequired to spend significant capital and other resources to protect\nagainst the threat of security breaches and\ncomputer viruses or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches\nor viruses. Security breaches and viruses could expose us to\nclaims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent\nsecurity breaches or computer viruses could also cause\nexisting clients to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely\naffect our reputation and our ability to generate deposits.\nAdditionally, fraud\nlosses related to debit and credit cards have risen in recent years due in large part\nto growing and evolving\nschemes to illegally use cards or steal consumer credit card information\ndespite risk management practices employed by the debit\nand credit card industries. Many issuers of debit and credit cards have suffered\nsignificant losses in recent years due to the theft of\ncardholder data that has been illegally exploited for personal gain.\nThe potential for debit and credit card fraud against us or our clients and our third-party\nservice providers is a serious issue. Debit\nand credit card fraud is pervasive, and the risks of cybercrime are complex\nand continue to evolve. In view of the recent high-\nprofile retail data breaches involving client personal and financial information,\nthe potential impact on us and any exposure to\nconsumer losses and the cost of technology investments to improve security\ncould cause losses to us or our clients, damage to our\nbrand, and an increase in our costs.", "PERMNO": 84516, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CCBG"}
