RISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS Back to Table of Contents\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis annual report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, the market in which we operate, our beliefs and our Management\u2019s assumptions. In addition, other written or oral statements that constitute forward-looking statements may be made by us or on our behalf. Words such as \u201cexpects\u201d, \u201canticipates\u201d, \u201ctargets\u201d, \u201cgoals\u201d, \u201cprojects\u201d, \u201cintends\u201d, \u201cplans\u201d, \u201cbelieves\u201d, \u201cseeks\u201d, \u201cestimates\u201d, variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or assess. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forward-looking statements.\nAny investment in our shares of common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following information about these risks, together with the other information contained in this annual report before you decide to invest in our common stock. Each of the following risks may materially and adversely affect our business objective, plan of operation and financial condition. These risks may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, which may cause you to lose all or a part of the money you invested in our common stock. We provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business plan. In addition to other information included in this annual report, the following factors should be considered in evaluating the Company\u2019s business and future prospects.\nThe Company has a limited operating history and very limited resources.\nSince emerging from bankruptcy, the Company\u2019s operations have been limited to seeking a potential business combination and has had no revenues from operations. Investors will have no basis upon which to evaluate the Company\u2019s ability to achieve the Company\u2019s business objective, which is to effect a merger, capital stock exchange and/or acquire an operating business. The Company will not generate any revenues until, at the earliest, after the consummation of a business combination or acquiring an operating business.\nOur auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs of June 30, 2020, we had no cash and cash equivalents and an accumulated deficit of $276,236. Our audited financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2020, were prepared using the assumption that we will continue our operations as a going concern. Our independent accountants in their audit report have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our operations are dependent on our ability to raise sufficient capital or complete business combination as a result of which we become profitable. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nThere is not enough cash on hand to fund our administrative expenses and operating expenses for the next twelve months. Therefore, we may be unable to continue operations in the future as a going concern. If we cannot continue as a viable entity, our stockholders may lose some or all of their investment in the Company\u2019s shares of common stock.\nSince the Company has not yet selected a particular target industry or target business with which to complete a business combination, the Company is unable to ascertain the merits or risks associated with any particular business or industry.\nSince the Company has not yet identified a particular industry or prospective target business, there is no basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business which the Company may ultimately acquire. If the Company completes a business combination with a financially unstable company or an entity in its development stage, the Company may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the operations of those entities. Although the Company\u2019s Management intends to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular industry or target business, the Company cannot assure you that it will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. There can be no assurance that any prospective business combination will benefit shareholders or prove to be more favorable to shareholders than any other investment that may be made by shareholders and investors.\nUnspecified and unascertainable risks\nThere is no basis for shareholders to evaluate the possible merits or risks of potential business combination. To the extent that the Company effects a business combination with a financially unstable operating company or an entity that is in its early stage of development or growth, the Company will become subject to numerous risks. If the Company effects a business combination with an entity in a high-risk industry, the Company will become subject to the currently unascertainable risks of that industry. Although Management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular business or industry, there can be no assurance that Management will properly ascertain or assess all such risks that the Company perceived at the time of the consummation of a business combination.\nIt is likely that the Company\u2019s current sole officer and director will resign upon consummation of a business combination and the Company will have only limited ability to evaluate the Management of the target business.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to successfully effect a business combination will be dependent upon the efforts of the Company\u2019s Management. The future role of Management in the target business cannot presently be ascertained. Although it is possible that Management may remain associated with the target business following a business combination, it is likely that the Management of the target business will remain in place. Although the Company intends to closely scrutinize the management of a target business in connection with evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination, the Company cannot assure you that the Company\u2019s assessment of Management will prove to be correct.\nDependence on key personnel\nThe Company is dependent upon the continued services of Management. To the extent that his services become unavailable, the Company will be required to obtain other qualified personnel and there can be no assurance that it will be able to recruit qualified persons upon acceptable terms.\nThe Company\u2019s sole officer and director may allocate his time to other businesses activities, thereby causing conflicts of interest as to how much time to devote to the Company\u2019s affairs. This could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s ability to consummate a business combination in a timely manner, if at all.\nThe Company\u2019s officer and director is not required to commit his full time to the Company\u2019s affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating his time between the Company\u2019s business and other businesses. The Company does not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination. Management of the Company is engaged in other business endeavors and is not obligated to contribute any specific number of his hours per week to the Company\u2019s affairs. Mr. Heiden owes fiduciary duty to Baltic Capital Corp. of which he is the sole officer and director.\nIf Management\u2019s other business affairs require him to devote more time to such affairs, it could limit his ability to devote time to the Company\u2019s affairs and could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s ability to consummate a business combination. Furthermore, we do not have an employment agreement with Mr. Heiden. Mr. Heiden has no formal obligation or commitment to provide any particular amount of time to the Company\u2019s affairs.\nThe Company may be unable to obtain additional financing, if and when required, to complete a business combination or to fund the operations and growth of the business combination target, which could compel the Company to restructure a potential business combination transaction or to entirely abandon a particular business combination.\nThe Company has not yet identified any prospective target business. If we require funds for a particular business combination, because of the size of the business combination or otherwise, we will be required to seek additional financing, which may or may not be available a terms and conditions satisfactory to the Company, if at all. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when and if needed to consummate a particular business combination, we would be compelled to restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. In addition, if we consummate a business combination, we may require additional financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. The Company\u2019s officer, director or stockholders are not required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after a business combination.\nIt is probable that the Company will only be able to enter into one business combination, which will cause us to be solely dependent on such single business and a limited number of products or services.\nIt is probable that the Company will enter into a business combination with a single operating business. Accordingly, the prospects for the Company\u2019s success may be:\n\u25cf solely dependent upon the performance of a single operating business, or\n\u25cf dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products or services.\nIn this case, the Company will not be able to diversify the Company\u2019s operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry.\nThe Company has limited resources and there is significant competition for business combination opportunities. Therefore, the Company may not be able to enter into or consummate an attractive business combination.\nThe Company expects to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to the Company\u2019s, including venture capital funds, leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses competing for acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than the Company does and the Company\u2019s financial resources are limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While the Company believes that there are numerous potential target businesses that it could acquire, the Company\u2019s ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses will be limited by the Company\u2019s limited financial resources and the fact that the Company will use its common stock to acquire an operating business. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses.\nThe Company may be unable to obtain additional financing, if required, to complete a business combination or to fund the operations and growth of the target business, which could compel the Company to restructure a potential business transaction or abandon a particular business combination.\nWe may be required to seek additional financing. We cannot assure you that such financing would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If additional financing proves to be unavailable, we would be compelled to restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business. In addition, if we consummate a business combination, we may require additional financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business.\nFinancing requirements to fund operations associated with reporting obligations under the Exchange Act.\nThe Company has no revenues and is dependent upon the willingness of the Company\u2019s Management to fund the costs associated with the reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, other administrative costs associated with the Company\u2019s corporate existence and expenses related to the Company\u2019s business objective. The Company is not likely to generate any revenues until the consummation of a business combination, at the earliest. The Company believes that it will have available sufficient financial resources available from its Management to continue to pay accounting and other professional fees and other miscellaneous expenses that may be required until the Company commences business operations following a business combination.\nWe are dependent upon interim funding provided by Management or an affiliated party to pay professional fees and expenses. Our Management has provided funding, without formal agreement, as has been required to pay for accounting fees and other administrative expenses of the Company.\nThe Company does not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow. The costs of investigating and analyzing potential business combination candidates and preparing and filing Exchange Act reports for what may be an unlimited period of time will be paid by our sole officer and director, or an affiliated party notwithstanding the fact that there is no written agreement to pay such costs. The Company intends to repay these advances when it has the cash resources to do so.\nBased on our CEO\u2019s resource commitment to fund our operations, we believe that we will be able to continue as a going concern until such time as we conclude a business combination. During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring costs related to:\n\u25cf filing of Exchange Act reports.\n\u25cf franchise fees, registered agent fees and accounting fees, and\n\u25cf investigating, analyzing and consummating an acquisition or business combination.\nWe estimate that these costs will range from five to ten thousand dollars per year, and that we will be able to meet these costs as necessary through loans/advances from Management or affiliated parties until we enter into a business combination.\nThe Company\u2019s sole officer and director has a 55.56% equity interest in the Company and thus is in a position to influence certain actions requiring stockholder vote.\nManagement has no present intention to call for an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the consummation of a business combination. As a result, our current director will continue in office at least until the consummation of the business combination. If there is an annual meeting of stockholders for any reason, the Company\u2019s Management has broad discretion regarding proposals submitted to a vote by shareholders as a consequence of Management\u2019s significant equity interest. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s Management will continue to exert substantial control at least until the consummation of a business combination.\nBroad discretion of Management\nAny person who invests in the Company\u2019s common stock will do so without an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any prospective business combination. As a result, investors will be entirely dependent on the broad discretion and judgment of Management in connection with the selection of a prospective business combination. There can be no assurance that determinations made by the Company\u2019s Management will permit us to achieve the Company\u2019s business objectives.\nReporting requirements may delay or preclude a business combination\nPursuant to the requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange Act, the Company is required to provide certain information about significant acquisitions and other material events. The Company will continue to be required to file quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K, which annual report must contain the Company\u2019s audited financial statements. As a reporting company under the Exchange Act, following any business combination, we will be required to file a report on Form 8-K, which report contains audited financial statements of the acquired entity. These audited financial statements must be filed with the SEC within 5 days following the closing of a business combination. While obtaining audited financial statements is typically the responsibility of the acquired company, it is possible that a potential target company may be a non-reporting company with unaudited financial statements. The time and costs that may be incurred by some potential target companies to prepare such audited financial statements may significantly delay or may even preclude consummation of an otherwise desirable business combination. Acquisition prospects that do not have or are unable to obtain the required audited statements may not be appropriate for acquisition because we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.\nIf the Company is deemed to be an investment company, the Company may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and the Company\u2019s activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for the Company to enter into a business combination.\n\u25cf restrictions on the nature of the Company\u2019s investments; and\n\u25cf restrictions on the issuance of securities, which may make it difficult for us to complete a business combination.\nIn addition, we may have imposed upon us burdensome requirements, including:\n\u25cf registration as an investment company;\n\u25cf adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and\n\u25cf reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations.\nThe Company does not believe that its anticipated principal activities will subject it to the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nThe Company may be deemed to have no \u201cIndependent Director\u201d, actions taken and expenses incurred by our officer and director on behalf of the Company will generally not be subject to \u201cIndependent Review\u201d.\nOur director owns shares of our common stock and, although no compensation will be paid to him for services rendered prior to or in connection with a business combination, he may receive reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by him in connection with activities on the Company\u2019s behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. There is no limit on the amount of these out-of-pocket expenses and there will be no review of the reasonableness of the expenses by anyone other than our board of director, which consist of one director who may seek reimbursement. If our director will not be deemed \u201cindependent,\u201d he will generally not have the benefit of independent director examining the propriety of expenses incurred on our behalf and subject to reimbursement. Although the Company believes that all actions taken by our director on the Company\u2019s behalf will be in the Company\u2019s best interests, the Company cannot assure the investor that this will actually be the case. If actions are taken, or expenses are incurred that are actually not in the Company\u2019s best interests, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and plan of operation and the price of our stock held by the public stockholders.\nGeneral Economic Risks.\nThe Company\u2019s current and future business objectives and plan of operation are likely dependent, in large part, on the state of the general economy. Adverse changes in economic conditions may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business objective and plan of operation. These conditions and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control include also, but are not limited to regulatory changes.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe Company\u2019s shares of common stock are traded from time to time on the OTC Pink Sheet Market.\nOur common stock trades from time to time on the OTC Pink Sheet Market. As a result, there is only limited liquidity in our common stock. We plan to seek quotation of our common stock on the OTCQB Market. Quotation of the Company\u2019s securities on the OTCQB market limits the liquidity and price of the Company\u2019s common stock more than if the Company\u2019s shares of common stock were listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market or a national exchange. In order for our common stock to become subject to quotation on the OTCQB Market, we must obtain a market maker to file an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) on our behalf pursuant to Rule 15c2-11 under the Exchange Act. If we fail to continue to comply with the listing requirements of the OTCQB Market, the price of our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to satisfy the requirements of the OTCQB Markets\u2019 for continued quotation. There can be no assurance that there will be a liquid trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock following a business combination. In the event that a liquid trading market commences, there can be no assurance as to the market price of the Company\u2019s shares of common stock, whether any trading market will provide liquidity to investors, or whether any trading market will be sustained.\nOur common stock is subject to the Penny Stock Rules of the SEC and the trading market in our common stock is limited, which makes transactions in our stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our common stock.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 3a51-1 which establishes the definition of a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, Rule 15g-9 require:\n\u25cf that a broker or dealer approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks; and\n\u25cf the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must:\n\u25cf obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person; and\n\u25cf make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form:\n\u25cf sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and\n\u25cf that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.\nGenerally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock.\nDisclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nState blue sky registration; potential limitations on resale of the Company\u2019s common stock\nThe holders of the Company\u2019s shares of common stock registered under the Exchange Act and those persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that may develop in the future, should be aware that there may be state blue-sky law restrictions upon the ability of investors to resell the Company\u2019s securities. Accordingly, investors should consider the secondary market for the Registrant\u2019s securities to be a limited one.\nIt is the intention of the Registrant\u2019s Management following the consummation of a business combination to seek coverage and publication of information regarding the Registrant in an accepted publication manual which permits a manual exemption. The manual exemption permits a security to be distributed in a particular state without being registered if the Registrant issuing the security has a listing for that security in a securities manual recognized by the state. However, it is not enough for the security to be listed in a recognized manual. The listing entry must contain (1) the names of issuers, officers, and directors, (2) an issuer\u2019s balance sheet, and (3) a profit and loss statement for either the fiscal year preceding the balance sheet or for the most recent fiscal year of operations. Furthermore, the manual exemption is a non-issuer exemption restricted to secondary trading transactions, making it unavailable for issuers selling newly issued securities.\nMost of the accepted manuals are those published by Standard and Poor\u2019s, Moody\u2019s Investor Service, Fitch\u2019s Investment Service, and Best\u2019s Insurance Reports, and many states expressly recognize these manuals. A smaller number of states declare that they \u201crecognize securities manuals\u201d but do not specify the recognized manuals. The following states do not have any provisions and therefore do not expressly recognize the manual exemption: Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont and Wisconsin.\nRule 144 Related Risks\nThe SEC adopted amendments to Rule 144 which became effective on February 15, 2008. These Rule 144 amendments apply to securities acquired both before and after that date. Generally, under the Rule 144 amendments, a person who has beneficially owned restricted shares for at least six months would be entitled to sell their securities provided that: (i) such person is not deemed to have been an affiliate at the time of, or at any time during the three months preceding, a sale; (ii) we are subject to and are current in the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements for at least 90 days before the sale; and (iii) if the sale occurs prior to satisfaction of a one-year holding period, provided current information is available at the time of sale.\nPersons who have beneficially owned restricted shares for at least six months but who are affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the three months preceding a sale, would be subject to additional restrictions, by which such person would be entitled to sell within any three-month period only a number of securities that does not exceed the greater of either of the following: (i) 1% of the total number of securities of the same class then outstanding; or (ii) the average weekly trading volume of such securities during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to the sale; provided, in each case, that we are subject to the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements for at least three months before the sale. Such sales by affiliates must also comply with the manner of sale, current public information and notice provisions of Rule 144.\nThese Rule 144 related risks are subject to further restrictions in the event that the Exchange Act reporting company is deemed to be a Shell Company, such as the Registrant.\nRestrictions on the Reliance of Rule 144 by Shell Companies or Former Shell Companies\nHistorically, the SEC staff has taken the position that Rule 144 is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by companies that are, or previously were, blank check companies, like us. The SEC has codified and expanded this position in the amendments discussed above by prohibiting the use of Rule 144 for resale of securities issued by any shell companies (other than business combination related shell companies) or any issuer that has been at any time previously a shell company. The SEC has provided an important exception to this prohibition, however, if the following conditions are met:\n\u25cf The issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company;\n\u25cf The issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act;\n\u25cf The issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Current Reports on Form 8-K; and\n\u25cf At least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current comprehensive disclosure with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company.\nAs a result, it is likely that pursuant to Rule 144, stockholders who receive our restricted securities in a business combination will not be able to sell our shares without registration until one year after we have completed our initial business combination.\nRule 145 Related Risk\nUnder the new amendments, affiliates of a target company who receive registered shares in a Rule 145 business combination transaction, and who do not become affiliates of the acquirer, will be able to immediately resell the securities received by them into the public markets without registration (except for affiliates of a shell company as discussed in the following section). However, those persons who are affiliates of the acquirer, and those who become affiliates of the acquirer after the acquisition, will still be subject to the Rule 144 resale conditions generally applicable to affiliates, including the adequate current public information requirement, volume limitations, manner-of-sale requirements for equity securities, and, if applicable, a Form 144 filing.\nApplication of Rule 145 to Shell Companies\nPublic resale of securities acquired by affiliates of acquirers and target companies in business combination transactions involving shell companies will continue to be subject to restrictions imposed by Rule 145. If the business combination transaction is not registered under the Securities Act, then the affiliates must look to Rule 144 to resell their securities (with the additional Rule 144 conditions applicable to shell company securities). If the business combination transaction is registered under the Securities Act, then affiliates of the acquirer and target company may resell the securities acquired in the transaction, subject to the following conditions:\n\u25cf The issuer must meet all of the conditions applicable to shell companies under Rule 144;\n\u25cf After 90 days from the date of the acquisition, the affiliates may resell their securities subject to Rule 144\u2019s volume limitations, adequate current public information requirement, and manner-of-sale requirements;\n\u25cf After six months from the date of the acquisition, selling security-holders who are not affiliates of the acquirer may resell their securities subject only to the adequate current public information requirement of Rule 144; and\n\u25cf After one year from the date of the acquisition, selling security-holders who are not affiliates or the acquirer may resell their securities without restriction.\nApplication of Rule 419 to Shell Companies\nThe provisions of Rule 419 apply to registration statements filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, by a blank check company. Rule 419 requires that a blank check company filing such registration statement deposit the securities being offered and proceeds of the offering into an escrow or trust account pending the execution of an agreement for an acquisition or merger.\nIn addition, the registrant is required to file a post-effective amendment to the registration statement upon the execution of an agreement for such acquisition or merger. The rule provides procedures for the release of the offering funds in conjunction with the post effective acquisition or merger. The obligations to file post-effective amendments are in addition to the obligations to file Forms 8-K to report for both the entry into a material non-ordinary course agreement and the completion of the transaction. Rule 419 applies to both primary and re-sale or secondary offerings.\nWithin five (5) days of filing a post-effective amendment setting forth the proposed terms of an acquisition, the Company must notify each investor whose shares are in escrow. Each investor then has no fewer than 20 and no greater than 45 business days to notify the Company in writing if they elect to remain an investor. A failure to reply indicates that the person has elected to not remain an investor. As all investors are allotted this second opportunity to determine to remain an investor, acquisition agreements should be conditioned upon enough funds remaining in escrow to close the transaction.\nYou May Not Be Entitled to Protections Normally Afforded to Investors of Bank Check Companies.\nIf the net proceeds of an offering under the Securities Act of 1933 is used to complete an initial business combination with a target business that has not been identified, and we will have net tangible assets in excess of $5,000,001 upon the successful consummation of this offering and will file a Current Report on Form 8-K, including an audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors of blank check companies such as Rule 419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules which would, for example, completely restrict the transferability of our securities, require us to complete our initial business combination within 18 months of the effective date of the initial registration statement and restrict the use of interest earned on the funds held in the trust account.\nInvestors will then not be entitled to protections normally offered to investors in Rule 419 blank check offerings.\nPossible Issuance of Additional Securities.\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 74,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001. As of June 30, 2020, we had 23,811,750 shares issued and outstanding. We may be expected to issue additional shares in connection with our pursuit of new business opportunities and new business operations. To the extent that additional shares of common stock are issued, our shareholders would experience dilution of their respective ownership interests. If we issue shares of common stock in connection with our intent to pursue new business opportunities, a change in control of the Registrant may be expected to occur. The issuance of additional shares of common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, in the event that an active trading market commences.\nDividends unlikely\nThe Company does not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future because it has no revenues or cash resources. The payment of dividends will be contingent upon the Company\u2019s future revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and overall financial conditions. The payment of any future dividends will be within the discretion of the Company\u2019s board of directors as then constituted. It is the Company\u2019s expectation that future Management following a business combination will determine to retain any earnings for use in its business operations and accordingly, the Company does not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 84304, "SIC": 7200, "TIC": "ECMT"}
