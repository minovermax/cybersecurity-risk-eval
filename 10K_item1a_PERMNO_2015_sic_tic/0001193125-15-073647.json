Risk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the following information about the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report before you decide to buy or maintain an investment in our common stock or other securities. We believe the risks described below are the risks that are material to us as of the date of this Annual Report. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of may also become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock and other securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock or other securities.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe depend heavily on the successful commercialization of our only approved product, AFREZZA.\nWe have expended significant time, money and effort in the development of our only approved product, AFREZZA. We anticipate that in the near term, our ability to generate revenues will depend on the successful commercialization of AFREZZA. On August 11, 2014, we executed the Sanofi License Agreement, which became effective on September 23, 2014. Pursuant to the Sanofi License Agreement, Sanofi is responsible for global commercial, regulatory and development activities for AFREZZA and we are responsible for manufacturing AFREZZA at our facility in Danbury, Connecticut to supply Sanofi\u2019s demand for the product. On February 3, 2015, we and Sanofi announced that AFREZZA had become available by prescription in United States retail pharmacies. We and Sanofi must receive the necessary approvals from foreign regulatory agencies before AFREZZA can be marketed outside of the United States.\nEven with such regulatory approval, we and Sanofi, ultimately may be unable to gain market acceptance of AFREZZA for a variety of reasons, including the treatment and dosage regimen, potential adverse effects, the availability of alternative treatments and lack of coverage or adequate reimbursement. If we fail to commercialize AFREZZA successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have sought to develop our other product candidates through our internal research programs. All of our product candidates will require additional research and development and, in some cases, significant preclinical,\nclinical and other testing prior to seeking regulatory approval to market them. Accordingly, these product candidates will not be commercially available for a number of years, if at all.\nA significant portion of the research that we have conducted involves new technologies, including our Technosphere platform technology. Even if our research programs identify product candidates that initially show promise, these candidates may fail to progress to clinical development for any number of reasons, including discovery upon further research that these candidates have adverse effects or other characteristics that indicate they are unlikely to be effective. In addition, the clinical results we obtain at one stage are not necessarily indicative of future testing results. If we fail to develop and commercialize our other product candidates, or if we are significantly delayed in doing so, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed and the market price of our common stock and other securities could decline.\nWe are dependent on our collaboration with Sanofi to further develop and to commercialize AFREZZA worldwide. This collaboration places the development and commercialization largely outside our control, and poor performance under or failure to maintain the collaboration agreement between us and Sanofi could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our common stock and other securities could decline.\nWe entered into the Sanofi License Agreement to provide for the future development and commercialization of AFREZZA. We cannot be certain that our collaboration with Sanofi will continue for as long as there is a potential market for AFREZZA. Both we and Sanofi have certain rights to terminate the collaboration agreement, in certain circumstances, including a right by Sanofi to terminate the agreement upon specified prior written notice. If the agreement is terminated prior to the end of the commercial life of AFREZZA, we may not be able to find another collaborator for the development and commercialization of AFREZZA, and even if we elected to pursue further development and commercialization of AFREZZA on our own, we might not be able to do so successfully and would experience substantially increased capital requirements that we might not be able to fund. Our dependence on Sanofi and the Sanofi License Agreement subjects us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nSanofi may not perform as expected and we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that Sanofi may devote to the development or commercialization of AFREZZA; moreover, Sanofi may elect to prioritize its other insulin products over AFREZZA;\n\u2022\nwe and Sanofi could disagree as to commercialization and development plans and Sanofi may delay clinical trials or stop a clinical trial;\n\u2022\nthere may be disputes between us and Sanofi, including disagreements regarding the Sanofi License Agreement, that may result in (a) the delay of (or prevent entirely) the achievement of regulatory and commercial objectives that would result in milestone payments, (b) the delay or termination of the development or commercialization of AFREZZA, and/or (c) costly litigation or arbitration that diverts our management\u2019s attention and resources;\n\u2022\nSanofi may not comply with applicable regulatory guidelines with respect to the development or commercialization of AFREZZA, which could adversely impact the development of or sales of AFREZZA and could result in administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, product seizures or detention, product recalls, total or partial suspension of production and refusal to approve any new drug applications;\n\u2022\nSanofi may not provide us with timely and accurate information regarding sales activities and supply forecasts, which could adversely impact our ability to comply with our manufacturing and supply obligations under our supply agreement with Sanofi and our and Sanofi\u2019s ability to commercialize AFREZZA;\n\u2022\nSanofi may experience financial difficulties;\n\u2022\nbusiness combinations or significant changes in Sanofi\u2019s business strategy may also adversely affect Sanofi\u2019s ability to perform its obligations under the Sanofi License Agreement;\n\u2022\nSanofi may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation; and\n\u2022\nnotwithstanding the non-competition requirements in the Sanofi License Agreement, Sanofi could independently move forward with a competing product candidate developed either independently or in collaboration with others, including our competitors.\nAny failure of Sanofi to adequately perform its obligations under the Sanofi License Agreement or the termination of such agreement could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our common stock and other securities could decline.\nWe have a history of operating losses, we expect to continue to incur losses and we may never generate positive cash flow from operations.\nWe have never been profitable or generated positive cash flow from cumulative operations to date and, as of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $2.5 billion. The accumulated deficit has resulted principally from costs incurred in our research and development programs, the write-off of goodwill and general operating expenses. We expect to make substantial expenditures and to incur increasing operating losses in the future in order to support the commercialization of AFREZZA, including costs and expenses to manufacture AFREZZA on a commercial scale. In addition, we have agreed to purchase annual minimum quantities of insulin under the Insulin Supply Agreement with Amphastar in the aggregate of approximately \u0080120.1 million in calendar years 2015 through 2019. We may not have the necessary capital resources on hand in order to service this contractual commitment, and we may become obligated to make additional payments under the Insulin Supply Agreement in the event of its termination under certain scenarios. Our cumulative net loss may therefore increase significantly.\nTo date, we have received cash payments from Sanofi but have deferred revenue recognition of such payments. We will continue to defer revenue recognition of future milestone payments as and to the extent appropriate under applicable revenue recognition rules. Accordingly, even if we continue to earn and receive milestone payments, revenue recognition may continue to be deferred and our cumulative net loss may therefore be higher than it would be if we recognized the full amount of the milestone payments upon receipt.\nOur losses have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our working capital, total assets and stockholders\u2019 equity. As of December 31, 2014, we had stockholders\u2019 deficit of $73.8 million. Our ability to achieve and sustain positive cash flow from operations and profitability depends upon successfully commercializing AFREZZA in collaboration with Sanofi. We may not generate positive cash flow from operations or be profitable even if we succeed in commercializing any of our product candidates. As a result, we cannot be sure when we will generate positive cash flow from operations or become profitable, if at all.\nIn the future we may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations.\nIn the future, we may need to raise additional capital, whether through the sale of equity or debt securities, additional strategic business collaborations, the establishment of other funding facilities, licensing arrangements, asset sales or other means, in order to support our ongoing activities related to the commercialization of AFREZZA and the development of other product candidates. It may be difficult for us to raise additional funds on favorable terms, or at all. As of December 31, 2014, we had stockholders\u2019 deficit of $73.8 million, which may raise concerns about our solvency and affect our ability to raise additional capital. The extent of our additional funding requirements will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe election of any or all of the holders of our 5.75% Senior Convertible Notes due 2015 (the \u201c2015 notes\u201d), the 9.75% Senior Convertible Notes due 2019 issued to Deerfield Private Design Fund II, L.P. (\u201cDeerfield Private Design Fund\u201d) and Deerfield Private Design International II, L.P. (collectively, \u201cDeerfield\u201d) (the \u201c2019 notes\u201d) and the 8.75% Senior Convertible Notes due 2019 issued to Deerfield (the \u201cTranche B notes\u201d) to require us to repay or repurchase such debt securities if and when required;\n\u2022\nour ability to repay or refinance existing indebtedness, including indebtedness under the 2015 notes which mature in August 2015; and the extent to which the 2015 notes or any other convertible debt securities we may issue are converted into shares of our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe rate of progress and costs of our clinical studies and research and development activities;\n\u2022\nthe costs of procuring raw materials and operating our manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022\nour obligation to make milestone payments pursuant to the milestone rights issued to Deerfield Private Design Fund and Horizon Sant\u00e9 FLML S\u00c1RL and pursuant to the Milestone Rights Purchase Agreement dated July 1, 2013 (the \u201cMilestone Agreement\u201d);\n\u2022\nour obligation to bear our share of net losses under the Sanofi License Agreement;\n\u2022\nour success in establishing strategic business collaborations or other sales or licensing of assets, and the timing and amount of any payments we might receive from any such transactions;\n\u2022\nthe degree of success in commercializing AFREZZA;\n\u2022\nactions taken by the FDA and other regulatory authorities affecting AFREZZA and our product candidates and competitive products;\n\u2022\nthe emergence of competing technologies and products and other market developments;\n\u2022\nthe costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights or defending against claims of infringement by others;\n\u2022\nthe level of our legal and litigation expenses; and\n\u2022\nthe costs of discontinuing projects and technologies, and/or decommissioning existing facilities, if we undertake any such activities.\nWe have raised capital in the past through the sale of equity and debt securities and we may in the future pursue the sale of additional equity and/or debt securities, including sales of our common stock through our at-the-market sales agreements, or the establishment of other funding facilities including asset-based borrowings. There can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all. Issuances of additional debt or equity securities or the conversion of any of our currently outstanding convertible debt securities into shares of our common stock or the exercise of our currently outstanding warrants for shares of our common stock could impact the rights of the holders of our common stock and may dilute their ownership percentage. Moreover, the establishment of other funding facilities may impose restrictions on our operations. These restrictions could include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets, as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, redeem our stock or make investments. We also may seek to raise additional capital by pursuing opportunities for the licensing or sale of certain intellectual property and other assets. We cannot offer assurances, however, that any strategic collaborations, sales of securities or sales or licenses of assets will be available to us on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, if at all. We may be required to enter into relationships with third parties to develop or commercialize products or technologies that we otherwise would have sought to develop independently, and any such relationships may not be on terms as commercially favorable to us as might otherwise be the case.\nIn the event that sufficient additional funds are not obtained through strategic collaboration opportunities, sales of securities, funding facilities, licensing arrangements and/or asset sales on a timely basis, we may be required to reduce expenses through the delay, reduction or curtailment of our projects, or further reduction of costs for facilities and administration. As of the date hereof, we have not obtained a solvency opinion or otherwise conducted a valuation of our properties to determine whether our debts exceed the fair value of our property within the meaning of applicable solvency laws. If we are or become insolvent, holders of our common stock or other securities may lose the entire value of their investment.\nWe cannot provide assurances that changed or unexpected circumstances, including, among other things, delays in manufacturing AFREZZA on a commercial scale, will not result in the depletion of our capital\nresources more rapidly than we currently anticipate, in which case we may be required to raise additional capital. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital, if needed, on favorable terms, or at all. If we need but cannot raise adequate additional capital in the future we will be required to reduce expenses through the delay, reduction or curtailment of our projects, or further reduction of costs for facilities and administration, and there could be substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt pursuant to the 2015 notes, 2019 notes, Tranche B notes, and our loan arrangement with The Mann Group LLC, may incur additional indebtedness under such loan arrangement as well as the Sanofi Loan Facility and may be unable to make required payments of interest and principal as they become due.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $229.5 million principal amount of outstanding debt, consisting of:\n\u2022\n$100.0 million principal amount of 2015 notes bearing interest at 5.75% per annum and maturing on August 15, 2015;\n\u2022\n$60.0 million principal amount of 2019 notes bearing interest at 9.75% per annum, $5.0 million of which is due and payable in July 2016, $15.0 million of which is due and payable in July 2017, $15.0 million of which is due and payable in July 2018 and $25.0 million of which is due and payable in July and December 2019;\n\u2022\n$20.0 million principal amount of Tranche B notes bearing interest at 8.75% per annum, $5.0 million of which is due and payable in each of May 2017, 2018 and 2019, the balance of which is due and payable in December 2019; and\n\u2022\n$49.5 million principal amount of indebtedness under the loan arrangement, dated as of October 2, 2007, between us and The Mann Group LLC (as amended, restated or otherwise modified as of the date hereof, the \u201cLoan Arrangement\u201d) bearing interest at 5.84% and maturing and due on January 5, 2020.\nIn addition, we may borrow up to an aggregate $175.0 million pursuant to the Sanofi Loan Facility to fund our share of net losses under the Sanofi License Agreement, $3.0 million, and an additional $30.1 million under the Loan Arrangement. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make any required repayments of principal under the 2015 notes, 2019 notes or Tranche B notes when required. Further, if we undergo a fundamental change, as that term is defined in the indentures governing the terms of the 2015 notes, or certain Major Transactions as defined in our facility agreement with Deerfield dated July 1, 2013 (as amended, the \u201cFacility Agreement\u201d) in respect of the 2019 notes and the Tranche B notes, the holders of the respective debt securities will have the option to require us to repurchase all or any portion of such debt securities at a repurchase price of 100% of the principal amount of such debt securities to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The 2015 notes bear interest at the rate of 5.75% per year on the outstanding principal amount, payable in cash semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, and the 2019 notes bear interest at the rate of 9.75% per year on the outstanding principal amount, payable in cash quarterly in arrears on the last business day of March, June, September and December of each year. The Tranche B notes bear interest at the rate of 8.75% on the outstanding principal amount, payable in cash quarterly in arrears on the last business day of March, June, September and December of each year. Loans under the Sanofi Loan Facility bear interest at a rate of 8.5% per annum, paid-in-kind on a quarterly basis (2.06% per quarter compounded). Loans under the Loan Arrangement accrue interest at a rate of 5.84% per annum, due and payable quarterly in arrears on the first day of each calendar quarter for the preceding quarter, or at such other time as we and The Mann Group LLC mutually agree. While we have been able to timely make our required interest payments to date, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future. If we fail to pay interest on the 2015 notes, 2019 notes, Tranche B notes, or on the loans under the Sanofi Loan Facility, or if we fail to repay or repurchase the 2015 notes, 2019 notes, Tranche B notes, or the loans under the Sanofi Loan Facility when required, we will be in default under the indenture or other applicable instrument for such debt securities or loans, and may also suffer an event of default under the terms of other borrowing arrangements that we may enter into from time to time. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, up to and including the note holders initiating bankruptcy proceedings or causing us to cease operations altogether.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that we may not be able to meet and place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility.\nOur obligations under the Facility Agreement, including any indebtedness under the 2019 notes and the Tranche B notes, and the Milestone Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property, accounts receivables, equipment, general intangibles, inventory (excluding the insulin inventory) and investment property, and all of the proceeds and products of the foregoing. Our obligations under the Facility Agreement and the Milestone Agreement are also secured by a certain mortgage on our facility in Danbury, Connecticut. Our obligations under the Sanofi Loan Facility are secured by a first priority mortgage on our facility in Valencia, California, a first priority security interest in certain insulin inventory located in the United States and any contractual rights and obligations pursuant to which we purchase or have purchased such insulin, and a second priority security interest in our assets that secure our obligations under the Facility Agreement.\nThe Facility Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by us, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant certain liens, engage in certain mergers and acquisitions, make certain distributions and make certain voluntary prepayments. Events of default under the Facility Agreement include: our failure to timely make payments due under the 2019 notes or the Tranche B notes; inaccuracies in our representations and warranties to Deerfield; our failure to comply with any of our covenants under any of the Facility Agreement, Milestone Agreement or certain other related security agreements and documents entered into in connection with the Facility Agreement, subject to a cure period with respect to most covenants; our insolvency or the occurrence of certain bankruptcy-related events; certain judgments against us; the suspension, cancellation or revocation of governmental authorizations that are reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our business; the acceleration of a specified amount of our indebtedness; our cash and cash equivalents, including amounts available to us under the Loan Arrangement, falling below $25.0 million as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. If one or more events of default under the Facility Agreement occurs and continues beyond any applicable cure period, the holders of the 2019 notes and Tranche B notes may declare all or any portion of the 2019 notes and Tranche B notes to be immediately due and payable. The Milestone Agreement includes customary representations and warranties and covenants by us, including restrictions on transfers of intellectual property related to AFREZZA. The milestones are subject to acceleration in the event we transfer our intellectual property related to AFREZZA in violation of the terms of the Milestone Agreement. Similarly, the Sanofi Loan Facility includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by us, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant certain liens and make certain changes to our organizational documents. Events of default under the Sanofi Loan Facility include: our failure to make timely payments due under the Sanofi Loan Facility; inaccuracies in our representations and warranties to the lender; our failure to comply with any of our covenants under any of the Sanofi Loan Facility or certain other related security agreements and documents entered into in connection with the Sanofi Loan Facility, subject to a cure period with respect to most covenants; our insolvency or the occurrence of certain bankruptcy-related events; termination by Sanofi of the Sanofi License Agreement as a result of our breach of the Sanofi License Agreement; and the failure of any material provision under any of the Sanofi Loan Facility or certain other related security agreements and documents entered into in connection with the Sanofi Loan Facility to remain in full force and effect. If one or more events of default occurs and is continuing, the lender may terminate its obligation to make advances under the Sanofi Loan Facility, and, if certain specified events of default (including our failure to timely make payments due under the Sanofi Loan Facility; our failure to comply with the negative covenants under the Sanofi Loan Facility limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness or grant certain liens; our insolvency or the occurrence of certain bankruptcy-related events; termination by Sanofi of the Sanofi License Agreement as a result of our breach of the non-compete provisions of the Sanofi License Agreement; or the failure of any material provision under any of the Sanofi Loan Facility or certain other related security agreements and documents entered into in connection with the Sanofi Loan Facility to remain in full force and effect) occur and are continuing, the lender may accelerate all of our repayment obligations under the Sanofi Loan Facility and otherwise exercise any of its remedies as a secured creditor.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the covenants under any of the foregoing agreements, and we cannot predict whether the holders of the 2019 notes or Tranche B notes or the lender under\nthe Sanofi Loan Facility would demand repayment of the outstanding balance of the 2019 notes, the Tranche B notes or the loans under the Sanofi Loan Facility as applicable or exercise any other remedies available to such holders if we were unable to comply with these covenants. The covenants and restrictions contained in the foregoing agreements could significantly limit our ability to respond to changes in our business or competitive activities or take advantage of business opportunities that may create value for our stockholders and the holders of our other securities. In addition, our inability to meet or otherwise comply with the covenants under these agreements could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations and could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness, including our indebtedness under the 2015 notes. In the event of certain future defaults under the foregoing agreements for which we are not able to obtain waivers, the holders of the 2015 notes, 2019 notes and Tranche B notes and the lender under the Sanofi Loan Facility may accelerate all of our repayment obligations, and, with respect to the 2019 notes and Tranche B notes and the loans under the Sanofi Loan Facility, take control of our pledged assets, potentially requiring us to renegotiate the terms of our indebtedness on terms less favorable to us, or to immediately cease operations.\nIf we enter into additional debt arrangements, the terms of such additional arrangements could further restrict our operating and financial flexibility. In the event we must cease operations and liquidate our assets, the rights of any holders of our outstanding secured debt would be senior to the rights of the holders of our unsecured debt and our common stock to receive any proceeds from the liquidation.\nIf we do not achieve our projected development goals in the timeframes we announce and expect, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed and the market price of our common stock and other securities could decline.\nFor planning purposes, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory and other product development goals, which we sometimes refer to as milestones. These milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical studies and the submission of regulatory filings. From time to time, we publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones. All of these milestones are based on a variety of assumptions. The actual timing of the achievement of these milestones can vary dramatically from our estimates, in many cases for reasons beyond our control, depending on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe rate of progress, costs and results of our clinical studies and preclinical research and development activities;\n\u2022\nour ability to identify and enroll patients who meet clinical study eligibility criteria;\n\u2022\nour ability to access sufficient, reliable and affordable supplies of components used in the manufacture of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs of expanding and maintaining manufacturing operations, as necessary;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which our clinical studies compete for clinical sites and eligible subjects with clinical studies sponsored by other companies; and\n\u2022\nactions by regulators.\nIn addition, if we do not obtain sufficient additional funds through sales of securities, strategic collaborations or the license or sale of certain of our assets on a timely basis, we may be required to reduce expenses by delaying, reducing or curtailing our development of product candidates. If we fail to commence or complete, or experience delays in or are forced to curtail, our proposed clinical programs or otherwise fail to adhere to our projected development goals in the timeframes we announce and expect (or within the timeframes expected by analysts or investors), our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed and the market price of our common stock and other securities may decline.\nAFREZZA or our product candidates may be rendered obsolete by rapid technological change.\nA number of established pharmaceutical companies have or are developing technologies for the treatment of unmet medical needs.\nThe rapid rate of scientific discoveries and technological changes could result in AFREZZA or one or more of our product candidates becoming obsolete or noncompetitive. Our competitors may develop or introduce new products that render our technology or AFREZZA less competitive, uneconomical or obsolete. Our future success will depend not only on our ability to develop our product candidates but to improve them and keep pace with emerging industry developments. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so.\nWe also expect to face competition from universities and other non-profit research organizations. These institutions carry out a significant amount of research and development in various areas of unmet medical need. These institutions are becoming increasingly aware of the commercial value of their findings and are more active in seeking patent and other proprietary rights as well as licensing revenues.\nContinued testing of AFREZZA or our product candidates may not yield successful results, and even if it does, we may still be unable to commercialize our product candidates.\nForecasts about the effects of the use of drugs, including AFREZZA, over terms longer than the clinical studies or in much larger populations may not be consistent with the earlier clinical results. For example, with the approval of AFREZZA, the FDA has required a five-year, randomized, controlled trial in 8,000 - 10,000 patients with type 2 diabetes, the primary objective of which is to compare the incidence of pulmonary malignancy observed with AFREZZA to that observed in a standard of care control group. If long-term use of a drug results in adverse health effects or reduced efficacy or both, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may terminate our or our marketing partner\u2019s ability to market and sell the drug, may narrow the approved indications for use or otherwise require restrictive product labeling or marketing, or may require further clinical studies, which may be time-consuming and expensive and may not produce favorable results.\nOur research and development programs are designed to test the safety and efficacy of our product candidates through extensive nonclinical and clinical testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the testing process that could delay or impact commercialization of any of our product candidates, including the following:\n\u2022\nsafety and efficacy results obtained in our nonclinical and early clinical testing may be inconclusive or may not be predictive of results that we may obtain in our future clinical studies or following long-term use, and we may as a result be forced to stop developing a product candidate or alter the marketing of an approved product;\n\u2022\nthe analysis of data collected from clinical studies of our product candidates may not reach the statistical significance necessary, or otherwise be sufficient to support FDA or other regulatory approval for the claimed indications;\n\u2022\nafter reviewing clinical data, we or any collaborators may abandon projects that we previously believed were promising; and\n\u2022\nour product candidates may not produce the desired effects or may result in adverse health effects or other characteristics that preclude regulatory approval or limit their commercial use once approved.\nAs a result of any of these events, we, any collaborator, the FDA, or any other regulatory authorities, may suspend or terminate clinical studies or marketing of the drug at any time. Any suspension or termination of our clinical studies or marketing activities may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our common stock and other securities may decline.\nIf our suppliers fail to deliver materials and services needed for the production of AFREZZA in a timely and sufficient manner, if they fail to comply with applicable regulations, or if we fail to identify and qualify alternative suppliers, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed and the market price of our common stock and other securities could decline.\nFor the commercial manufacture of AFREZZA, we need access to sufficient, reliable and affordable supplies of insulin, our AFREZZA inhaler, the related cartridges and other materials. Currently, the only approved source\nof insulin for AFREZZA is manufactured by Amphastar. We must rely on our suppliers, including Amphastar, to comply with relevant regulatory and other legal requirements, including the production of insulin in accordance with the FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMPs\u201d) for drug products, and the production of the AFREZZA inhaler and related cartridges in accordance with Quality System Regulations (\u201cQSRs\u201d). The supply of any of these materials may be limited or any of the manufacturers may not meet relevant regulatory requirements, and if we are unable to obtain any of these materials in sufficient amounts, in a timely manner and at reasonable prices, or if we encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with manufacturers or suppliers, the production of AFREZZA may be delayed. Likewise, if Amphastar ceases to manufacture or is otherwise unable to deliver insulin for AFREZZA, we will need to locate an alternative source of supply and the production of AFREZZA may be delayed. Pursuant to our supply agreement with Sanofi, we are required to identify alternative suppliers for all critical raw materials for the manufacture of AFREZZA within two years after the date of the agreement. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and qualify such suppliers within the time period required under the agreement. If any of our suppliers is unwilling or unable to meet its supply obligations and we are unable to secure an alternative supply source in a timely manner and on favorable terms, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be harmed and the market price of our common stock and other securities may decline.\nWe have little experience manufacturing AFREZZA in commercial quantities, and if we fail as an effective manufacturing organization or fail to engage third-party manufacturers with this capability, we may be unable to support commercialization of this product.\nWe use our Danbury, Connecticut facility to formulate AFREZZA inhalation powder, fill plastic cartridges with the powder, package the cartridges in blister packs, and place the blister packs into foil pouches. We utilize a contract packager to assemble the final kits of foil-pouched blisters containing cartridges along with inhalers and the package insert. The manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, especially in scaling up initial production. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control and assurance and shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. If we engage a third-party manufacturer, we would need to transfer our technology to that third-party manufacturer and gain FDA approval, potentially causing delays in product delivery. In addition, our third-party manufacturer may not perform as agreed or may terminate its agreement with us.\nAny of these factors could cause us to delay or suspend production, could entail higher costs and may result in our being unable to effectively support commercialization of AFREZZA. Furthermore, if we or a third-party manufacturer fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of the product or any raw material on a timely basis, and at commercially reasonable prices and acceptable quality, and we were unable to promptly find one or more replacement manufacturers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, in substantially equivalent volume and quality on a timely basis, we would likely be unable to meet demand for AFREZZA and we would lose potential revenues, and could result in the termination of the Sanofi License Agreement by Sanofi at its election if specified circumstances exist and certain conditions are met.\nIf AFREZZA or any other product that we develop does not become widely accepted by physicians, patients, third-party payors and the healthcare community, we may be unable to generate significant revenue, if any.\nAFREZZA and our other product candidates may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, third-party payors and the healthcare community. Failure to achieve market acceptance would limit our ability to generate revenue and would adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe degree of market acceptance of AFREZZA and our other product candidates will depend on many factors, including the:\n\u2022\napproved labeling claims;\n\u2022\neffectiveness of efforts by us or our marketing partner(s) to educate physicians about the benefits and advantages of AFREZZA or our other products and to provide adequate support for them, and the perceived advantages and disadvantages of competitive products;\n\u2022\nwillingness of the healthcare community and patients to adopt new technologies;\n\u2022\nability to manufacture the product in sufficient quantities with acceptable quality and cost;\n\u2022\nperception of patients and the healthcare community, including third-party payors, regarding the safety, efficacy and benefits compared to competing products or therapies;\n\u2022\nconvenience and ease of administration relative to existing treatment methods;\n\u2022\ncoverage and pricing and reimbursement relative to other treatment therapeutics and methods; and\n\u2022\nmarketing and distribution support.\nBecause of these and other factors, AFREZZA and any other product that we get approved may not gain market acceptance, which would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf third-party payors do not cover AFREZZA or any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval, AFREZZA or such product candidates might not be prescribed, used or purchased, which would adversely affect our revenues.\nOur future revenues and ability to generate positive cash flow from operations may be affected by the continuing efforts of governments and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare through various means. For example, in certain foreign markets the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In the United States, there has been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental controls. We cannot be certain what legislative proposals will be adopted or what actions federal, state or private payors for healthcare goods and services may take in response to any drug pricing reform proposals or legislation. Such reforms may limit our ability to generate revenues from sales of AFREZZA or our other product candidates and achieve profitability. Further, to the extent that such reforms have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and profitability of our marketing partner for AFREZZA, and companies that are prospective collaborators for our product candidates, our ability to commercialize AFREZZA and our product candidates under development may be adversely affected.\nIn the United States and elsewhere, sales of prescription pharmaceuticals still depend in large part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third-party payors, such as governmental and private insurance plans. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. The market for AFREZZA and our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on access to third-party payors\u2019 drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. In addition, because each third-party payor individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming and costly process. We would be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payor separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained. This process could delay the market acceptance of any product and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating results. Even if we succeed in bringing more products to market, we cannot be certain that any such products would be considered cost-effective or that coverage and adequate reimbursement to the consumer would be available. Patients will be unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products.\nIn addition, in many foreign countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control. In some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a\ndrug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. We may face competition for AFREZZA or any of our other product candidates that receives marketing approval from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, there may be importation of foreign products that compete with our own products, which could negatively impact our profitability.\nIf we or our marketing partner are unable to obtain coverage of, and adequate payment levels for, AFREZZA or any of our other product candidates that receive marketing approval from third-party payors, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them and patients may decline to purchase them. This in turn could affect our and our marketing partner\u2019s ability to successfully commercialize AFREZZA and our ability to successfully commercialize any of our other product candidates that receives regulatory approval and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nHealthcare legislation may make it more difficult to receive revenues.\nIn both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals in recent years to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, \u201cPPACA\u201d), became law in the United States. PPACA substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affects the healthcare industry. Among the provisions of PPACA of importance to us are the following:\n\u2022\nan annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;\n\u2022\na 2.3% medical device excise tax on certain transactions, including many U.S. sales of medical devices, which currently includes and we expect will continue to include U.S. sales of certain drug-device combination products;\n\u2022\nan increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively;\n\u2022\nexpansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022\na new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u2022\nextension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u2022\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u2022\nexpansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u2022\nnew requirements to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in PPACA and its implementing regulations, including reporting any \u201cpayments or transfers of value\u201d made or distributed to prescribers,\nteaching hospitals and other healthcare providers and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations during the preceding calendar year;\n\u2022\na new requirement to annually report drug samples that certain manufacturers and authorized distributors provide to physicians; and\n\u2022\na new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since PPACA was enacted. For example, on August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013, and will stay in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the \u201cATRA\u201d), which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.\nWe expect that PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private third-party payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.\nIf we or our marketing partner fail to comply with federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nAs a biopharmaceutical company, even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, including those pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to our business. For example, we could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which constrains our business activities, including our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities by prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (\u201cHITECH\u201d) and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal physician sunshine requirements under PPACA, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members; and\n\u2022\nstate and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts certain payments that may be made to healthcare providers and entities; and state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfer of value to physicians and other healthcare providers and entities.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exceptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. To the extent that AFREZZA or any of our product candidates that receives marketing approval is ultimately sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion of products from reimbursement under U.S. federal or state healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud laws may prove costly.\nIf product liability claims are brought against us, we may incur significant liabilities and suffer damage to our reputation.\nThe testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of AFREZZA and our other product candidates expose us to potential product liability claims. A product liability claim may result in substantial judgments as well as consume significant financial and management resources and result in adverse publicity, decreased demand for a product, injury to our reputation, withdrawal of clinical studies volunteers and loss of revenues. We currently carry worldwide product liability insurance in the amount of $10.0 million. In addition, we carry local clinical trial insurance policies per study in each country in which we conduct clinical studies that require us to carry coverage based on local statutory requirements. However, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise, and because insurance coverage in our industry can be very expensive and difficult to obtain, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain sufficient coverage at an acceptable cost, if at all. If losses from such claims exceed our liability insurance coverage, we may ourselves incur substantial liabilities. If we are required to pay a product liability claim our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed and the market price of our common stock and other securities may decline.\nIf we lose any key employees or scientific advisors, our operations and our ability to execute our business strategy could be materially harmed.\nWe face intense competition for qualified employees among companies in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees. We may be unable to attract and retain these individuals on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, in order to commercialize AFREZZA successfully, we may be required to expand our work force, particularly in\nthe areas of manufacturing. These activities will require the addition of new personnel, including management, and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain any such new personnel on acceptable terms, if at all.\nThe loss of the services of any principal member of our management and scientific staff could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our scientific and business objectives. All of our employees are \u201cat will\u201d and we currently do not have employment agreements with any of the principal members of our management or scientific staff, and we do not have key person life insurance to cover the loss of any of these individuals. Replacing key employees may be difficult and time-consuming because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the skills and experience required to develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products successfully.\nWe have relationships with scientific advisors at academic and other institutions to conduct research or assist us in formulating our research, development or clinical strategy. These scientific advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, and other obligations with, other entities that may limit their availability to us. We have limited control over the activities of these scientific advisors and can generally expect these individuals to devote only limited time to our activities. Failure of any of these persons to devote sufficient time and resources to our programs could harm our business. In addition, these advisors are not prohibited from, and may have arrangements with, other companies to assist those companies in developing technologies that may compete with AFREZZA or our product candidates.\nIf our internal controls over financial reporting are not considered effective, our business, financial condition and market price of our common stock and other securities could be adversely affected.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year, and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in our annual report on Form 10-K for that fiscal year. Section 404 also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, and report on, our internal controls over financial reporting.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud involving a company have been, or will be, detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. We cannot assure you that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in our internal controls in the future. A material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting would require management and our independent registered public accounting firm to evaluate our internal controls as ineffective. If our internal controls over financial reporting are not considered effective, we may experience a loss of public confidence, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and the market price of our common stock and other securities.\nWe may undertake internal restructuring activities in the future that could result in disruptions to our business or otherwise materially harm our results of operations or financial condition.\nFrom time to time we may undertake internal restructuring activities as we continue to evaluate and attempt to optimize our cost and operating structure in light of developments in our business strategy and long-term operating plans. These activities may result in write-offs or other restructuring charges. There can be no\nassurance that any restructuring activities that we undertake will achieve the cost savings, operating efficiencies or other benefits that we may initially expect. Restructuring activities may also result in a loss of continuity, accumulated knowledge and inefficiency during transitional periods and thereafter. In addition, internal restructurings can require a significant amount of time and focus from management and other employees, which may divert attention from commercial operations. If we undertake any internal restructuring activities and fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits therefrom, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur operations might be interrupted by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event.\nWe expect that at least for the foreseeable future, our manufacturing facility in Danbury, Connecticut will be the sole location for the manufacturing of AFREZZA. This facility and the manufacturing equipment we use would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace. In addition, we are headquartered in Valencia, California. This facility contains our principal executive offices and is used to provide support for the development of our Technosphere technology programs. We depend on our facilities and on collaborators, contractors and vendors for the continued operation of our business, some of whom are located in other countries. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events, including interruptions in the supply of natural resources, political and governmental changes, severe weather conditions, wildfires and other fires, explosions, actions of animal rights activists, terrorist attacks, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and wars could disrupt our operations or those of our collaborators, contractors and vendors. We might suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our and our contractors\u2019 insurance policies or for which we or our contractors do not have coverage. For example, we are not insured against a terrorist attack. Any natural disaster or catastrophic event could have a significant negative impact on our operations and financial results. Moreover, any such event could delay our research and development programs and adversely affect, which may include stopping, our readiness for commercial production.\nWe deal with hazardous materials and must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur research and development work involves the controlled storage and use of hazardous materials, including chemical and biological materials. In addition, our manufacturing operations involve the use of a chemical that may form an explosive mixture under certain conditions. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations (i) governing how we use, manufacture, store, handle and dispose of these materials (ii) imposing liability for costs of cleaning up, and damages to natural resources from past spills, waste disposals on and off-site, or other releases of hazardous materials or regulated substances, and (iii) regulating workplace safety. Moreover, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated, and in the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that may result, and any liability could fall outside the coverage or exceed the limits of our insurance. Currently, our general liability policy provides coverage up to $1.0 million per occurrence and $2.0 million in the aggregate and is supplemented by an umbrella policy that provides a further $4.0 million of coverage; however, our insurance policy excludes pollution liability coverage and we do not carry a separate hazardous materials policy. In addition, we could be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future. Finally, current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts or have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhen we purchased the facilities located in Danbury, Connecticut in 2001, a soil and groundwater investigation and remediation was being conducted by a former site operator (the responsible party) under the oversight of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. During the construction of our expanded manufacturing facility, we excavated contaminated soil under the footprint of our building expansion location. The responsible party reimbursed us for our increased excavation and disposal costs of contaminated soil in the amount of $1.6 million. It has conducted at its expense all work and will make all filings necessary to achieve closure for the environmental remediation conducted at the site, and has agreed to indemnify us for any future\ncosts and expenses we may incur that are directly related to the final closure. If we are unable to collect these future costs and expenses, if any, from the responsible party, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\nRISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION\nOur product candidates must undergo costly and time-consuming rigorous nonclinical and clinical testing and we must obtain regulatory approval prior to the sale and marketing of any product in each jurisdiction. The results of this testing or issues that develop in the review and approval by a regulatory agency may subject us to unanticipated delays or prevent us from marketing any products\nOur research and development activities, as well as the manufacturing and marketing of AFREZZA and our product candidates, are subject to regulation, including regulation for safety, efficacy and quality, by the FDA in the United States and comparable authorities in other countries. FDA regulations and the regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities are wide-ranging and govern, among other things:\n\u2022\nproduct design, development, manufacture and testing;\n\u2022\nproduct labeling;\n\u2022\nproduct storage and shipping;\n\u2022\npre-market clearance or approval;\n\u2022\nadvertising and promotion; and\n\u2022\nproduct sales and distribution.\nThe requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies and manufacturing and marketing of AFREZZA and our product candidates outside the United States vary widely from country to country. Foreign approvals may take longer to obtain than FDA approvals and can require, among other things, additional testing and different clinical study designs. Foreign regulatory approval processes include essentially all of the risks associated with the FDA approval processes. Some of those agencies also must approve prices of the products. Approval of a product by the FDA does not ensure approval of the same product by the health authorities of other countries. In addition, changes in regulatory policy in the United States or in foreign countries for product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review of each submitted new application may cause delays or rejections.\nClinical testing can be costly and take many years, and the outcome is uncertain and susceptible to varying interpretations. We cannot be certain if or when regulatory agencies might request additional studies, under what conditions such studies might be requested, or what the size or length of any such studies might be. The clinical studies of our product candidates may not be completed on schedule, regulatory agencies may order us to stop or modify our research, or these agencies may not ultimately approve any of our product candidates for commercial sale. The data collected from our clinical studies may not be sufficient to support regulatory approval of our product candidates. Even if we believe the data collected from our clinical studies are sufficient, regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in the approval process and may disagree with our interpretation of the data. Our failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of any of our product candidates would delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates, which could prevent us from achieving profitability.\nQuestions that have been raised about the safety of marketed drugs generally, including pertaining to the lack of adequate labeling, may result in increased cautiousness by regulatory agencies in reviewing new drugs based on safety, efficacy, or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals. Such regulatory considerations may also result in the imposition of more restrictive drug labeling or marketing requirements as conditions of approval, which may significantly affect the marketability of our drug products.\nIf we do not comply with regulatory requirements at any stage, whether before or after marketing approval is obtained, we may be subject to criminal prosecution, fined or forced to remove a product from the market or experience other adverse consequences, including restrictions or delays in obtaining regulatory marketing approval.\nEven if we comply with regulatory requirements, we may not be able to obtain the labeling claims necessary or desirable for product promotion. We may also be required to undertake post-marketing studies. For example, the FDA is requiring the following post-marketing studies for AFREZZA:\n\u2022\na clinical trial to evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy in pediatric patients;\n\u2022\na clinical trial to evaluate the potential risk of pulmonary malignancy with AFREZZA (as well as cardiovascular risk and the long-term effect of AFREZZA on pulmonary function); and\n\u2022\ntwo pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies, one to characterize dose-response and one to characterize within-subject variability.\nIn addition, if we or other parties identify adverse effects after any of our products are on the market, or if manufacturing problems occur, regulatory approval may be withdrawn and a reformulation of our products, additional clinical studies, changes in labeling of, or indications of use for, our products and/or additional marketing applications may be required. If we encounter any of the foregoing problems, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed and the market price of our common stock and other securities may decline.\nWe are subject to stringent, ongoing government regulation.\nThe manufacture, marketing and sale of AFREZZA are subject to stringent and ongoing government regulation. The FDA may also withdraw product approvals if problems concerning the safety or efficacy of a product appear following approval. We cannot be sure that FDA and United States Congressional initiatives or actions by foreign regulatory bodies pertaining to ensuring the safety of marketed drugs or other developments pertaining to the pharmaceutical industry will not adversely affect our operations.\nWe also are required to register our establishments and list our products with the FDA and certain state agencies. We and any third-party manufacturers or suppliers must continually adhere to federal regulations setting forth requirements, known as cGMP (for drugs) and QSR (for medical devices), and their foreign equivalents, which are enforced by the FDA and other national regulatory bodies through their facilities inspection programs. In complying with cGMP and foreign regulatory requirements, we and any of our potential third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be obligated to expend time, money and effort in production, record-keeping and quality control to ensure that our products meet applicable specifications and other requirements. QSR requirements also impose extensive testing, control and documentation requirements. State regulatory agencies and the regulatory agencies of other countries have similar requirements. In addition, we will be required to comply with regulatory requirements of the FDA, state regulatory agencies and the regulatory agencies of other countries concerning the reporting of adverse events and device malfunctions, corrections and removals (e.g., recalls), promotion and advertising and general prohibitions against the manufacture and distribution of adulterated and misbranded devices. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements could result in civil fines, product seizures, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution of responsible individuals and us. Any such actions would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur suppliers are subject to FDA inspection.\nWe depend on suppliers for insulin and other materials that comprise AFREZZA, including our AFREZZA inhaler and cartridges. Each supplier must comply with relevant regulatory requirements and is subject to inspection by the FDA. There can be no assurance, in the conduct of an inspection of any of our suppliers that the agency would find that the supplier substantially complies with the QSR or cGMP requirements, where applicable. If we or any potential third-party manufacturer or supplier fails to comply with these requirements or comparable requirements in foreign countries, regulatory authorities may subject us to regulatory action, including criminal prosecutions, fines and suspension of the manufacture of our products.\nIf we are required to find a new or additional supplier of insulin, we will be required to evaluate the new supplier\u2019s ability to provide insulin that meets regulatory requirements, including cGMP requirements as well as our specifications and quality requirements, which would require significant time and expense and could delay the manufacturing and commercialization of AFREZZA.\nReports of side effects or safety concerns in related technology fields or in other companies\u2019 clinical studies could delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates or negatively impact public perception of AFREZZA or our other product candidates.\nAt present, there are a number of clinical studies being conducted by other pharmaceutical companies involving insulin delivery systems. If other pharmaceutical companies announce that they observed frequent adverse events in their studies involving insulin therapies, we may be subject to class warnings in the label for AFREZZA. In addition, the public perception of AFREZZA might be adversely affected, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and cause the market price of our common stock and other securities to decline, even if the concern relates to another company\u2019s products or product candidates.\nThere are also a number of clinical studies being conducted by other pharmaceutical companies involving compounds similar to, or competitive with, our other product candidates. Adverse results reported by these other companies in their clinical studies could delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval or negatively impact public perception of our product candidates, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and cause the market price of our common stock and other securities to decline.\nRISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nIf we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, we may not be able to compete effectively, or operate profitably.\nOur commercial success depends, in large part, on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our technology. Our ability to do so will depend on, among other things, complex legal and factual questions, and it should be noted that the standards regarding intellectual property rights in our fields are still evolving. We attempt to protect our proprietary technology through a combination of patents, trade secrets and confidentiality agreements. We own a number of domestic and international patents, have a number of domestic and international patent applications pending and have licenses to additional patents. We cannot assure you that our patents and licenses will successfully preclude others from using our technologies, and we could incur substantial costs in seeking enforcement of our proprietary rights against infringement. Even if issued, the patents may not give us an advantage over competitors with alternative technologies.\nMoreover, the term of a patent is limited and, as a result, the patents protecting our products expire at various dates. For example, some patents providing protection for AFREZZA inhalation powder have terms extending into 2020, 2030 and 2031. In addition, patents providing protection for our inhaler and cartridges have terms extending into 2023, 2031 and 2032, and we have method of treatment claims that extend into 2026 and 2029. As and when these different patents expire, AFREZZA could become subject to increased competition. As a consequence, we may not be able to recover our development costs.\nMoreover, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability and it is uncertain how much protection, if any, will be afforded by our patents. A third party may challenge the validity or enforceability of a patent after its issuance by various proceedings such as oppositions in foreign jurisdictions or re-examinations or other review in the United States. In some instances we may seek re-examination or reissuance of our own patents. If we attempt to enforce our patents, they may be challenged in court where they could be held invalid, unenforceable, or have their breadth narrowed to an extent that would destroy their value.\nOn September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the \u201cLeahy-Smith Act\u201d) was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted, subjected to post-grant challenge, and may also affect patent litigation. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) is continuing to develop\nregulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and while all of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act have become effective, many changes have only recently become effective. Moreover there will be a transitional period of many years during which some applications may be eligible for prosecution under the previous rules. There are many ambiguities in this new law and how the courts will interpret it cannot be predicted with confidence. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. The Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, patent law continues to evolve. Several further changes to patent law are before Congress. The United States Supreme Court has exhibited an increased interest in patent law and several of its recent decisions have tended to narrow the scope of patentable subject matter related to medical products and methods. In March 2014 the USPTO, in response to Supreme Court decisions, issued new examination guidelines which call into question the patentability of biological inventions that had previously been considered patentable. While none of this has an immediately apparent impact on our core technology and patents, the full and ultimate effect of these developments is not yet known. We also rely on unpatented technology, trade secrets, know-how and confidentiality agreements. We require our officers, employees, consultants and advisors to execute proprietary information and invention and assignment agreements upon commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements provide that all inventions developed by the individual on behalf of us must be assigned to us and that the individual will cooperate with us in connection with securing patent protection on the invention if we wish to pursue such protection. We also execute confidentiality agreements with outside collaborators. There can be no assurance, however, that our inventions and assignment agreements and our confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection for our inventions, trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. If any trade secret, know-how or other technology not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf we become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our collaborators or licensors, we would be required to devote substantial time and resources to prosecute or defend such proceedings.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our collaborators or licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover its technology. A court may also decide to award us a royalty from an infringing party instead of issuing an injunction against the infringing activity. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nInterference proceedings brought by the USPTO, may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications or those of our collaborators or licensors. Additionally, the Leahy-Smith Act has greatly expanded the options for post-grant review of patents that can be brought by third parties. Litigation, post-grant review, or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management. We may not be able, alone or with our collaborators and licensors, to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the United States. We may not prevail in any litigation, post-grant review, or interference proceeding in which we are involved. Even if we do prevail, these proceedings can be very expensive and distract our management.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, during the course of this kind of litigation, there could be public\nannouncements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, the market price of our common stock and other securities may decline.\nIf our technologies conflict with the proprietary rights of others, we may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings and we could face substantial monetary damages and be precluded from commercializing our products, which would materially harm our business and financial condition.\nBiotechnology patents are numerous and may, at times, conflict with one another. As a result, it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover the multitude of biotechnology product types. Ultimately, the courts must determine the scope of coverage afforded by a patent and the courts do not always arrive at uniform conclusions.\nA patent owner may claim that we are making, using, selling or offering for sale an invention covered by the owner\u2019s patents and may go to court to stop us from engaging in such activities. Such litigation is not uncommon in our industry.\nPatent lawsuits can be expensive and would consume time and other resources. There is a risk that a court would decide that we are infringing a third party\u2019s patents and would order us to stop the activities covered by the patents, including the commercialization of our products. In addition, there is a risk that we would have to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party\u2019s patents (which damages may be increased, as well as attorneys\u2019 fees ordered paid, if infringement is found to be willful), or that we will be required to obtain a license from the other party in order to continue to commercialize the affected products, or to design our products in a manner that does not infringe a valid patent. We may not prevail in any legal action, and a required license under the patent may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, requiring cessation of activities that were found to infringe a valid patent. We also may not be able to develop a non-infringing product design on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nMoreover, certain components of AFREZZA may be manufactured outside the United States and imported into the United States. As such, third parties could file complaints under 19 U.S.C. Section 337(a)(1)(B) (a \u201c337 action\u201d) with the International Trade Commission (the \u201cITC\u201d). A 337 action can be expensive and would consume time and other resources. There is a risk that the ITC would decide that we are infringing a third party\u2019s patents and either enjoin us from importing the infringing products or parts thereof into the United States or set a bond in an amount that the ITC considers would offset our competitive advantage from the continued importation during the statutory review period. The bond could be up to 100% of the value of the patented products. We may not prevail in any legal action, and a required license under the patent may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, resulting in a permanent injunction preventing any further importation of the infringing products or parts thereof into the United States. We also may not be able to develop a non-infringing product design on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nAlthough we own a number of domestic and foreign patents and patent applications relating to AFREZZA, we have identified certain third-party patents having claims that may trigger an allegation of infringement upon the commercial manufacture and sale of AFREZZA. If a court were to determine that AFREZZA was infringing any of these patent rights, we would have to establish with the court that these patents were invalid or unenforceable in order to avoid legal liability for infringement of these patents. However, proving patent invalidity or unenforceability can be difficult because issued patents are presumed valid. Therefore, in the event that we are unable to prevail in a non-infringement or invalidity action we will have to either acquire the third-party patents outright or seek a royalty-bearing license. Royalty-bearing licenses effectively increase production costs and therefore may materially affect product profitability. Furthermore, should the patent holder refuse to either assign or license us the infringed patents, it may be necessary to cease manufacturing the product entirely and/or design around the patents, if possible. In either event, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed and our profitability could be materially and adversely impacted.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this\ntype of litigation. In addition, during the course of this kind of litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, the market price of our common stock and other securities may decline.\nIn addition, patent litigation may divert the attention of key personnel and we may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. At the same time, some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or result in substantial monetary damages, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cause the market price of our common stock and other securities to decline.\nWe may not obtain trademark registrations for our potential trade names.\nWe have not selected trade names for some of our product candidates; therefore, we have not filed trademark registrations for such potential trade names for our product candidates, nor can we assure that we will be granted registration of any potential trade names for which we do file. No assurance can be given that any of our trademarks will be registered in the United States or elsewhere, or once registered that, prior to our being able to enter a particular market, they will not be cancelled for non-use. Nor can we give assurances, that the use of any of our trademarks will confer a competitive advantage in the marketplace.\nFurthermore, even if we are successful in our trademark registrations, the FDA has its own process for drug nomenclature and its own views concerning appropriate proprietary names. It also has the power, even after granting market approval, to request a company to reconsider the name for a product because of evidence of confusion in the marketplace. We cannot assure you that the FDA or any other regulatory authority will approve of any of our trademarks or will not request reconsideration of one of our trademarks at some time in the future.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness. We may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or we may experience a financial failure.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our future debt agreements. In the absence of sufficient operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or obtain sufficient proceeds from those dispositions to meet our debt service and other obligations then due.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, may depress our stock price and adversely impact the market price of our common stock and other securities.\nIf our existing stockholders or their distributees sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly. The perception in the public market that our existing stockholders might sell shares of common stock could also depress the market price of our common stock and the market price of our other securities. Any such sales of our common stock in the public market may affect the price of our common stock or the market price of our other securities.\nIn the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for: issuance upon the exercise of stock options and, in the future, may be reserved for the vesting of restricted stock unit awards; the purchase of shares of common stock under our employee stock purchase program; and the issuance upon conversion of any shares under the 2015 notes. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance or sale of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such issuances or sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and other securities.\nOur stock price is volatile and may affect the market price of our common stock and other securities.\nThe stock market, particularly in recent years, has experienced significant volatility particularly with respect to pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks, and this trend may continue. The volatility of pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks often does not relate to the operating performance of the companies represented by the stock. Our business and the market price of our common stock may be influenced by a large variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe progress of the commercial launch of AFREZZA and other events or circumstances that we or others estimate will impact the future commercialization of AFREZZA;\n\u2022\nour or Sanofi\u2019s future estimates of AFREZZA sales, prescriptions or other operating metrics;\n\u2022\nthe progress and results of our preclinical and clinical studies of our product candidates and the post-approval studies of AFREZZA required by the FDA;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, political or stock market conditions;\n\u2022\nlegislative developments;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us, our collaborators, or our competitors concerning clinical study results, acquisitions, strategic alliances, technological innovations, newly approved commercial products, product discontinuations, or other developments;\n\u2022\nthe availability of critical materials used in developing and manufacturing AFREZZA or other product candidates;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our collaboration with Sanofi or our relationships with third party manufacturers;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our patents or proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nthe expense and time associated with, and the extent of our ultimate success in, securing regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us concerning our financial condition or operating performance;\n\u2022\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial condition or operating performance;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and fluctuations for emerging growth and pharmaceutical market sectors;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe status of any legal proceedings or regulatory matters against or involving us or any of our executive officers and directors;\n\u2022\nthe existence of, and the issuance of shares of our common stock pursuant to, the share lending agreement and the short sales of our common stock effected in connection with the sale of our 2015 notes;\n\u2022\nthe conversion of any of our 2015 notes into shares of our common stock; and\n\u2022\ndiscussion of AFREZZA, our other product candidates, competitors\u2019 products, or our stock price by the financial and scientific press, the healthcare community and online investor communities such as chat\nrooms. In particular, it may be difficult to verify statements about us and our investigational products that appear on interactive websites that permit users to generate content anonymously or under a pseudonym and statements attributed to company officials may, in fact, have originated elsewhere.\nAny of these risks, as well as other factors, could cause the market value of our common stock and other securities to decline.\nIf other biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies or the securities markets in general encounter problems, the market price of our common stock and other securities could be adversely affected.\nPublic companies in general and companies included on The NASDAQ Global Market in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. There has been particular volatility in the market prices of securities of biotechnology and other life sciences companies, and the market prices of these companies have often fluctuated because of problems or successes in a given market segment or because investor interest has shifted to other segments. These broad market and industry factors may cause the market price of our common stock and other securities to decline, regardless of our operating performance. We have no control over this volatility and can only focus our efforts on our own operations, and even these may be affected due to the state of the capital markets.\nIn the past, following periods of large price declines in the public market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against that company. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which would hurt our business. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\nOur Executive Chairman and principal stockholder can individually control our direction and policies, and his interests may be adverse to the interests of our other stockholders. After his death, his stock will be left to his funding foundations for distribution to various charities, and we cannot assure you of the manner in which those entities will manage their holdings.\nAt December 31, 2014, Alfred E. Mann our Executive Chairman and principal stockholder beneficially owned approximately 37.7% of our outstanding shares of capital stock. By virtue of his holdings, Mr. Mann may be able to heavily influence elections of directors, our management and our affairs and prevent corporate transactions such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets that may be favorable from our standpoint or that of our other stockholders or cause a transaction that we or our other stockholders may view as unfavorable.\nSubject to compliance with United States federal and state securities laws, Mr. Mann is free to sell the shares of our stock he holds at any time. Upon his death, we have been advised by Mr. Mann that his shares of our capital stock will be left to the Alfred E. Mann Medical Research Organization (\u201cAEMMRO\u201d), and AEM Foundation for Biomedical Engineering (\u201cAEMFBE\u201d), not-for-profit medical research foundations that serve as funding organizations for Mr. Mann\u2019s various charities, including the Alfred Mann Foundation (\u201cAMF\u201d), and the Alfred Mann Institutes at the University of Southern California, the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, and Purdue University, and that may serve as funding organizations for any other charities that he may establish. The AEMMRO is a membership foundation consisting of nine members, including Mr. Mann, his wife, three of his children and Dr. Joseph Schulman, the chief scientist of the AEMFBE. The AEMFBE is a membership foundation consisting of five members, including Mr. Mann, his wife, and the same three of his children. Although we understand that the members of AEMMRO and AEMFBE have been advised of Mr. Mann\u2019s objectives for these foundations, once Mr. Mann\u2019s shares of our capital stock become the property of the foundations, we cannot assure you as to how those shares will be distributed or how they will be voted.\nThe future sale of our common stock, the conversion of our 2015 notes into common stock or the exercise of our warrants for common stock could negatively affect the market price of our common stock and other securities.\nAs of February 23, 2015, we had 408,837,603 shares of common stock outstanding. Substantially all of these shares are available for public sale, subject in some cases to volume and other limitations or delivery of a prospectus. If our common stockholders sell substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, or the market perceives that such sales may occur, the market price of our common stock and other securities may decline. Likewise the issuance of additional shares of our common stock upon the conversion of some or all of our 2015 notes, or upon the exercise of some or all of the warrants we issued in February 2012, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and other securities. In addition, the existence of these notes and warrants may encourage short selling of our common stock by market participants, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and other securities.\nIn addition, we will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future to fund our operations. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or additional convertible debt, the market price of our common stock and other securities may decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nWe are incorporated in Delaware. Certain anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law and in our certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as currently in effect, may make a change of control of our company more difficult, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders or the holders of our other securities. Our anti-takeover provisions include provisions such as a prohibition on stockholder actions by written consent, the authority of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, and supermajority voting requirements for specified actions. In addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us in certain circumstances. These provisions may delay or prevent an acquisition of us, even if the acquisition may be considered beneficial by some of our stockholders. In addition, they may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nBecause we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, you must rely on stock appreciation for any return on any investment in our common stock.\nWe have paid no cash dividends on any of our capital stock to date, and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and payment of cash dividends, if any, will also depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors and will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Pursuant to the Facility Agreement, we are subject to contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate or maintain its current price. You could lose the entire value of any investment in our common stock.\nWe have a limited number of unreserved shares available for future issuance, which may impair our ability to conduct future financing and other transactions.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation currently authorizes us to issue up to 550,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2014, we had a total of 76,326,082 shares of common stock that were authorized but unissued, and we have currently reserved a significant number of these shares for future issuance pursuant to outstanding equity awards, our equity plans and our 2015 notes. As a result, our ability to issue shares of common stock other than pursuant to existing\narrangements will be limited until such time, if ever, that we are able to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to further increase our authorized shares of common stock or shares currently reserved for issuance otherwise become available (for example, due to the termination of the underlying agreement to issue the shares).\nIf we are unable to enter into new arrangements to issue shares of our common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into shares of our common stock, our ability to complete equity-based financings or other transactions that involve the potential issuance of our common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into our common stock, will be limited. In lieu of issuing common stock or securities convertible into our common stock in any future equity financing transactions, we may need to issue some or all of our authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, which would likely have superior rights, preferences and privileges to those of our common stock, or we may need to issue debt that is not convertible into shares of our common stock, which may require us to grant security interests in our assets and property and/or impose covenants upon us that restrict our business. If we are unable to issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into our common stock, our ability to enter into strategic transactions such as acquisitions of companies or technologies, may also be limited. If we propose to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase our authorized shares of common stock, such a proposal would require the approval by the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock, and we cannot assure you that such a proposal would be adopted. If we are unable to complete financing, strategic or other transactions due to our inability to issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into our common stock, our financial condition and business prospects may be materially harmed.", "PERMNO": 90285, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "MNKD"}
