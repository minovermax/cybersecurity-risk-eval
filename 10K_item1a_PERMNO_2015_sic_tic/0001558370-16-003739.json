{"cik": "1365038", "company": "DEMAND MEDIA INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nIf Internet search engines continue to modify their methodologies, traffic to our online properties could decline significantly. If we are unable to successfully drive traffic to our online properties, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIn order for our businesses to grow, we must attract new visitors to our online properties and retain our existing visitors. We depend on various Internet search engines, such as Google, Bing and Yahoo!, to direct a significant amount of traffic to our online properties, including online properties that we host for our content channel customers. Our Content & Media properties are particularly dependent on search referral traffic. For the year ended December 31, 2015, based on our internal data, a majority of the traffic directed to eHow and Livestrong.com came directly from Internet search engines and more than half of the traffic from search engines came from Google. Changes in the methodologies or algorithms used by search engines to display results could cause our online properties to receive less favorable placements or be removed from the search results. Internet search engines could decide that content on our online properties, or the size and placement of ad units displayed on webpages hosting our content, is unacceptable or violates their policies. Internet search engines could also view changes made to our online properties unfavorably, leading to lower search result rankings and a decrease in search referral traffic.\nIn addition, search engine providers typically display, together with organic search results, content and links that may divert traffic from the pages referenced in the organic search results, including paid search results and content and links that the search engine provider selects and displays in response to the key words used in specific search queries. Accordingly, even if we rank highly in organic search results, traffic to our properties may be reduced as a result of paid search results and other content included on the search results page generated by a search query.\nGoogle, Bing and Yahoo! regularly deploy changes to their search engine algorithms. Since 2011, we have experienced fluctuations in the total number of Google search referrals to our online properties. During 2013, we experienced several negative changes in Google referrals to our Content & Media properties that, in the aggregate, were larger in magnitude than those we had previously experienced. Beginning in 2014, Bing and Yahoo! began to implement similar changes to their search engine algorithms. The changes to search engine algorithms by Google, Bing and Yahoo! have resulted in, and may continue to result in, substantial declines in traffic directed to our Content & Media properties, particularly eHow, which has contributed to significant revenue declines from our Content & Media properties. Any\nfuture or ongoing changes made by search engines that negatively impact the volume of search referral traffic to any of our online properties could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success in attracting traffic to our Content & Media properties and converting these visitors into repeat users also depends, in part, upon our ability to identify, create and distribute high-quality content through engaging products and our ability to meet rapidly changing consumer demand. We may not be able to identify and create the desired content and produce an engaging user experience in a cost-effective or timely manner, if at all. We also utilize search engine optimization efforts to help generate search referral traffic to our online properties. If we are unable to successfully modify our search engine optimization practices in response to changes in search engine algorithms and search query trends, or if we are unable to generate increased traffic from other sources such as social media and direct navigation, we could continue to experience substantial declines in traffic to our Content & Media properties and to other properties that publish our content, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe generate the majority of our Content & Media revenue from advertising. A reduction in advertising revenue, including as a result of lower ad unit rates, increased availability of ad blocking software, lower online advertising spend, a loss of advertisers or lower advertising yields, could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently generate the majority of our revenue from advertisements displayed on our online properties. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, after giving effect to the Separation, we generated 53%, 70% and 83%, respectively, of our total revenue from advertising, and we expect to continue to derive a significant amount of our revenue from advertising. We have experienced declines in ad unit rates for both desktop and mobile since 2014, resulting in lower advertising revenue, and any further reductions in ad unit rates would negatively impact our financial results. In addition, software developers have been increasing the availability of ad blocking software, particularly on mobile devices. Increased adoption of ad blocking software by users could reduce our advertising revenue and negatively impact our financial results.\nWe also believe that advertising spend on the Internet, as in traditional media, fluctuates significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include variations in expenditures by advertisers due to budgetary constraints; the cyclical and discretionary nature of advertising spending, including the perceived impact of campaign strategies; general economic conditions, as well as economic conditions specific to the Internet and media industry; and the occurrence of extraordinary events, such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks. Brands and advertisers are also increasingly focusing a portion of their online advertising budgets on social media outlets such as Facebook, Snapchat and Pinterest, as well as on native and sponsored advertising campaigns. If this trend continues and we are unable to offer competitive or similarly valued advertising opportunities on our online properties, our revenue from advertising could be adversely impacted. An inability to maintain or increase our advertising revenue would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, our advertising strategy is currently focused on programmatic offerings that utilize various advertising network exchanges, including exchanges operated by Google and Rubicon Project, to manage our ad stack. Operating on a programmatic basis requires us to actively manage the sale of our owned and operated inventory on these exchanges. Although we had shifted our advertising strategy away from direct sales in early 2014, we have recently decided to implement direct sales channels again to improve our branded advertising sales, particularly with respect to native and sponsored ad campaigns. An inability to successfully manage our ad stack, including the programmatic process and our direct sales team, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, one component of our platform that we use to generate advertiser interest is our system of monetization tools, which is designed to match content with advertisements in a manner that optimizes revenue yield and end-user experience. Advertising providers and advertisers will stop placing advertisements on our online properties if their investments do not generate sales leads, branding opportunities and ultimately customers, or if we do not deliver their advertisements in an appropriate and effective manner. The failure of our yield-optimized monetization technology to effectively match advertisements with our content in a manner that results in increased revenue for advertisers would\nhave an adverse impact on our ability to maintain or increase our revenue from advertising. If any of our advertisers or advertising providers, and in particular Google, decides not to continue advertising on, or providing advertisements to, our online properties, or modifies its advertising policies in a manner that could negatively impact yield, we could experience a rapid decline in our revenue over a relatively short period of time.\nWe are dependent upon certain arrangements with Google for a significant portion of our revenue. A termination of, or a loss of revenue generated from, our agreements with Google would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have an extensive relationship with Google and a significant portion of our revenue is derived from advertising provided by Google. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, after giving effect to the Separation, we derived approximately 36%, 50% and 56%, respectively, of our total revenue from our arrangements with Google. Google provides cost-per-click advertisements and cost-per-impression advertisements to our online properties and we receive a portion of the revenue generated by such advertisements. We also utilize Google\u2019s DoubleClick Ad Exchange, an auction marketplace that allows us to sell display advertising space on our online properties. In addition, we use Google\u2019s DoubleClick ad serving technology to deliver advertisements to our online properties. Our services agreement with Google, which governs our various advertising relationships with them, currently expires in October 2016. Google has the right to terminate its agreements with us prior to their expiration upon the occurrence of certain events, including if Google reasonably believes that our use of its services violates the rights of third parties, and other breaches of contractual provisions, a number of which are broadly defined. If our agreements with Google are terminated, or we are unable to enter into new agreements with Google on terms and conditions favorable to us prior to the expiration of the current agreements, we may not be able to enter into agreements with alternative third-party advertisement providers or for alternative ad serving platforms on acceptable terms or on a timely basis or both.\nFurthermore, our advertising agreement with Google may not continue to generate the same level of revenue that we have received from such arrangements during past periods for a variety of reasons, including a reduction in the amounts Google is able to charge advertisers and the possibility that our online properties do not generate sufficient traffic to realize our maximum revenue share percentage with Google. Our ability to generate online advertising revenue from Google also depends, in part, on Google\u2019s assessment of the quality and performance characteristics of Internet traffic resulting from online advertisements placed on our online properties. In addition, Google may at any time change the nature of, or suspend, the services that it provides to online advertisers and the catalog of advertisers from which online advertisements are sourced, or modify its policies with respect to how advertisements may be displayed on a webpage. These types of changes or suspensions would adversely impact our ability to generate revenue from our advertising agreement with Google. Any termination of or change in the services that Google provides to us, or a loss of revenue generated by our advertising agreement with Google, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMobile devices are increasingly being used to access the Internet and our online media offerings may not be as effective when accessed through these devices. Additionally, mobile advertising yields are lower on average than desktop yields, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nThe number of people who access the Internet through mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, rather than through desktop or laptop computers, has increased substantially in recent years. If we cannot effectively distribute our media content, products and services on these devices, we could experience a decline in visits and traffic and a corresponding decline in revenue. It is also more difficult to display advertisements on mobile devices without disrupting the consumer experience. We have made, and may make further, changes to the layouts and formats of our mobile sites in order to improve the user experience or comply with the requirements of our advertising partners, which could negatively impact our monetization efforts on mobile devices. In addition, mobile advertising yields on average are currently lower than those for desktop, in part due to the limitations involved in using cookies on mobile devices to track and optimize mobile advertising and the reduced screen space available to render ads to consumers. The significant increase in mobile consumption of our media content has contributed to a reduction in our Content & Media revenue per one thousand visits, or RPVs. As a result of these factors, the increasing use of mobile devices to access our content could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain changes to the business model for our Content & Media service offering and related expenditures could negatively impact our operating margins in the near-term and may not lead to increased revenue in the long-term.\nWe have recently incurred significant expenses to improve the user experience and engagement on certain of our Content & Media properties by redesigning our websites; removing duplicative or low-quality content; reducing the ad unit density; changing the format of advertising units; improving the mobile experience and adding user engagement tools. Such expenses do not directly generate related revenue and certain changes will likely negatively impact our revenue and operating margins in the near-term. In particular, between 2013 and 2015, we removed a significant amount of content from eHow and Livestrong.com and reduced the number of ad units on each page, which collectively resulted in a large decrease in revenue and will continue to negatively impact revenue and operating margins due to the reduction in content and ad units generating advertising revenue on these sites. We may also incur additional expenses in order to further improve the product and user experience associated with our online properties. These recent changes and any additional changes may not result in increased visits to, or increased revenue generated by, our Content & Media properties in the near-term or long-term. We also plan to continue investing in building our studioD business, which develops and executes content marketing strategies and creates custom content for third-party brands, advertisers and publishers. If these customers do not perceive our content marketing and custom content services to be driving performance for their business, we may not be able to expand our relationship with our current customers or identify and attract new customers, and we may not generate sufficient revenue from this service offering to justify our planned investment in this business.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers to our marketplaces and successfully grow our marketplaces business, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe operate two leading art and design marketplaces and we recently launched a marketplace that carries boutique-style products for pets, as well as animal-themed clothing and accessories. We have limited experience in marketing, managing and growing these revenue streams.\nThe success of our marketplaces is dependent upon a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\ndemand for these types of products and market acceptance of our products;\n\u00b7\nour ability to attract new customers;\n\u00b7\nincreased brand awareness and the reputation of our marketplaces;\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain the artist communities on Society6 and Saatchi Art so that artists continue to contribute and maintain their original artwork and designs on these marketplaces;\n\u00b7\nour ability to cost-effectively introduce and market new products on Society6 on a timely basis to address changing consumption trends and consumer preferences;\n\u00b7\nthe success and competitiveness of new entrants into this highly competitive industry;\n\u00b7\ncompetitive pricing pressures, including potential discounts offered to attract customers and reduced or free shipping;\n\u00b7\nmaintaining significant strategic relationships with our print-on-demand suppliers and ensuring the quality of their products and the timeliness of our production cycle for our art and design marketplaces;\n\u00b7\ndisruptions in the supply-chain, production and fulfillment operations associated with the print-on-demand products sold through our art and design marketplaces;\n\u00b7\nour ability to source local vendors as we look to expand internationally;\n\u00b7\nshipping disruptions or delays with the products sold through our marketplaces;\n\u00b7\nthe return rate for products sold through our marketplaces;\n\u00b7\nthe overall growth rate of e-commerce and marketplaces;\n\u00b7\noverall changes in consumer spending on discretionary purchases; and\n\u00b7\nlegal claims, including copyright and trademark infringement claims, right of publicity claims and product liability claims, which may expose us to greater litigation costs in the future as compared to historical levels.\nOne of the key factors to grow our marketplaces business is expanding our customer base. Our ability to attract new customers, some of whom may already purchase similar products from our competitors, depends in part on our ability to successfully drive traffic to our marketplaces using social media sites, e-mail marketing campaigns, paid referrals and search. We may incur significant expenses related to customer acquisition and the net sales from new customers may not ultimately exceed the cost of acquiring these customers. Additionally, we believe that many of the new customers for our marketplaces originate from word-of-mouth and other non-paid referrals from existing customers. If we fail to deliver a differentiated shopping experience or if customers do not perceive the products sold through our marketplaces to be of high value and quality, we may have difficulty retaining our existing customers and attracting new customers through referrals.\nIf we are unable to successfully grow our marketplaces, including as a result of lower customer growth or retention than expected, or if the revenue generated from initiatives related to our marketplaces is less than the costs of such initiatives, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf the mobile solutions available to buyers and sellers using our marketplaces are not effective, the growth prospects of our marketplaces could decline and our business could be adversely affected.\nConsumers are increasingly conducting online shopping on mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, rather than on desktop computers. Although we have recently introduced mobile applications for Society6 and Saatchi Art and we continue to focus on improving the mobile experience for buyers and sellers using our marketplaces, the smaller screen size and reduced functionality associated with some mobile device interfaces may make the use of our marketplace platforms more difficult or less appealing to our members, and visits to our marketplaces on mobile devices have not converted into purchases as often as visits made through desktop computers. Society6 and Saatchi Art sellers are also increasingly using mobile devices to operate and monitor their businesses on our platforms and if we are not able to deliver a rewarding experience to sellers using mobile devices, our marketplace businesses may suffer. Additionally, our recently launched mobile apps may not result in sufficient increased revenue to justify the expenses of developing and maintaining them, and we may encounter problems with operating the mobile apps in the future. If our members encounter difficulty accessing or using our marketplace platforms on their mobile devices, or if our members choose not to use our marketplace platforms on their mobile devices, our growth prospects and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe face significant competition, which we expect will continue to intensify, and we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position or market share.\nWe operate in highly competitive and still developing markets. The industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, various business models and frequent disruption of incumbents by innovative entrants. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and a failure to increase, or the loss of, market share, would likely seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nContent & Media\nWe face intense competition for our Content & Media service offering from a wide range of competitors. We compete for advertisers and customers on the basis of a number of factors including return on marketing expenditures, price of our offerings and the ability to deliver large amounts, or precise types, of segmented customer traffic. Our current principal competitors include:\n\u00b7\nOnline Media Properties. We compete with numerous Internet media companies, some of which have much larger audiences and financial resources than we have, for online marketing budgets. We also compete with companies and individuals that provide specialized consumer information online, including through enthusiast websites, message boards and blogs. These competitors compete with us across several areas of consumer interest including do-it-yourself, health and healthy living, home and garden, fashion and beauty, crafts, automotive and humor.\n\u00b7\nSocial Media Outlets. We compete with social media outlets such as Facebook, Snapchat and Pinterest, where brands and advertisers are focusing a significant portion of their online advertising spend in order to connect with their customers.\n\u00b7\nDistributed Content Creation Platforms. We compete with other companies, such as Contently and Skyword, that provide content marketing services and/or employ a content creation model with aspects similar to our platform, including the creation of content for third parties.\nWe may be subject to increased future competition to our Content & Media service offering if any of our competitors devote increased resources to more directly address the online market for the professional creation and distribution of content. Many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources, greater technical capabilities, access to larger customer bases and, in some cases, the ability to combine their online marketing products with traditional offline media such as newspapers or magazines. These companies may use these advantages to offer products and services similar to ours at a lower price, develop different products to compete with our current offerings and respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. For example, if Google chose to compete more directly with us, we may face the prospect of the loss of business or other adverse financial consequences due to Google\u2019s significantly greater customer base, financial resources, distribution channels and patent portfolio. Given the intense competition that our Content & Media service offering faces, we may be unable to maintain or improve our competitive position or market share.\nMarketplaces\nOur marketplaces compete with a wide variety of online and brick-and-mortar companies selling comparable products. Society6 competes with companies, such as RedBubble, Zazzle and Minted, that utilize a print-on-demand model whereby specialty products are produced and shipped to customers with selected user or artist generated designs printed on them, as well as small online providers of niche customization services and product offerings. Saatchi Art competes with traditional offline art galleries, art consultants and other online properties selling original artwork, such as Artfinder, Artspace, Ugallery and Amazon Art. We expect competition to continue to intensify as online and offline businesses increasingly compete with each other, and because the barriers to entry into online channels can be low.\nOur marketplaces must successfully attract, retain and engage both buyers and sellers to use our platforms. We believe that the principal competitive factors for our marketplaces include the quality, price and uniqueness of the products or artworks being offered; the selection of goods and artists featured; the ability to source numerous products efficiently and cost-effectively with respect to our print-on-demand products; customer service; the convenience and ease of the shopping experience we provide; and our reputation and brand strength.\nMany of our marketplaces\u2019 current competitors have, and potential competitors may have, longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater technical capabilities, greater brand recognition, differentiated products and services, and substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. These resources may help\nsome of our competitors react more quickly as the industry evolves, focus more on product innovation, and devote substantially more resources to website and system development than we do. Some of our competitors may offer or continue to offer faster and/or free shipping, more favorable return policies or other transaction-related services which improve their user experience, but which could be impractical or inefficient for us to match. Some of our competitors may be able to use the advantages of brick-and-mortar stores or other sorts of physical presence to build their customer bases and drive sales. Our competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies, which may allow them to build larger customer bases or generate net sales from their customer bases more effectively than we do. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against the current and potential competitors to our artist marketplaces.\nWe rely on freelance artists to generate the artwork and designs sold through our art and design marketplaces. We may not be able to attract or retain enough artists to generate artwork and designs on a scale or of a quality sufficient to grow our business.\nOur art and design marketplaces rely on artists to join our communities and contribute original artwork and designs that they seek to sell or monetize through the sale of art prints and other print-on-demand products. We rely on freelance artists to upload their unique art designs to Society6 or sell their original artwork on Saatchi Art and we may not be able to attract or retain enough artists to generate artwork and designs on a scale or of a quality sufficient to grow our business. Furthermore, our competitors may attempt to attract members of our artist communities by offering compensation and revenue-sharing arrangements that we are unable to match. If we are unable to continue attracting artists to our marketplaces, our revenues from sales of artwork and print-on-demand products will decrease, which would have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in expanding our current product or service offerings, or expanding into new lines of business, which could limit our future growth.\nImportant potential areas of growth for us are the development of new product and service offerings and the acquisition or internal development of new lines of business, and we are currently developing certain niche media properties and mobile applications. New product and service offerings and new lines of business may be subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies frequently encountered by new businesses in competitive environments, many of which are beyond our control, including lack of market acceptance. If we develop or acquire new lines of business or new product or service offerings, we may not be able to effectively integrate and manage these new businesses and we may not recover the funds and resources we expend on developing or acquiring them. If we are unable to successfully expand the products and services we offer, or expand into new lines of business, our future growth would be limited which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPoor perception of our brands or business could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Content & Media business is dependent on attracting a large number of visitors to our online properties and providing leads and clicks to our advertisers, which depends in part on our reputation within the industry and with our users. Perception that the quality of our content may not be the same or better than that of other published Internet content, even if baseless, can damage our reputation. In addition, Livestrong.com is a licensed trademark from the Livestrong Foundation and there has been negative publicity surrounding Mr. Armstrong. Any damage to our reputation could harm our ability to attract and retain advertisers, visitors, customers and artists, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend upon the quality of traffic to our online properties to provide value to online advertisers and excessive low-quality traffic could have a material adverse effect on the value of such online properties to our third-party advertisement distribution providers and online advertisers and thereby adversely affect our revenue.\nWe depend upon the quality of traffic to our online properties to provide value to online advertisers. Low-quality traffic can include clicks associated with non-human processes, including robots, spiders or other software; the\nmechanical automation of clicking; and other types of invalid clicks or click fraud. There is a risk that a certain amount of low-quality traffic, or traffic that is deemed to be invalid by advertisers, will be delivered to advertisers on our online properties. As a result, we may be required to credit future amounts owed to us by our advertising partners or repay them for amounts previously received if such future amounts are insufficient. Furthermore, low-quality or invalid traffic may be detrimental to our relationships with third-party advertisement distribution providers and online advertisers and could adversely affect our revenue.\nRisks Relating to our Company\nWe have a history of operating losses and may not be able to operate profitably or generate positive cash flow.\nWe were founded in 2006 and, except for the year ended December 31, 2012, when we generated net income, we have had a net loss in every year from inception, including generating a net loss of $43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015 we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $395.6 million and we may incur net operating losses in the future. Moreover, our cash flows from operating activities do not currently cover all of our operating expenses, and we may not generate sufficient cash to cover operating expenses for the foreseeable future. Our ability to generate net income in the future will depend in large part on our ability to generate and sustain substantially increased revenue levels, while continuing to control our expenses. We may incur significant operating losses in the future for a number of reasons, including those discussed in other risk factors and factors that we cannot foresee, and we may be unable to generate net income or sufficient positive cash flows.\nWe may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all, or without substantial dilution to our stockholders, which may impact our ability to execute on our current or future business strategies.\nWe anticipate that our current cash, cash equivalents and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next 12 months. It is possible, however, that we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have the capital resources to meet our future capital needs, including to invest in areas for growth, and we do not currently have a line of credit in place if we need to borrow funds. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have sufficient capital resources available, we may need to enter into a new financing arrangement or dispose of certain assets to execute on our current or future business strategies, including developing new or investing in existing service offerings, maintaining our operating infrastructure, acquiring complementary businesses, hiring additional personnel or otherwise responding to competitive pressures. We cannot assure you that a new financing arrangement will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Furthermore, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt or equity securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, if and when needed, our ability to fund our operations, meet obligations in the normal course of business, take advantage of strategic opportunities, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited.\nIn connection with the Separation, our operational and financial profile changed and we entered into certain arrangements with Rightside under which we may have indemnification obligations.\nOn August 1, 2014, we completed the Separation of Rightside from Demand Media. We may be unable to achieve some or all of the strategic and financial benefits that we expected would result from the Separation of Demand Media and Rightside, or such benefits may be delayed, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Following the Separation, we are also a smaller company focused on our Content & Media and Marketplaces businesses. This narrower business focus may leave us more vulnerable to changing market conditions and the diminished diversification of revenue, costs, and cash flows could cause our results of operation, cash flows, working capital and financing requirements to be subject to increased volatility. In addition, we entered into various agreements with Rightside in connection with the Separation that governed our relationship with Rightside subsequent to the Separation and contained certain indemnification obligations. If we are required to indemnify Rightside for certain liabilities and related losses arising in connection with any of these agreements or if Rightside is required to indemnify us for certain liabilities and related losses arising in connection with any of these agreements and\ndoes not fulfill its obligations to us, we may be subject to substantial liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.\nIf there is a determination that the Separation is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then we and our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.\nWe received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), together with an opinion of Latham & Watkins LLP, tax counsel to us (the \u201cTax Opinion\u201d), substantially to the effect that, among other things, the Separation qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The private letter ruling and Tax Opinion relied on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from us and Rightside regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. The private letter ruling did not address all the requirements for determining whether the Separation would qualify for tax-free treatment, and the Tax Opinion, which addressed all such requirements but relied on the private letter ruling as to matters covered by the ruling, is not binding on the IRS or the courts. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and the Tax Opinion, the IRS could determine on audit that the Separation should be treated as taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the Tax Opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or Rightside after the Separation.\nIf the Separation ultimately is determined to be taxable, we would be subject to tax as if we had sold the Rightside common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and our stockholders would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of Rightside\u2019s common stock that was distributed to them. Under the tax matters agreement we entered into with Rightside (the \u201cTax Matters Agreement\u201d), we may be required to indemnify Rightside against all or a portion of the taxes incurred by Rightside in the event the Separation were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment under the Code. If we are required to pay any tax liabilities in connection with the Separation pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement or pursuant to applicable tax law, the amounts may be significant.\nWe have agreed to various restrictions to preserve the non-recognition treatment of the Separation, which may reduce our strategic and operating flexibility.\nPursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, we may not take any action that would jeopardize the favorable tax treatment of the Separation. The restrictions under the Tax Matters Agreement may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or engage in other transactions that might increase the value of our business for the two-year period following the Separation. For example, we might determine to continue to operate certain of our business operations for the foreseeable future even if a sale or discontinuance of such business might have otherwise been advantageous. Moreover, in light of the requirements of Section 355(e) of the Code, we might determine to forgo certain transactions, including share repurchases, stock issuances, certain asset dispositions or other strategic transactions for some period of time following the Separation. In addition, our indemnity obligation under the Tax Matters Agreement might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control transaction for some period of time following the Separation.\nThe intangible assets and goodwill on our balance sheet may be subject to impairment. If our intangible assets or goodwill become impaired we may be required to record a significant non-cash charge to earnings which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe carry a substantial amount of intangible assets on our balance sheet, primarily from the creation of our long-lived media content and from certain past acquisitions. We also carry goodwill on our balance sheet from certain acquisitions we have made. We assess potential impairments to our intangible assets and goodwill when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such intangible assets or goodwill may not be recoverable. In the third quarter of 2014, we recorded a $232.3 million pretax impairment charge after we determined that the implied fair value of goodwill in our content and media reporting unit was substantially lower than its carrying value. We most recently performed our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2015, and based on the results, there were no goodwill impairment charges for the year ended December\n31, 2015. Future significant and sustained declines in our stock price and market capitalization relative to our book value or our inability to generate sufficient revenue or cash flows from our long-lived media content or the businesses that we have acquired may result in us having to take additional impairment charges against certain of our intangible assets or goodwill. If we are required to record additional impairment charges in future periods, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly in the period such charge is taken.\nOur operating results may fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis due to a number of factors, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur revenue and operating results could fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Therefore, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors discussed in this section, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\n\u00b7\nlower than anticipated levels of traffic to our owned and operated online properties and to our customers\u2019 online properties;\n\u00b7\nseasonality of the revenue associated with our marketplaces, including increased sales activity during the holiday season;\n\u00b7\nspikes in sales of our print-on-demand products due to major social or political events resulting in a short-term demand for products with related content;\n\u00b7\ncompetitive pricing pressures, including shipping costs and potential discounts offered, associated with the products sold through our marketplaces;\n\u00b7\ndisruptions in the supply-chain, production and fulfillment operations associated with the products sold through our marketplaces;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the maintenance and expansion of our services, operations and infrastructure, especially one-time costs related to the development or acquisition of new products and services;\n\u00b7\nthe level of promotional activity required to drive potential customers to our marketplaces;\n\u00b7\nincreased costs associated with the acquisition or production of new content;\n\u00b7\nchanges in Internet advertising purchasing patterns by advertisers and changes in how we sell advertisements;\n\u00b7\nrealignment costs associated with shifting priorities for our businesses;\n\u00b7\ntiming of and revenue recognition for certain transactions;\n\u00b7\nchanges in generally accepted accounting principles;\n\u00b7\nour focus on long-term goals over short-term results; and\n\u00b7\nweakness or uncertainty in general economic or industry conditions.\nIt is possible that our operating results may fluctuate and our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in one or more future quarters due to any of the factors listed above, a combination\nof those factors or other reasons, which could have a material adverse impact on the price of shares of our common stock.\nWe have made and may make additional acquisitions that involve significant execution, integration and operational risks and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions.\nWe evaluate acquisition and expansion opportunities on an ongoing basis and may pursue select acquisitions. We may continue to make acquisitions of complementary websites, businesses, solutions, technologies or talent in the future to increase the scope of our business. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly. Potential acquisitions require significant attention from our management and could result in a diversion of resources from our existing business, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, the expected benefits of acquisitions may not materialize as planned, including achieving certain financial and revenue objectives. Certain acquired businesses or the transactions entered into as part of business combinations may also carry contingent liabilities that could materially impact our future results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. If we are unable to identify suitable future acquisition opportunities, reach agreement with such parties or obtain the financing necessary to make such acquisitions, we could lose market share to competitors who are able to make such acquisitions. This loss of market share could negatively impact our business, revenue and future growth.\nEven if we successfully complete an acquisition, we may not be able to successfully assimilate and integrate the acquired websites, business, assets, technologies, solutions, personnel or operations, particularly if key personnel of an acquired company decide not to work for us, and we therefore may not achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisition. Acquisitions also could harm our reputation or brands generally, as well as our relationships with existing customers. In addition, financing an acquisition may require us to (i) use substantial portions of our available cash on hand, (ii) incur additional indebtedness, which would increase our costs and impose operational limitations, and/or (iii) issue equity securities, which would dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock. We may also unknowingly inherit liabilities that arise after the acquisition and are not adequately covered by indemnities, and certain stockholders of an acquired company may dissent from or object to an acquisition or otherwise seek to assert claims related to the transaction.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain our current personnel or hire additional personnel, our ability to develop and successfully market our business could be harmed.\nWe believe that our future success is highly dependent on the contributions of our executive officers, as well as our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, including engineers, developers and sales personnel. Since 2013, we have had significant turnover in senior management including a new Chief Executive Officer and a new Chief Financial Officer. It is important that we retain other key personnel following these changes. In addition, qualified individuals that are critical to the success of our current and future business, including engineers, developers and sales personnel, are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. All of our officers and other employees are at-will employees, which means they can terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. Volatility or under-performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract new employees and retain our existing key employees. Our executive officers and employees may be more inclined to leave us if the perceived value of equity awards, including restricted stock units and stock options, decline. If we lose the services of key personnel or do not hire or retain other qualified personnel for key positions, our business and results of operation could be adversely affected. In addition, we do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies for any of our executive officers.\nOur business is subject to online security risks, including cyberattacks and other security breaches, and any actual or perceived security breach could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of our systems, products and services involve the storage and transmission of information regarding our users, customers, and advertising and publishing partners, and our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks, malware or security incidents that result in third parties gaining access to such proprietary\ninformation. An increasing number of websites have recently disclosed online security breaches, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their websites or infrastructure. Our security measures may be breached and unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems and information through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities, fraud, employee error, malfeasance, or inserting malicious code or malware into our code base. For example, in 2014 we determined that an unauthorized individual may have gained access to the user names, email addresses and passwords of certain eHowNow customers. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users, or customers to disclose sensitive information or take other actions by using fraudulent \u201cspoof\u201d and \u201cphishing\u201d emails. Outside parties may also introduce viruses or other malware through \u201ctrojan horse\u201d programs to our users\u2019 computers in order to gain access to our systems and the data stored therein. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may be difficult to detect for a long time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Any security breach or unauthorized access could result in a misappropriation of our proprietary information or the proprietary information of our users, customers or partners, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure, an interruption in our operations and damage to our reputation. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users, customers, advertisers or publishers, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any security breach at a company providing services to us or our users, including third party payment processors, could have similar effects and we may not be fully indemnified for the costs we may incur as a result of any such breach. In addition, we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by a breach, and the coverage limits on our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for any losses caused by security breaches.\nWe are subject to risks and compliance rules and regulations related to the third party credit card payment processing solutions integrated with our websites.\nMany of our customers pay amounts owed to us using a credit card or debit card. For credit and debit card payments, we pay payment processing fees in addition to interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating expenses and adversely affect our net income. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. We believe we and our payment processing service providers are compliant in all material respects with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which incorporates Visa\u2019s Cardholder Information Security Program and MasterCard\u2019s Site Data Protection standard. However, there is no guarantee that such compliance will be maintained or that compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our systems that are integrated with our payment processing providers. If any of our third party payment processors fails to be in compliance with applicable credit card rules and regulations, we may be required to migrate to an alternate payment processor which could result in transaction downtime during the migration and/or a loss of customers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we do not adequately protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position and business may suffer.\nOur intellectual property, consisting of trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, patents and copyrights, is, in the aggregate, important to our business. We rely on a combination of trade secret, trademark, copyright and patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions together with contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights. We rely more heavily on trade secret protection than patent protection. To protect our trade secrets, we control access to our proprietary systems and technology, including our platforms, and we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with other third parties. We face risks related to our intellectual property including that:\n\u00b7\nbecause of the relatively high cost we would experience in registering all of our copyrights with the United States Copyright Office, we generally do not register the copyrights associated with our content;\n\u00b7\nour ability to assert our intellectual property rights against potential competitors or to settle current or future disputes may be limited by our agreements with third parties;\n\u00b7\nour intellectual property rights may not be enforced in jurisdictions where legal protections are weak;\n\u00b7\nany of the patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights that we presently employ in our business could lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or abandoned;\n\u00b7\ncompetitors may design around our protected systems and technology; or\n\u00b7\nwe may lose the ability to assert our intellectual property rights against others.\nEffective protection of our trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, copyrights and patents may not be available in all countries where we currently operate or in which we may operate in the future. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights can be difficult and costly. In addition, it may be necessary to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights through litigation or to defend litigation brought against us, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention and could adversely affect our business, even if we are successful on the merits.\nSome of our software and systems contain open source software, which may pose risks to our proprietary software and solutions.\nWe use open source software in our software and systems and will use open source software in the future. The licenses applicable to open source software typically require that the source code subject to the license be made available to the public and that any modifications or derivative works to open source software continue to be licensed under open source licenses. From time to time, we may face claims from third parties demanding the release or license of the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software (which could include our proprietary source code), claiming infringement of their intellectual property rights, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to purchase a costly license, publicly release the affected portions of our source code, be limited in the licensing of our technologies or cease offering the implicated solutions unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement or change the use of the implicated open source software. In addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties, indemnities or other contractual protections with respect to the software (for example, non-infringement or functionality). Our use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the source code for open source software is publicly available, which may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to breach our sites and systems that rely on open source software. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nThe interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems, or those of third parties that we rely upon, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe availability of our online properties depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Any damage to or failure of our systems, or those of third parties that we rely upon (e.g., co-location providers for data servers, storage devices, and network access), could result in interruptions in our service, which could reduce our revenue and profits, and damage our brand. We have previously experienced certain server outages and computer distributed denial of service attacks, and any future server outages at our data center facilities or distributed denial of service attacks may cause all or portions of our online properties to become unavailable to users. Our systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses or other attempts to harm our systems, and one of our data centers is located in an area with a high risk of major earthquakes. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism, and to potential disruptions if the operators of these facilities have financial difficulties. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is currently underdeveloped and does not account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision to close a facility we are using without adequate notice for financial reasons or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result in lengthy\ninterruptions in our service. Delays or interruptions in our service may cause our users, advertisers, customers and/or artists to become dissatisfied with our offerings and could adversely affect our business.\nFurthermore, third-party service providers may experience an interruption in operations or cease operations for any reason. If we are unable to agree on satisfactory terms for continued data center hosting relationships, we would be forced to enter into a relationship with other service providers or assume hosting responsibilities ourselves. If we are forced to switch hosting facilities, we may not be successful in finding an alternative service provider on acceptable terms or in hosting the computer servers ourselves. We may also be limited in our remedies against these providers in the event of a failure of service. We also rely on third-parties to provide certain components of our technology platform, such as hardware and software providers, and to serve as operators for our content delivery networks, or CDNs. A failure or limitation of service or available capacity by any of these third-party providers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on technology infrastructure and a failure to update or maintain this technology infrastructure, or difficulty scaling and adapting our existing technology and network infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic, could adversely affect our business.\nSignificant portions of our content, products and services are dependent on technology infrastructure that was developed over multiple years. To be successful, our network infrastructure has to perform well and be reliable. The greater the user traffic and the greater the complexity of our products and services, the more computing power we will need. In the future, we may spend substantial amounts to purchase or lease data centers and equipment, upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our online properties and roll out new products and services. Updating and replacing our technology infrastructure could be challenging to implement and manage, take time to test and deploy, cause us to incur substantial costs, cause us to suffer data loss, delays or interruptions in service or result in inefficiencies or operational failures. If we do not successfully update our technology and network infrastructure as needed, or if we experience inefficiencies and operational failures during such updates, the quality of our products and services and our users\u2019 experience could decline. This could damage our reputation and lead us to lose current and potential users, advertisers, customers and artists. Failure to update our technology infrastructure as new technologies become available may also put us in a weaker position relative to a number of our key competitors. Competitors with newer technology infrastructure may have greater flexibility and be in a position to respond more quickly than us to new opportunities, which may impact our competitive position in certain markets and adversely affect our business. The costs associated with any adjustments to our technology and network infrastructure could also harm our operating results. Cost increases, loss of traffic or failure to accommodate new technologies could harm our business, revenue and financial condition.\nRegulations concerning privacy and protection of data could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business and changes in these regulations could diminish the value of our services and cause us to lose visitors and revenue.\nWe receive, process and store large amounts of personal data from users of our online properties, freelance professionals who provide services to us and artists who post artworks or designs on our marketplaces. When a user visits one of our websites or certain pages of our content channel customers\u2019 websites, we use technologies, including \u201ccookies,\u201d to collect information related to the user, such as the user\u2019s Internet Protocol, or IP, address, demographic information, and history of the user\u2019s interactions with content or advertisements previously delivered by us. The information that we collect about our users helps us deliver content and advertising targeted to these users. We post privacy policies on all of our owned and operated websites that set forth our policies and practices related to the collection, use, sharing, disclosure and protection of personal data. The storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personal information and user data are subject to federal, state and international privacy laws, the purpose of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. A variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data that we receive from and about our users. The existing privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. Developments related to \u201cinstant personalization\u201d and similar technologies potentially provide publishers with broader access to, and more detailed information about, users and have led to greater scrutiny of industry data collection practices by regulators and privacy advocates. In addition, new laws may be enacted, new industry self-regulation may be promulgated, or existing laws may be amended or re-\ninterpreted, in a manner that limits our ability to analyze user data. If requirements regarding the manner in which certain personal information and other user data are processed and stored change significantly, our business may be adversely affected, impacting our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the level of privacy required for consumer and other user data we collect. We may also need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches, including encrypting personal information, or remedy breaches after they occur, including notifying each person whose personal data may have been compromised and offering to provide credit monitoring services. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us or various third-party vendors and service providers to comply with applicable privacy policies or with industry standards or laws or regulations could result in a loss of consumer confidence in us, or result in actions against us by governmental entities or others, all of which could potentially cause us to lose consumers and revenue.\nThird parties may sue us for intellectual property infringement or misappropriation or make similar claims which, if successful, could require us to pay significant damages, incur expenses or curtail our offerings.\nWe cannot be certain that our internally developed or acquired systems and technologies do not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. In addition, we license content, software and other intellectual property rights from third parties and may be subject to claims of infringement or misappropriation if such parties do not possess the necessary intellectual property rights to the products or services they license to us. We have in the past and may in the future be subject to legal proceedings and claims that we have infringed the patent or other intellectual property rights of a third party. These claims sometimes involve patent holding companies or other patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may provide little or no deterrence. In addition, third parties may in the future assert intellectual property infringement claims against our customers, which we have agreed in certain circumstances to indemnify and defend against such claims. Any intellectual property-related infringement or misappropriation claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in costly litigation and could divert management resources and attention. If we are found liable for infringement or misappropriation, we may be required to enter into licensing agreements, if available on acceptable terms or at all, pay substantial damages or limit or curtail our systems and technologies. Also, any successful lawsuit against us could subject us to the invalidation of our proprietary rights. Moreover, we may need to redesign some of our systems and technologies to avoid future infringement liability. Any of the foregoing could prevent us from competing effectively and increase our costs.\nAdditionally, our marketplaces allow individuals to sell certain products or their original designs printed on art prints and various consumer products. On occasion, the designs or products posted to our marketplaces, including Society6 or Saatchi Art, may infringe certain copyrights or trademarks or misappropriate the right of publicity of well-known figures. As a result, we may be the subject of letters, lawsuits and takedown notices from rights holders, and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act may not provide safe-harbors for all types of infringing content hosted on these properties. Addressing these types of claims could require us to expend time and resources, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe also license the names \u201cSaatchi\u201d and \u201cLivestrong.com\u201d pursuant to the terms of intellectual property or licensing agreements with third parties, which may be terminated by such third parties if we do not comply with certain requirements in the agreements. If either of these licensing arrangements was terminated, we would experience business disruption and would have to incur significant resources to rebrand the relevant business, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a creator and a distributor of Internet content, we face potential liability and expenses for legal claims based on the nature and subject matter of the content that we create or distribute, or that are accessible via our online properties. If we are required to pay damages or expenses in connection with these legal claims, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\nAs a creator and distributor of original content and third-party provided content, we face potential liability in the United States and abroad based on a variety of theories, including copyright or trademark infringement, defamation, right of publicity, negligence, unlawful practice of a licensed profession and other legal theories based on the nature, creation or distribution of this information, and under various laws, including the Lanham Act and the Copyright Act. We may also be exposed to similar liability in connection with content that we do not create but that is posted to our\nonline properties and to our content channel customers\u2019 online properties by users and other third parties through forums, comments, personas and other social media features. In addition, it is also possible that visitors to our online properties or our content channel customers\u2019 online properties could bring claims against us for losses incurred in reliance upon information provided on such online properties. These claims, regardless of their merit, could divert management time and attention away from our business and result in significant costs to investigate and defend. If we become subject to these or similar types of claims and are not successful in our defense, we may be forced to pay damages, some of which may be substantial. If the content we distribute through our online properties or our content channel customers\u2019 online properties violates the intellectual property rights of others or gives rise to other legal claims against us, we could be subject to substantial liability, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain U.S. and foreign laws and regulations could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad that may subject us to claims or other remedies. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may subject us to additional liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Laws and regulations that are particularly relevant to our business address freedom of expression; information security; privacy and data collection; pricing and fees; employment related matters; online content and the distribution of content, including liability for user reliance on such content; intellectual property rights, including secondary liability for infringement by others; product liability claims; taxation, including VAT and sales tax; and online advertising and marketing, including email marketing and unsolicited commercial email. See \u201c - Regulations concerning privacy and protection of data could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business and changes in these regulations could diminish the value of our services and cause us to lose visitors and revenue.\u201d\nIn the United States, Congress has adopted legislation that regulates certain aspects of the Internet, including the Communications Decency Act, the Digital Millenium Copyright Act, the Lanham Act, the CAN-SPAM Act and the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act. Advertising and promotional information presented to visitors on our online properties and our other marketing activities are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws that regulate unfair and deceptive practices. Many applicable laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet. Moreover, the applicability and scope of the laws that do address the Internet remain uncertain. For example, the laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are evolving. Claims have been either threatened or filed against us under both U.S. and foreign laws for defamation, copyright infringement, patent infringement, privacy violations, cybersquatting, trademark infringement and discrimination. In the future, claims may also be brought against us based on tort law liability and other theories based on our content, products and services or content generated by our users.\nWe must also comply with certain foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations. Our business operations in countries outside the United States are subject to a number of U.S. federal laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and economic and trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) and the U.S. Commerce Department based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states, organizations and individuals. The FCPA is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials or parties and requires public companies in the United States to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect those companies\u2019 transactions. OFAC regulations prohibit U.S.-based entities from entering into or facilitating transactions with, for the benefit of, or involving the property of, persons, governments or countries designated by the U.S. government under one or more sanctions regimes, which could include transactions that provide a benefit that is received in an OFAC designated country. Additionally, some of the products and services we provide to customers globally may require approval under applicable U.S. export law.\nVAT, sales and use, and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. We do not collect such taxes in every jurisdiction in which we have sales based on our belief that such taxes are not applicable. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect VAT, sales and use, or similar taxes on our sales may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest for prior periods, and a requirement to collect such taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest, or future requirements, including implementing products and\ntechnologies to calculate, collect and remit such taxes, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe costs of compliance with these regulations may increase in the future as a result of changes in the regulations or the interpretation of them. Further, if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be exposed to claims for damages, financial penalties, reputational harm, incarceration of our employees or restrictions on our operations, which could increase our costs of operations, reduce our profits or cause us to forgo opportunities that would otherwise support our growth.\nChanges in state, federal or international taxation laws and regulations may adversely affect our business.\nDue to the global nature of the Internet, it is possible that, although our services and the Internet transmissions related to them typically originate in Nevada and California, governments of other states or foreign countries might attempt to regulate our transmissions or levy sales, income or other taxes relating to our activities. Tax authorities at the international, federal, state and local levels are also currently reviewing the appropriate treatment of companies engaged in Internet commerce. New or revised international, federal, state or local tax regulations may subject us or our customers to additional sales, income, VAT and other taxes. We cannot predict the effect of current attempts to impose sales, income, VAT or other taxes on commerce over the Internet. New or revised taxes and, in particular, additional sales taxes or VAT, would likely increase the cost of doing business online and decrease the attractiveness of advertising and selling goods and services over the Internet. New taxes could also create significant increases in internal costs necessary to capture data and collect and remit taxes. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may not succeed in expanding our businesses internationally, which may limit our future growth, and operating internationally exposes us to certain additional risks and operating costs.\nOne potential area of growth for our business is internationally. The artwork and designs sold through our art and design marketplaces are created by a global community of artists and sold to customers around the world. We are also exploring translating and localizing our Society6 marketplace site into certain foreign languages. We have an eHow site in the United Kingdom, as well as eHow en Espa\u00f1ol, Livestrong.com en Espa\u00f1ol and eHow Brasil (Spanish and Portuguese language sites that target both the U.S. and the worldwide Spanish/Portuguese-speaking markets). We cannot be certain that we will be successful in introducing beyond the markets we currently serve or marketing our products and services internationally or that our products and services will gain market acceptance. If we are unable to expand and market our products and services internationally, it could have a negative effect on our future growth prospects. There are also risks inherent in conducting business in international markets, including the need to localize our products and services to foreign customers\u2019 preferences and customs, difficulties in managing operations due to language barriers, distance, staffing and cultural differences, application of foreign laws and regulations to us, tariffs and other trade barriers, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, establishing management and financial systems and infrastructures, reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries, changes in foreign political and economic conditions, and potentially adverse tax consequences. Operating internationally, where we have limited experience, exposes us to additional risks and operating costs that may outweigh the financial and other benefits of operating in such markets.\nA reclassification by tax authorities of any freelance professionals we currently or have previously contracted with from independent contractors to employees could require us to pay retroactive taxes and penalties and significantly increase our cost of operations.\nWe previously contracted with freelance professionals to create the substantial majority of the content for our online properties and we continue to contract with freelance professionals for various purposes, including to develop, create and edit content, and otherwise contribute to the content creation process, for our and our content channel customers\u2019 online properties. Because we consider the freelance professionals who we contract with or have contracted with to be independent contractors, as opposed to employees, we do not withhold federal or state income or other employment related taxes, make federal or state unemployment tax or Federal Insurance Contributions Act payments, or provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance with respect to such freelance professionals. Our contracts with freelance professionals that are classified as\nindependent contractors obligate the freelance professionals to pay these taxes. The classification of freelance professionals as independent contractors depends on the specific facts and circumstances of each relationship. In the event of a determination by federal or state taxing authorities that any freelance professionals we engage or have engaged as independent contractors are employees, we may be adversely affected and subject to retroactive taxes and penalties. In addition, if the freelance professionals we categorize as independent contractors were deemed to be employees, our costs associated with content creation could increase significantly, we could potentially incur fines, penalties or other damages, and our financial results would be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Owning Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and an active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to be, highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. For example, from the date of our initial public offering in January 2011 through February 24, 2016, our closing stock price, as adjusted for the Distribution and the 1-for-5 reverse stock split, has ranged from $4.05 to $48.75. As a result of the reverse stock split reducing the number of shares of our common stock that are outstanding, we may have a lower average daily trading volume, which could also lead to greater volatility in the trading price of our common stock or a less liquid market for our stock to trade. In addition, an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained, which could depress the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this report, factors that may cause the trading price of our common stock to be volatile include:\n\u00b7\nour operating performance and the operating performance of similar companies;\n\u00b7\nthe overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u00b7\nthe number of shares of our common stock publicly owned and available for trading;\n\u00b7\nany major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u00b7\npublication of research reports about us or our industries or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\npublication of third-party reports relating to the performance of our business or certain key operating metrics;\n\u00b7\nlarge volumes of sales of our shares of common stock by existing stockholders; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral political and economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for Internet-related companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources and harm our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nThe large number of shares eligible for public sale or subject to rights requiring us to register them for public sale could depress the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price of our common stock. As of February 24, 2016, we had 20,250,726 shares of common stock outstanding (excluding shares held in treasury).\nCertain stockholders owning a significant amount of our outstanding shares of common stock are party to a stockholders agreement that entitles them to require us to register shares of our common stock owned by them for public sale in the United States, subject to the restrictions of Rule 144. In addition, certain stockholders, including investors in our preferred stock that converted into common stock as well as current and former employees, are eligible to resell shares of common stock under Rule 144 and Rule 701 without registering such shares with the SEC. Sales of our common stock as restrictions end or pursuant to registration rights may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales also could cause our stock price to fall and make it more difficult for shareholders to sell shares of our common stock.\nIn addition, as of February 24, 2016 we have over ten million shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans, of which approximately five million shares are registered under our registration statement on Form S-8 on file with the SEC. Subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods, vesting requirements and, in certain cases, performance conditions, the shares of registered common stock issued upon exercise of outstanding options, vesting of future awards or pursuant to purchases under our employee stock purchase plan (the \u201cESPP\u201d) will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open market. We also have previously and may from time to time in the future issue shares of our common stock as consideration for acquisitions and investments. If any such acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares that we may issue may in turn be significant.\nOur stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.\nOur board of directors previously approved a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $50.0 million of our common stock, of which approximately $19.2 million remains available as of December 31, 2015. Such stock repurchases may be limited, suspended, or terminated at any time without prior notice, and we have not repurchased any shares of our common stock since April 2013. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program or that any future repurchases will have a positive impact on the trading price of our common stock or earnings per share. Important factors that could cause us to limit, suspend or terminate our stock repurchase program include, among others, unfavorable market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, the nature of other investment or strategic opportunities presented to us from time to time, the rate of dilution of our equity compensation programs, the availability of adequate funds, and our ability to make appropriate, timely, and beneficial decisions as to when, how, and whether to purchase shares under the stock repurchase program. If we limit, suspend or terminate our stock repurchase program, our stock price may be negatively affected.\nAs a public company, we are subject to compliance initiatives that require substantial time from our management and result in significantly increased costs.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, and other rules implemented by the SEC and the NYSE, impose various requirements on public companies, including requirements related to certain corporate governance practices. Compliance with these rules and regulations has resulted in significantly increased costs for us as a public company than we incurred as a private company, including substantially higher costs to obtain comparable levels of director and officer liability insurance. Proposed corporate governance laws and regulations under consideration may further increase our compliance costs. If compliance with these various legal and regulatory requirements diverts our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, these laws and regulations may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors, on committees of our board of directors, or as executive officers.\nWe are required to make an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We are also required to obtain an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm. Section 404 requires us to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for each fiscal year. Our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. If we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404, management may not be able to assess whether our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, which may subject us to adverse regulatory consequences and could result in a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. In addition, if we fail to maintain effective controls and procedures, we may be unable to provide the required financial information in a timely and reliable manner or otherwise comply with the standards applicable to us as a public company. Any failure by us to provide the required financial information in a timely and reliable manner could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and the trading price of our securities. In addition, we may incur additional expenses and commitment of management\u2019s time in connection with further assessments of our compliance with the requirements of Section 404, which could materially increase our operating expenses and adversely impact our results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends and, accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the future. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur, will provide a return to stockholders. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock.\nCertain provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors, including, among other things:\n\u00b7\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u00b7\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our board of directors to determine to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;\n\u00b7\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u00b7\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u00b7\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the president (in absence of a Chief Executive Officer) or our board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u00b7\nthe requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to the issuance of preferred stock and management of our business or our amended and restated bylaws, which may inhibit the ability of an acquiror from amending our certificate of incorporation or bylaws to facilitate a hostile acquisition;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend the bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent a hostile acquisition and inhibit the ability of an acquiror from amending the bylaws to facilitate a hostile acquisition; and\n\u00b7\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nWe are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, our board of directors has approved the transaction.", "PERMNO": 12521, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "LEAF"}
