{"cik": "1286613", "company": "LINCOLN EDUCATIONAL SERVICES CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe risk factors described below and other information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are among the numerous risks faced by our Company and should be carefully considered before deciding to invest in, sell or retain shares of our common stock. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and, as such, should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY\nOur failure to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements for participation in Title IV Programs and school operations could result in financial penalties, restrictions on our operations and loss of external financial aid funding, which could affect our revenues and impose significant operating restrictions on us.\nOur industry is highly regulated by federal and state governmental agencies and by accrediting commissions. In particular, the HEA and DOE regulations specify extensive criteria and numerous standards that an institution must satisfy to establish to participate in the Title IV Programs. For a description of these criteria, see Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment.\u201d\nIf we are found not to have satisfied the DOE\u2019s requirements for Title IV Programs funding, one or more of our institutions, including its additional locations, could be limited in its access to, or lose, Title IV Program funding, which could adversely affect our revenue, as we received approximately 78% of our revenue (calculated based on cash receipts) from Title IV Programs in 2019, and have a significant impact on our business and results of operations. Furthermore, if any of our schools fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the school and its related main campus and/or additional locations could be subject to, among other things, the loss of state licensure or accreditation, the loss of eligibility to participate in and receive funds under the Title IV Programs, the loss of the ability to grant degrees, diplomas and certificates, provisional certification, or the imposition of liabilities or monetary penalties, any of which could adversely affect our revenues and impose significant operating restrictions upon us. In addition, the loss by any of our schools of its accreditation, its state authorization or license, or its eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs would constitute an event of default under our credit agreement with our lender, which could result in the acceleration of all amounts then outstanding with respect to our outstanding loan obligations. The various regulatory agencies applicable to our business periodically revise their requirements and modify their interpretations of existing requirements and restrictions. We cannot predict with certainty how any of these regulatory requirements will be applied or whether each of our schools will be able to comply with these requirements or any additional requirements instituted in the future.\nIf we fail to demonstrate \u201cadministrative capability\u201d to the DOE, our business could suffer.\nDOE regulations specify extensive criteria an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite \u201cadministrative capability\u201d to participate in Title IV Programs. For a description of these criteria, see Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment - Administrative Capability.\u201d\nIf we are found not to have satisfied the DOE\u2019s \u201cadministrative capability\u201d requirements, or otherwise failed to comply with one or more DOE requirements, one or more of our institutions, including its additional locations, could be limited in its access to, or lose, Title IV Program funding. A loss or decrease in Title IV Program funding could adversely affect our revenue, as we received approximately 78% of our revenue (calculated based on cash receipts) from Title IV Programs in 2019, which would have a significant impact on our business and results of operations.\nCongress and the DOE may make changes to the laws and regulations applicable to, or reduce funding for, Title IV Programs, which could reduce our student population, revenues or profit margin.\nCongress periodically revises the HEA and other laws governing Title IV Programs and annually determines the funding level for each Title IV Program. We cannot predict what if any legislative or other actions will be taken or proposed by Congress in connection with the reauthorization of the HEA or with other activities of Congress. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment - Congressional Action.\u201d Because a significant percentage of our revenues are derived from the Title IV Programs, any action by Congress or the DOE that significantly reduces funding for Title IV Programs or that limits or restricts the ability of our schools, programs, or students to receive funding through those Title IV Programs or that imposes new restrictions or constraints upon our business or operations could reduce our student enrollment and our revenues, and could increase our administrative costs and require us to modify our practices in order for our schools to comply fully with Title IV Program requirements. In addition, current requirements for student or school participation in Title IV Programs may change or one or more of the present Title IV Programs could be replaced by other programs with materially different student or school eligibility requirements. If we cannot comply with the provisions of the HEA, as they may be revised, or if the cost of such compliance is excessive, or if funding is materially reduced, our revenues or profit margin could be materially adversely affected.\nIndex\nThe DOE has changed its regulations, and may make other changes in the future, in a manner which could require us to incur additional costs in connection with our administration of the Title IV Programs, affect our ability to remain eligible to participate in the Title IV Programs, impose restrictions on our participation in the Title IV Programs, affect the rate at which students enroll in our programs, or otherwise have a significant impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn January 2016, the DOE began negotiated rulemaking to develop proposed regulations regarding a borrower\u2019s ability to allege acts or omissions by an institution as a defense to the repayment of certain Title IV Program loans and the consequences to the borrower, the DOE, and the institution. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment - Borrower Defense to Repayment Regulations.\u201d On November 1, 2016, the DOE published in the Federal Register the final version of these regulations with a general effective date of July 1, 2017 and which, among other things, include rules for:\n\u2022\nestablishing new processes, and updating existing processes, for enabling borrowers to obtain from the DOE a discharge of some or all of their federal student loans based on circumstances such as certain acts or omissions of the institution and for the DOE to impose and collect liabilities against the institution following the loan discharges;\n\u2022\nestablishing expanded standards of financial responsibility (see \u201cRegulatory Environment - Financial Responsibility Standards\u201d);\n\u2022\nrequiring institutions to make disclosures to current and prospective students regarding the existence of certain of the circumstances identified in the expanded standards of financial responsibility;\n\u2022\ncalculating a loan repayment rate for each proprietary institution under standards established by the regulations and requiring institutions to provide warnings to current and prospective students if the institution has a loan repayment rate below specified thresholds;\n\u2022\nprohibiting certain contractual provisions imposed by or on behalf of schools on students regarding arbitration, dispute resolution, and participation in class actions; and\n\u2022\nexpanding the existing definition of misrepresentations that could result in grounds for discharge of student loans and in liabilities and sanctions against the institution, including, without limitation, potential loss of Title IV Program eligibility.\nOn January 19, 2017, the DOE issued new regulations that update the DOE\u2019s hearing procedures for actions to establish liability against an institution and to establish procedural rules governing recovery proceedings under the DOE\u2019s borrower defense to repayment regulations.\nThe DOE had delayed the effective date of a majority of these regulations until July 1, 2019 to ensure that there is adequate time to conduct negotiated rulemaking and, as necessary, develop revised regulations. However, a federal court ruled that the delay in the effective date of the regulations was unlawful and, on October 16, 2018, denied a request to extend a stay preventing the regulations from taking effect, and the DOE has published subsequent guidance regarding how it is implementing these regulations. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment - Borrower Defense to Repayment Regulations\u201d and \u201cRegulatory Environment - Financial Responsibility Standards.\u201d\nThe DOE published proposed regulations on July 31, 2018 that would modify the defense to repayment regulations. On September 23, 2019, the DOE published the final regulations which have a general effective date of July 1, 2020. The current regulations generally will remain in effect until the new regulations generally take effect on July 1, 2020. Among other things, the new regulations amend the processes for borrowers to receive from DOE a discharge of the obligation to repay certain Title IV Program loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2020 based on certain acts or omissions by the institution or a covered party. The regulations establish detailed procedures and standards for the loan discharge processes, including the information required for borrowers to receive a loan discharge, and the authority of the DOE to seek recovery from the institution of the amount of discharged loans. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment - Borrower Defense to Repayment Regulations.\u201d The regulations also modify the list of triggering events that could result in the DOE determining that the institution lacks financial responsibility and must submit to the DOE a letter of credit or other form of acceptable financial protection and accept other conditions on the institution\u2019s Title IV Program eligibility. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment - Financial Responsibility Standards.\u201d The final regulations also will eliminate the current regulations regarding loan repayment rate warning requirements and generally will permit the use of arbitration clauses and class action waivers while requiring institutions to make certain disclosures to students.\nWe cannot predict how the DOE would interpret and enforce current or future borrower defense to repayment rules or how these rules, or any rules that may arise out of a negotiated rulemaking process or any other rules that DOE may promulgate on this or other topics, may impact our schools\u2019 participation in the Title IV Programs; however, current or future rules could have a material adverse effect on our schools\u2019 business and results of operations, and the broad sweep of the recent rules may, in the future, require our schools to submit a letter of credit based on expanded standards of financial responsibility.\nThe DOE published a notice in the Federal Register on October 15, 2018 announcing its intent to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee and three subcommittees to develop proposed regulations related to several matters, and subsequently released draft proposed regulations that covered additional topics including, but not limited to, amendments to current regulations regarding the clock to credit hour conversion formula for measuring the lengths of certain educational programs, the return of unearned Title IV Program funds received for students who withdraw before completing their educational programs, and the measurement of student academic progress. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment - Negotiated Rulemaking.\u201d The committee and subcommittees completed their meetings in April 2019 and reached consensus on draft proposed regulations. On June 12, 2019, the DOE published proposed regulations on some of the topics in a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register for public comment and to consider revisions to the regulations in response to the comments before publishing final versions of the regulations. The DOE stated that it intends to publish proposed regulations on the remaining issues in a separate notice of proposed rulemaking, but did not indicate when it would publish those proposed changes. On November 1, 2019, the DOE published the final regulations. The regulations have a general effective date of July 1, 2020. We are in the process of analyzing the new regulations and their potential impact on us and our institutions.\nIndex\nIf we or our eligible institutions do not meet the financial responsibility standards prescribed by the DOE, we may be required to post letters of credit or our eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs could be terminated or limited, which could significantly reduce our student population and revenues.\nTo participate in Title IV Programs, an eligible institution must satisfy specific measures of financial responsibility prescribed by the DOE or post a letter of credit in favor of the DOE and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in Title IV Programs. The DOE published new regulations that establish expanded standards of financial responsibility that could result in a requirement that we submit to the DOE a substantial letter of credit or other form of financial protection in an amount determined by the DOE, and be subject to other conditions and requirements, based on any one of an extensive list of triggering circumstances. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment - Financial Responsibility Standards.\u201d Any obligation to post one or more letters of credit would increase our costs of regulatory compliance. Our inability to obtain a required letter of credit or limitations on, or termination of, our participation in Title IV Programs could limit our students\u2019 access to various government-sponsored student financial aid programs, which could significantly reduce our student population and revenues.\nWe are subject to fines and other sanctions if we pay impermissible commissions, bonuses or other incentive payments to individuals involved in certain recruiting, admissions or financial aid activities, which could increase our cost of regulatory compliance and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAn institution participating in Title IV Programs may not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in enrolling students or securing financial aid to any person involved in any student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the awarding of Title IV Program funds. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment -- Restrictions\non Payment of Commissions, Bonuses and Other Incentive Payments.\u201d We cannot predict how the DOE will interpret and enforce the incentive compensation rule. The implementation of these regulations has required us to change our compensation practices and has had and may continue to have a significant impact on the rate at which students enroll in our programs and on our business and results of operations. If we are found to have violated this law, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by the DOE or we could face litigation filed under the qui tam provisions of the Federal False Claims Act.\nIf our schools do not maintain their accreditation, they may not participate in Title IV Programs, which could adversely affect our student population and revenues.\nAn institution must be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by the DOE in order to participate in Title IV Programs. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment - Accreditation.\u201d Our schools are currently on financial reporting status with ACCSC. If any of our schools fails to comply with accrediting commission requirements, the institution and its main and/or branch campuses are subject to the loss of accreditation or may be placed on probation or a special monitoring or reporting status which, if the noncompliance with accrediting commission requirements is not resolved, could result in loss of accreditation. Loss of accreditation by any of our main campuses would result in the termination of eligibility of that school and all of its branch campuses to participate in Title IV Programs and could cause us to close the school and its branches, which could have a significant adverse impact on our business and operations.\nProgrammatic accreditation is the process through which specific programs are reviewed and approved by industry- and program-specific accrediting entities. Although programmatic accreditation is not generally necessary for Title IV Program eligibility, such accreditation may be required to allow students to sit for certain licensure exams or to work in a particular profession or career or to meet other requirements. Failure to obtain or maintain such programmatic accreditation may lead to a decline in enrollments in such programs.\nOur institutions would lose eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs if the percentage of their revenues derived from those programs exceeds 90%, which could reduce our student population and revenues.\nA proprietary institution that derives more than 90% of its total revenue from Title IV Programs for two consecutive fiscal years becomes immediately ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs and may not reapply for eligibility until the end of at least two fiscal years. An institution with revenues exceeding 90% for a single fiscal year will be placed on provisional certification and may be subject to other enforcement measures. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment - 90/10 Rule.\u201d If any of our institutions loses eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, that loss would cause an event of default under our credit agreement, would also adversely affect our students\u2019 access to various government-sponsored student financial aid programs, and would have a significant impact on the rate at which our students enroll in our programs and on our business and results of operations.\nIndex\nOur institutions would lose eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs if their former students defaulted on repayment of their federal student loans in excess of specified levels, which could reduce our student population and revenues.\nAn institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV Programs if the rates at which the institution\u2019s current and former students default on their federal student loans exceed specified percentages. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment - Student Loan Defaults.\u201d If former students defaulted on repayment of their federal student loans in excess of specified levels, our institutions would lose eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, would cause an event of default under our credit agreement, would also adversely affect our students\u2019 access to various government-sponsored student financial aid programs, and would have a significant impact on the rate at which our students enroll in our programs and on our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to sanctions if we fail to correctly calculate and timely return Title IV Program funds for students who withdraw before completing their educational program, which could increase our cost of regulatory compliance and decrease our profit margin.\nAn institution participating in Title IV Programs must correctly calculate the amount of unearned Title IV Program funds that have been credited to students who withdraw from their educational programs before completing them and must return those unearned funds in a timely manner, generally within 45 days of the date the institution determines that the student has withdrawn. If the unearned funds are not properly calculated and timely returned, we may have to post a letter of credit in favor of the DOE or may be otherwise sanctioned by the DOE, which could increase our cost of regulatory compliance and adversely affect our results of operations. Based upon the findings of an annual Title IV Program compliance audit of our Columbia, Maryland and Iselin, New Jersey institutions, the Company submitted letters of credit in the amounts of $0.5 million and $0.1 million to the DOE. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment - Return of Title IV Program Funds.\u201d\nWe are subject to sanctions if we fail to comply with the DOE\u2019s regulations regarding prohibitions against substantial misrepresentations, which could increase our cost of regulatory compliance and decrease our profit margin.\nThe DOE\u2019s regulations prohibit an institution that participates in the Title IV Programs from engaging in substantial misrepresentation of the nature of its educational programs, financial charges, graduate employability or its relationship with the DOE. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment - Substantial Misrepresentation.\u201d If the DOE determines that one of our institutions has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, the DOE may impose sanctions or other conditions upon the institution including, but not limited to, initiating an action to fine the institution or limit, suspend, or terminate its eligibility to participate in the Title IV Programs and may seek to discharge students\u2019 loans and impose liabilities upon the institution.\nSeveral of our institutions are provisionally certified by the DOE which may make them more vulnerable to unfavorable DOE action and place additional regulatory burdens on its operations.\nOur Indianapolis, Indiana, Columbia, Maryland, and New Britain, Connecticut institutions are provisionally certified by the DOE. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment - Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs.\u201d The DOE typically places an institution on provisional certification following a change in ownership resulting in a change of control, and may provisionally certify an institution for other reasons including, but not limited to, failure to comply with certain standards of administrative capability or financial responsibility. During the time when an institution is provisionally certified, it may be subject to adverse action with fewer due process rights than those afforded to other institutions. In addition, an institution that is provisionally certified must apply for and receive approval from the DOE for certain substantive changes including, but not limited to, the establishment of an additional location, an increase in the level of academic offerings or the addition of certain programs. Any adverse action by the DOE or increased regulatory burdens as a result of the provisional status of one of our institutions could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nRegulatory agencies or third parties may conduct compliance reviews, bring claims or initiate litigation against us. If the results of these reviews or claims are unfavorable to us, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nBecause we operate in a highly regulated industry, we are subject to compliance reviews and claims of noncompliance and lawsuits by government agencies and third parties. We may be subject to further reviews related to, among other things, issues of noncompliance identified in recent audits and reviews related to our institutions\u2019 compliance with Title IV requirements or related to liabilities for the discharge of loans to certain students who attended campuses of our institutions that are now closed. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment - Compliance with Regulatory Standards and Effect of Regulatory Violations.\u201d If the results of these reviews or proceedings are unfavorable to us, or if we are unable to defend successfully against third-party lawsuits or claims, we may be required to pay money damages or be subject to fines, limitations on the operations of our business, loss of federal and state funding, injunctions or other penalties. Even if we adequately address issues raised by an agency review or successfully defend a third-party lawsuit or claim, we may have to divert significant financial and management resources from our ongoing business operations to address issues raised by those reviews or defend those lawsuits or claims. Certain of our institutions are subject to ongoing reviews and proceedings. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment - State Authorization,\u201d \u201cRegulatory Environment - Accreditation,\u201d and \u201cRegulatory Environment - Compliance with Regulatory Standards and Effect of Regulatory Violations.\u201d\nIndex\nA decline in the overall growth of enrollment in post-secondary institutions, or in our core disciplines, could cause us to experience lower enrollment at our schools, which could negatively impact our future growth.\nEnrollment in post-secondary institutions over the next ten years is expected to be slower than in the prior ten years. In addition, the number of high school graduates eligible to enroll in post-secondary institutions is expected to fall before resuming a growth pattern for the foreseeable future. In order to increase our current growth rates in degree granting programs, we will need to attract a larger percentage of students in existing markets and expand our markets by creating new academic programs. In addition, if job growth in the fields related to our core disciplines is weaker than expected, as a result of any regional or national economic downturn or otherwise, fewer students may seek the types of diploma or degree granting programs that we offer or seek to offer. Our failure to attract new students, or the decisions by prospective students to seek diploma or degree programs in other disciplines, would have an adverse impact on our future growth.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by additional legislation, regulations, or investigations regarding private student lending because students attending our schools rely on private student loans to pay tuition and other institutional charges.\nThe U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, has exercised supervisory authority over private education loan providers. The CFPB has been active in conducting investigations into the private student loan market and issuing several reports with findings that are critical of the private student loan market. The CFPB has initiated investigations into the lending practices of other institutions in the for-profit education sector.\nWe cannot predict whether any of this activity, or other activities, will result in Congress, the DOE, the CFPB or other regulators adopting new legislation or regulations, or conducting new investigations, into the private student loan market or into the loans received by our students to attend our institutions. Any new legislation, regulations, or investigations regarding private student lending could limit the availability of private student loans to our students, which could have a significant impact on our business and operations.\nChanges in the executive branch of our federal government as a result of the outcome of elections or other events could result in further legislation, appropriations, regulations and enforcement actions that could materially or adversely affect our business.\nOur industry is subject to an intensive ongoing federal and state regulatory environment that affects our industry. The composition of federal and state executive offices, executive agencies and legislatures that are subject to change based on the results of elections, appointments and other events, may adversely impact our industry through constant changes in that regulatory environment resulting from the disparate views towards the for-profit education industry.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nOur success depends in part on our ability to update and expand the content of existing programs and develop new programs in a cost-effective manner and on a timely basis.\nProspective employers of our graduates increasingly demand that their entry-level employees possess appropriate technological skills. These skills are becoming more sophisticated in line with technological advancements in the automotive, diesel, information technology, and skilled trades. Accordingly, educational programs at our schools must keep pace with those technological advancements. The expansion of our existing programs and the development of new programs may not be accepted by our students, prospective employers or the technical education market. Even if we are able to develop acceptable new programs, we may not be able to introduce these new programs as quickly as our competitors or as quickly as employers demand. If we are unable to adequately respond to changes in market requirements due to financial constraints, unusually rapid technological changes or other factors, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired, our placement rates could suffer and our revenues could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, if we are unable to adequately anticipate the requirements of the employers we serve, we may offer programs that do not teach skills useful to prospective employers or students seeking a technical or career-oriented education which could affect our placement rates and our ability to attract and retain students, causing our revenues to be adversely affected.\nCompetition could decrease our market share and cause us to lower our tuition rates.\nThe post-secondary education market is highly competitive. Our schools compete for students and faculty with traditional public and private two-year and four-year colleges and universities and other proprietary schools, many of which have greater financial resources than we do. Some traditional public and private colleges and universities, as well as other private career-oriented schools, offer programs that may be perceived by students to be similar to ours. Most public institutions are able to charge lower tuition than our schools, due in part to government subsidies and other financial resources not available to for-profit schools. Some of our competitors also have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have which may, among other things, allow our competitors to secure strategic relationships with some or all of our existing strategic partners or develop other high profile strategic relationships, or devote more resources to expanding their programs and their school network, or provide greater financing alternatives to their students, all of which could affect the success of our marketing programs. In addition, some of our competitors have a larger network of schools and campuses than we do, enabling them to recruit students more effectively from a wider geographic area. If we are unable to compete effectively with these institutions for students, our student enrollment and revenues will be adversely affected.\nIndex\nWe may be required to reduce tuition or increase spending in response to competition in order to retain or attract students or pursue new market opportunities. As a result, our market share, revenues and operating margin may be decreased. We cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur financial performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop awareness and acceptance of our programs among high school graduates and working adults looking to return to school.\nThe awareness of our programs among high school graduates and working adults looking to return to school is critical to the continued acceptance and growth of our programs. Our inability to continue to develop awareness of our programs could reduce our enrollments and impair our ability to increase our revenues or maintain profitability. The following are some of the factors that could prevent us from successfully marketing our programs:\n\u2022\nStudent dissatisfaction with our programs and services;\n\u2022\nDiminished access to high school student populations;\n\u2022\nOur failure to maintain or expand our brand or other factors related to our marketing or advertising practices; and\n\u2022\nOur inability to maintain relationships with employers in the automotive, diesel, skilled trades and IT services industries.\nAn increase in interest rates could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain students.\nOur students and their families have benefitted from historic lows on student loan interest rates in recent years. Much of the financing our students receive is tied to floating interest rates. Recently, however, student loan interest rates have been edging higher, making borrowing for education more expensive. Increases in interest rates result in a corresponding increase in the cost to our existing and prospective students of financing their education, which could result in a reduction in the number of students attending our schools and could adversely affect our results of operations and revenues. Higher interest rates could also contribute to higher default rates with respect to our students\u2019 repayment of their education loans. Higher default rates may in turn adversely impact our eligibility for Title IV Program participation or the willingness of private lenders to make private loan programs available to students who attend our schools, which could result in a reduction in our student population.\nA substantial decrease in student financing options, or a significant increase in financing costs for our students, could have a significant impact on our student population, revenues and financial results.\nThe consumer credit markets in the United States have recently suffered from increases in default rates and foreclosures on mortgages. Adverse market conditions for consumer and federally guaranteed student loans could result in providers of alternative loans reducing the attractiveness and/or decreasing the availability of alternative loans to post-secondary students, including students with low credit scores who would not otherwise be eligible for credit-based alternative loans. Prospective students may find that these increased financing costs make borrowing prohibitively expensive and abandon or delay enrollment in post-secondary education programs. Private lenders could also require that we pay them new or increased fees in order to provide alternative loans to prospective students. If any of these scenarios were to occur, our students\u2019 ability to finance their education could be adversely affected and our student population could decrease, which could have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, any actions by the U.S. Congress or by states that significantly reduce funding for Title IV Programs or other student financial assistance programs, or the ability of our students to participate in these programs, or establish different or more stringent requirements for our schools to participate in those programs, could have a significant impact on our student population, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur total assets include substantial intangible assets. In the event that our schools do not achieve satisfactory operating results, we may be required to write-off a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets which would negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur total assets reflect substantial intangible assets. At December 31, 2019, goodwill associated with our acquisitions decreased to approximately 7.5% from 10.0% of total assets at December 31, 2018. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of goodwill. If the carrying value of the tested asset exceeds its estimated fair value, impairment is deemed to have occurred. In this event, the amount is written down to fair value. Under current accounting rules, this would result in a charge to operating earnings. Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, which could be material.\nIndex\nWe cannot predict our future capital needs, and if we are unable to secure additional financing when needed, our operations and revenues would be adversely affected.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future to fund acquisitions, working capital requirements, expand our markets and program offerings or respond to competitive pressures or perceived opportunities. We cannot be sure that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available when required or on acceptable terms, we may be forced to forego attractive acquisition opportunities, cease our operations and, even if we are able to continue our operations, our ability to increase student enrollment and revenues would be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to retain our key personnel or hire and retain the personnel we need to sustain and grow our business.\nOur success has depended, and will continue to depend, largely on the skills, efforts and motivation of our executive officers who generally have significant experience within the post-secondary education industry. Our success also depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified faculty, school directors, administrators and corporate management. Due to the nature of our business, we face significant competition in the attraction and retention of personnel who possess the skill sets that we seek. In addition, key personnel may leave us and subsequently compete against us. Furthermore, we do not currently carry \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance on any of our employees. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms, could have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business efficiently and to execute our growth strategy.\nStrikes by our employees may disrupt our ability to hold classes as well as our ability to attract and retain students, which could materially adversely affect our operations. In addition, we contribute to multiemployer benefit plans that could result in liabilities to us if these plans are terminated or we withdraw from them.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the teaching professionals at six of our campuses are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2020 and 2022. Although we believe that we have good relationships with these unions and with our employees, any strikes or work stoppages by our employees could adversely impact our relationships with our students, hinder our ability to conduct business and increase costs.\nWe also contribute to multiemployer pension plans for some employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. These plans are not administered by us, and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon employers who are contributors to a multiemployer plan in the event of the employer\u2019s withdrawal from, or upon termination of, such plan. We do not routinely review information on the net assets and actuarial present value of the multiemployer pension plans\u2019 unfunded vested benefits allocable to us, if any, and we are not presently aware of any material amounts for which we may be contingently liable if we were to withdraw from any of these plans. In addition, if any of these multiemployer plans enters \u201ccritical status\u201d under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, we could be required to make significant additional contributions to those plans.\nSystem disruptions to our technology infrastructure could impact our ability to generate revenue and could damage the reputation of our institutions.\nThe performance and reliability of our technology infrastructure is critical to our reputation and to our ability to attract and retain students. We license the software and related hosting and maintenance services for our online platform and our student information system from third-party software providers. Any system error or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in bandwidth usage, could result in the unavailability of systems to us or our students or result in delays and/or errors in processing student financial aid and related disbursements. Any such system disruptions could impact our ability to generate revenue and affect our ability to access information about our students and could also damage the reputation of our institutions. Any of the cyber-attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations, result in theft of our and our students\u2019 data or result in legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased cost for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against system errors, failures or disruptions or to repair problems caused by any actual errors, disruptions or failures.\nWe are subject to privacy and information security laws and regulations due to our collection and use of personal information, and any violations of those laws or regulations, or any breach, theft or loss of that information, could adversely affect our reputation and operations.\nOur efforts to attract and enroll students result in us collecting, using and storing substantial amounts of personal information regarding applicants, our students, their families and alumni, including social security numbers and financial data. We also maintain personal information about our employees in the ordinary course of our activities. Our services, the services of many of our health plan and benefit plan vendors, and other information can be accessed globally through the Internet. We rely extensively on our network of interconnected applications and databases for day to day operations as well as financial reporting and the processing of financial transactions. Our computer networks and those of our vendors that manage confidential information for us or provide services to our student may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks and breaches, acts of vandalism, ransomware, software viruses and other similar types of malicious activities. Regular patching of our computer systems and frequent updates to our virus detection and prevention software with the latest virus and malware signatures may not catch newly introduced malware and viruses or \u201czero-day\u201d viruses, prior to their infecting our systems and potentially disrupting our data integrity, taking sensitive information or affecting financial transactions. While we utilize security and business controls to limit access to and use of personal information, any breach of student or employee privacy or errors in storing, using or transmitting personal information could violate privacy laws and regulations resulting in fines or other penalties. A wide range of high profile data breaches in recent years has led to renewed interest in federal data and cybersecurity legislation that could increase our costs and/or require changes in our operating procedures or systems. A breach, theft or loss of personal information held by us or our vendors, or a violation of the laws and regulations governing privacy could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or result in lawsuits, additional regulation, remediation and compliance costs or investments in additional security systems to protect our computer networks, the costs of which may be substantial.\nIndex\nOur credit agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on the Company, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities, and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions.\nOn November 14, 2019, the Company executed a new credit agreement with its lender relating to our $60 million credit facility. See Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent Transactions.\u201d The credit agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions. These restrictions, which are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, could limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\nundertake capital expenditures;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u2022\npay dividends and distributions or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments, loans and advances; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates.\nIn addition, the credit agreement requires us to maintain a minimum tangle net worth, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum of $5 million in quarterly average aggregate balances on deposit with the lender which if not maintained will result in the assessment of a quarterly fee of $12,500. See Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nThese covenants could materially adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs. Furthermore, they may restrict our ability to expand and pursue our business strategies and otherwise conduct our business. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by circumstances and events beyond our control, such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with such covenants. These restrictions could also limit our ability to obtain future financings to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategies and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants and other terms of the credit agreement could result in an event of default. If any such event of default occurs and is not waived, the lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, under the credit facility to be immediately due and payable, and could foreclose on the assets securing the credit facility. The lender would also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further credit extensions. If we are forced to refinance any borrowings under the credit facility on less favorable terms or if we cannot refinance these borrowings, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, although the credit agreement contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in compliance with these restrictions in the future. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. Our obligations under our credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and any assets that we or our subsidiaries may acquire in the future. As of December 31, 2019, we had $34.8 million outstanding under the 2019 Credit Agreement for which we hedged 57% of the amount outstanding by entering into a cash flow hedge with a fixed interest rate of 5.36%. In the future, we may again enter into interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nIndex\nIn addition, the interest rates under our credit agreement are calculated using the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced its intention to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 and it is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established. If LIBOR ceases to exist after 2021, a comparable or successor reference rate as approved by the lender under our credit agreement will apply under the credit agreement. The U.S. Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York formed a committee, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the \u201cARRC\u201d), comprised of private-sector entities with a presence in markets affected by LIBOR and public-sector entities, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, banking regulators and other financial sector regulators, to recommend an alternative rate to U.S. dollar LIBOR. The ARRC has identified an index, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), as its preferred alternative rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. Some market participants are also considering other U.S. dollar reference rates for certain instruments. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of a dominant successor to LIBOR or a variety of alternative reference rates in the United States or elsewhere. To the extent these interest rates increase, our interest expense will increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nChanges in U.S. tax laws or adverse outcomes from examination of our tax returns could have an adverse effect upon our financial results.\nWe are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the United States. Legislation or other changes in the tax laws of the jurisdictions where we do business could increase our liability and adversely affect our after-tax profitability. In addition, we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and the taxing authorities of various states. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and we have accrued tax and related interest for potential adjustments to tax liabilities for prior years. However, there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these tax examinations will not have a material effect, either positive or negative, on our business, financial conditions and results of operation.\nPublic health epidemics or outbreaks could adversely impact our business.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. While initially concentrated in China, the outbreak has now spread to other countries and infections have been reported globally including in the United States. The extent to which the coronavirus, like any other rapidly spreading contagious illness, may impact our operations will depend on the evolution of the outbreak, which is highly speculative at this time and cannot be predicted with any level of confidence. The duration of the outbreak, new information which emerges concerning the severity of the illness and the actions to be taken to contain the spread of the virus or its treatment remains unclear. We believe that the continued spread of the coronavirus could adversely impact our operations. A quarantine of one or more of our instructors for two or more weeks due to exposure to the coronavirus or other contagious illness could eliminate a program unless a substitute was readily available and quarantine of an instructor or student could cause the temporary closure of an affected school which could have an adverse impact on our business and our financial results. Further, the spread of a contagious illness or fear of such an event could have a material adverse effect on enrollment at least in the short-term.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE\nThe current holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, Juniper Investment Company Inc. and Talanta Investment Group, Inc., with their affiliates, beneficially own approximately 18% and 9%, respectively, of our outstanding common stock on an \u201cas converted basis.\u201d As such, each holder of Series A Preferred Stock possesses significant voting power over the common stock, and there can be no assurance that their interests will align with the interests of the other common shareholders.\nIn November 2019, we issued shares of Series A Preferred Stock (see Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent Transactions\u201d below) to two investors that requires us to obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock to authorize numerous actions, including to pay dividends on our common stock, repurchase our common stock, issue certain new classes of preferred stock, and incur indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such approval should we seek to take an action requiring their approval.\nIn addition to the blocking rights noted above, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock vote with the holders of shares of common stock and not as a separate class, at any annual or special meeting of shareholders of our Company, and may act by written consent in the same manner as the holders of common stock, on an as-converted basis, but in all cases each holder of Series A Preferred Stock together with its affiliates, may not vote more than 19.99% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding after giving effect to the shares being voted by the holder (the \u201cHard Cap\u201d), unless prior shareholder approval is obtained or no longer required by the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market. The current holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, Juniper Investment Company Inc. and Talanta Investment Group, Inc., with their affiliates, beneficially own approximately 18% and 9%, respectively, of our outstanding common stock on an \u201cas converted basis.\u201d As such, each holder of Series A Preferred Stock possesses significant voting power over the common stock, and there can be no assurance that their interests will align with the interests of the other common shareholders.\nIn addition to possessing significant common stock voting power on any matter put to a vote of the common shareholders, which includes the appointment of directors, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, have the right to appoint one director to the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cSeries A Director\u201d) who may serve on any committees of the Board, until the later of (i) the time that the shares of Series A Preferred Stock have been converted into common stock or (ii) the time that a holder still owns shares of Series A Preferred Stock that are subject to conversion and the sum of such shares plus any other shares of common stock represent at least 10% of the total outstanding shares of common stock. John A. Bartholdson currently serves as the Series A Director.\nIndex\nWe have an obligation to pay dividends on our shares of Series A Preferred Stock.\nDividends on the Series A Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries A Dividends\u201d), at the initial annual rate of 9.6% are to be paid, in advance, from the date of issuance quarterly on each December 31, March 31, June 30 and September 30 with September 30, 2020 as the first dividend payment date. The Company, at its option, may pay dividends in cash or by increasing the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock (the \u201cConversion Shares\u201d). The value of any dividend paid in Conversion Shares will increase the dollar amount subject to the dividend rate and thereby increase subsequent dividend amounts. We anticipate satisfying our dividend obligation by increase in the Conversion Shares for the foreseeable future. As a result, it is likely that the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock will increase their ownership percentage in our Company and thereby lower the ownership percentage of our common shareholders. In addition, by not paying cash dividends, we will be increasing the dollar amount of future dividends.\nThe dividend rate is subject to increase (a) by 2.4% per annum on the fifth anniversary of the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock and (b) by 2% per annum but in no event above 14% per annum should the Company fail to perform certain obligations owed to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock. In order to pay Series A Dividends in cash, we require the approval of our lender under our credit agreement and there can be no assurance that even were we able to pay Series A Dividends in cash, we would be able to secure the necessary lender approvals to do so.\nWhile we have not paid dividends to our common shareholders since February 2015 and we do not foresee doing so in the future, in addition to obtaining the approval of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, of which there can be no assurance, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are required to participate in any such cash dividend on an \u201cas converted basis\u201d thereby diluting any such dividend payment to the common shareholders.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock is perpetual.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock is perpetual having no fixed maturity date. However, on and after November 14, 2024, the Company may redeem all or any of the Series A Preferred Stock for a cash price (the \u201cLiquidation Preference\u201d) equal to the greater of (i) the sum of $1,000 (subject to adjustment) plus the dollar amount of any declared Series A Dividends not paid in cash and (ii) the value of the Conversion Shares were such shares of Series A Preferred Stock converted. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds or available financing sources to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock, or if we had the necessary funding we would be able to obtain the consent of our then lender to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock. It is therefore possible that the Series A Preferred Stock will be outstanding for an indefinite period of time.\nWe may not be able to force the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nEach share of Series A Preferred Stock, at any time, is convertible into a number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient of (i) the sum of (A) $1,000 (subject to adjustment) plus (B) the dollar amount of any declared Series A Dividends not paid in cash divided by (ii) the Series A Conversion Price as of the applicable Conversion Date, but subject to the Hard Cap. The initial Conversion Price is $2.36 (the \u201cConvertible Formula\u201d).\nIf, at any time following November 14, 2022, the volume weighted average price of the Company\u2019s common stock for a period of 20 consecutive trading days and on each such trading day at least 20,000 shares of common stock was traded, equals or exceeds $5.31 per share (2.25 times the Conversion Price) the Company may, at its option and subject to the Hard Cap, require that any or all of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock be automatically converted into shares of common stock at the then applicable Convertible Formula. To the extent that we satisfy our Series A Dividend obligation by increasing the number of common shares issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, that would further dilute our common stock and likely result in downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that our common stock will trade at the per share price, for the necessary period of time and with the required volume to cause the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock into common stock, at any time or at all.\nRegistration of the Conversion Shares may cause overhang.\nThe holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to unlimited registration rights for the Conversion Shares, including 2 of which that may require us to effectuate an underwritten offering. Although unless our stock price significantly increases, it is likely that the Series A Holders will hold their Series A Preferred Stock and not convert them into shares of common stock, we are obligated to file with the SEC by November 13, 2020 a registration statement for the shelf covering the Conversion Shares (the \u201cResale Shelf\u201d) and use our commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Resale Shelf to be declared effective by the SEC not later than 60 days after the filing thereof. The filing of the Resale Shelf covering the Conversion Shares may create market overhang on our common stock and thereby downward pressure on the price of our common stock. Should we be unable to cause the Resale Shelf (and certain other registration statements concerning the Conversion Shares) to be declared effective by the SEC timely, or certain other events occur with respect to such registration statements, some of which are beyond our control, we are required to pay the holders of Series A Preferred Stock an amount equal to 1.5% of the value of the Conversion Shares covered thereby for each 30 day period that such registration statements are not declared effective, up to a maximum of 7.5%.\nIndex\nShareholders of Series A Preferred Stock may transfer their shares after November 13, 2020 without our approval.\nThe holders of Series A Preferred Stock may, subject to compliance with the securities laws, sell their Series A Preferred Stock to any purchaser, without our prior approval. While we believe we have a good relationship with the current holders of Series A Preferred Stock, there can be no assurance that we will continue to enjoy good relations with them or with any purchaser of their Series A Preferred Stock.\nIn the event of certain changes of control, holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive a liquidation\npreference.\nIn the event of certain changes of control, some of which are not within the Company\u2019s control (as defined in the Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation as a \u201cFundamental Change\u201d or a \u201cLiquidation\u201d), the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive the Liquidation Preference, unless such Fundamental Change is a stock merger in which certain value and volume requirements are met, in which case the Series A Preferred Stock will be converted into common stock in connection with such stock merger. As a result, this provision (along with the other provisions of the Series A Preferred Stock) may make the Company less attractive to a potential acquirer.\nOur principal shareholder owns a significant percentage of our capital stock and is able to influence certain corporate matters.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Juniper Investment Company, LLC and its affiliates (\u201cJuniper\u201d) beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 18% of our outstanding common stock and 88% of our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, which votes on an as-converted basis subject to a voting cap, as described below. The voting power of Juniper, including the common stock and the as-converted preferred stock with the voting cap described below, was approximately 19.9% as of December 31, 2019.\nEach share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible, at any time, into a number of shares of common stock equal to (\u201cConvertible Formula\u201d) the quotient of (i) the sum of (A) $1,000 (subject to adjustment as provided in the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation, as amended) plus (B) the dollar amount of any dividends applicable to the Series A Preferred Stock and not paid in cash divided by (ii) the Series A Conversion Price (as defined and adjusted in the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation) as of the applicable date of conversion. The initial conversion price is $2.36. At all times, however, the number of shares of common stock that can be issued to any holder of Series A Preferred Stock may not result in such holder and its affiliates owning more than 19.99% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding after giving effect to the conversion (the \u201cHard Cap\u201d), unless prior shareholder approval is obtained or no longer required by the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market. If, at any time following November 14, 2022 the volume weighted average price of the Company\u2019s common stock equals or exceeds 2.25 times the conversion price for a period of 20 consecutive trading days and on each such trading day at least 20,000 shares of common stock was traded, the Company may, at its option and subject to the Hard Cap, require that any or all of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock be automatically converted into shares of common stock at the then applicable Convertible Formula.\nThe holders of Series A Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, have the right to appoint one director to the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cSeries A Director\u201d) who may serve on any committees of the Board, until such time as the later of (i) the shares of Series A Preferred Stock have been converted into common stock or (ii) a holder still owns shares of Series A Preferred Stock that are subject to conversion and the sum of such shares plus any other shares of common stock represent at least 10% of the total outstanding shares of common stock.\nHolders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote with the holders of shares of common stock and any other class or series similarly entitled to vote with the holders of common stock and not as a separate class, at any annual or special meeting of shareholders of our Company, and may act by written consent in the same manner as the holders of common stock, on an as-converted basis, in all cases subject to the Hard Cap. In addition, a majority of the voting power of the Series A Preferred Stock must approve certain significant actions of the Company, including (i) declaring a dividend or otherwise redeeming or repurchasing any shares of common stock and other junior securities, if any, subject to certain exceptions, (ii) incurring indebtedness, except for certain permitted indebtedness and (iii) creating a subsidiary other than a wholly-owned subsidiary.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and New Jersey law could\ndiscourage a change of control that our shareholders may favor, which could negatively affect our stock price.\nIn addition to the Series A Preferred Stock, provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws and applicable provisions of the New Jersey Business Corporation Act may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of the Company even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our shareholders. These provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. For example, applicable provisions of the New Jersey Business Corporation Act may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of five years after the person becomes an interested shareholder. Furthermore, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\nIndex\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart \u2022 a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of stock to elect some directors;\n\u2022\nrequire super-majority voting to effect amendments to certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation;\n\u2022\nlimit who may call special meetings of both the board of directors and shareholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit shareholder action by non-unanimous written consent and otherwise require all shareholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at shareholders\u2019 meetings; and\n\u2022\nrequire that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly created directorships, be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office.\nWe can issue shares of preferred stock without general shareholder approval (thought approval of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock would be necessary), which could adversely affect the rights of common shareholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation permits us to establish the rights, privileges, preferences and restrictions, including voting rights, of future series of our preferred stock and to issue such stock without approval from our shareholders. The rights of holders of our common stock may suffer as a result of the rights granted to holders of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. In addition, we could issue preferred stock to prevent a change in control of our Company, depriving common shareholders of an opportunity to sell their stock at a price in excess of the prevailing market price.\nThe trading price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future.\nOur stock price has declined substantially over the past five years and has and may fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of factors, some of which are not in our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic \u2022 conditions;\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in the for-profit, post-secondary education industry;\n\u2022\nnegative media coverage of the for-profit, post-secondary education industry;\n\u2022\nfailure of certain of our schools or programs to maintain compliance under the gainful employment regulation, 90-10 Rule or with financial responsibility standards;\n\u2022\nthe impact of DOE rulemaking and other changes in the highly regulated environment in which we operate;\n\u2022\nthe initiation, pendency or outcome of litigation, accreditation reviews and regulatory reviews, inquiries and investigations;\n\u2022\nloss of key personnel;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nour ability to meet or exceed, or changes in, expectations of investors and analysts, or the extent of analyst coverage of us; and decisions by any significant investors to reduce their investment in our common stock.\nIn addition, the trading volume of our common stock is relatively low. This may cause our stock price to react more to these factors and various other factors and may impact an investor\u2019s ability to sell our common stock at the desired time at a price considered satisfactory. Any of these factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance, and could prevent an investor from selling shares of our common stock at or above the price at which the investor purchased them.", "PERMNO": 90735, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "LINC"}
