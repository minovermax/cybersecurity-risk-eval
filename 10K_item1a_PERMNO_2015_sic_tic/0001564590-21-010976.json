{"cik": "1705843", "company": "Calyxt, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nThis section includes a discussion of what we believe to be the most significant important factors that could affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and the trading price of our common stock. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may occur or become material in the future. You should carefully consider these risk factors in connection with Part 2, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations,\u201d the consolidated financials and the other information in this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and prospects and may increase the risk of investment.\nWe are an early-stage biotechnology company with a limited operating history that to date has been focused primarily on R&D. Investment in plant-based technology product development is a highly speculative endeavor. It entails substantial upfront R&D investment, primarily in the areas of field trials to support regulatory filings and pre-launch breeding, and there is significant risk that we will not be able to edit the genes in a particular plant to express a desired trait. Moreover, the regulatory pathway for our product candidates can be uncertain and could add significant additional cost and time to development.\nOur limited operating history may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and our prospects. We have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly developing and changing industries, such as the plant-based technology industry, including challenges in forecasting accuracy, determining appropriate investments of our limited resources, gaining market acceptance of the products made using our gene editing platform, managing a complex regulatory landscape, and developing new product candidates.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the next several years.\nOur net loss was $45.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $167.2 million. The amount of our future losses will depend, in part, on our revenues and expenses associated with sales of our high oleic soybean seed, the timing of the introduction of additional products, our ability to identify and contract with collaboration partners, and revenues and expenses associated with technology licensing. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance.\nWe cannot assure you that we will generate increases in our revenues, successfully contract with third parties who will commercialize our product candidates or generate revenue from licensing or attain a level of profitable operations. Based on our history of losses, we do not expect that we will be able to fund our longer-term capital and liquidity needs through our cash balances and operating cash flow alone. To fund our longer-term capital and liquidity needs, we expect we will need to secure additional capital. Our business plan and financing needs are subject to change depending on, among other things, the success of our efforts to grow revenue and our efforts to continue to effectively manage expenses.\nWe face significant competition and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources than we do.\nThe market for plant-based technology products is highly competitive, and we face significant direct and indirect competition in several aspects of our business. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Competition\u201d. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, distribution, and other resources than we do. As a result, we may be unable to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, which may result in reductions in revenue, reduced margins, and the inability to achieve market acceptance for our products. We expect to continue to face significant competition.\nMany of our competitors engage in ongoing R&D, and technological developments by our competitors could render our products less competitive or obsolete, resulting in reduced revenues compared to our expectations. Our ability to compete effectively and to achieve commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to: develop new products with properties attractive to collaboration partners; identify and contract with third parties who will collaborate with us on the development and testing of products we develop, and contracting with those same third parties for the commercialization of those products. We may not be successful in achieving these factors and any such failure may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, certain competitors may seek to license our technology. We have, in the past, entered such licensing arrangements and may enter such arrangements in the future. Some of these companies may have significantly greater financial resources and may even compete with our business. In such circumstances, competitors could use our technologies to develop their own products that would compete with products commercialized by our collaboration partners.\nWe also anticipate increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market and new technologies become available. Our technology may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors that are more effective or that enable them to develop and commercialize products more quickly or with lower expense than we are able to. At the same time, the expiration of patents covering existing technologies reduces the barriers to entry for competitors. If for any reason our technology becomes obsolete or uneconomical relative to our competitors\u2019 technologies, this would prevent or limit our ability to generate revenues from the commercialization of our products.\nOur business activities are currently conducted at a limited number of locations, which makes us susceptible to damage or business disruptions caused by natural disasters or acts of vandalism.\nOur current headquarters and R&D facilities, which include an office, labs, greenhouses, and field-testing plots are in Roseville, Minnesota. Our seed production takes place primarily in the United States and its territories with contra season production also occurring in Argentina. Third party warehousing for seed storage, and our limited number of processing partners (e.g., storage and transportation) are all currently located in the Upper Midwest region of the United States. We take precautions to safeguard our facilities, including insurance, health and safety protocols, and off-site storage of critical research results and computer data. Particularly in the case of insurance, our insurance may not cover certain losses, or our losses may exceed our coverage limits. A natural disaster, such as a hurricane, drought, fire, flood, tornado, earthquake, or other intentional or negligent acts, including acts of vandalism, could damage or destroy our equipment, inventory, development projects, field trials or data, and cause us to incur significant additional expenses to repair or replace the damaged physical facilities, which in the case of seed production may be the result of years of development work that is not easily or quickly reproduced, and increase the development schedule for our pipeline of product candidates.\nTo compete effectively, we must introduce new products that achieve market acceptance.\nTo remain competitive and increase revenue, we must identify and offer novel traits that appeal to potential collaboration partners or identify and contract with third parties for the development and introduction of new product candidates. If we fail to anticipate or respond to technological developments, market requirements, or fail to meet market demand, our revenues will not increase.\nDevelopment of successful products using plant gene editing requires significant levels of investment in R&D, including laboratory, greenhouse, and field testing, to demonstrate product effectiveness and can take several years or more. We incurred R&D expenses, including non-cash stock compensation expenses, of $11.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, $12.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, and $10.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. We must commit significant resources and may incur obligations (such as royalty obligations or milestone fees) to develop new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept and without knowing the levels of revenue, if any, that may be derived from these products.\nDevelopment of new or improved plant-based products involves risks of failure inherent in the development of products based on innovative and complex technologies. Accordingly, if we or our collaboration partners experience any significant delays in the development or introduction of new products or if our new products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nAny collaboration arrangements that we may enter in the future may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nWe are seeking collaboration arrangements with third parties for the development and commercialization of our product candidates. We will face significant competition in seeking appropriate partners. Moreover, collaboration arrangements are complex and time-consuming to negotiate, document, implement and maintain. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement collaboration arrangements. The terms of any collaborations that we may establish may not be favorable to us.\nThe success of our collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our partners. Collaborations are subject to numerous risks, which may include that:\n\u2022\npartners have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources applied to R&D partnerships and may not commit sufficient resources to successfully advance a product candidate or achieve commercial success;\n\u2022\npartners could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with ours;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise that cause the delay or termination of the research, development, or commercialization of our current or future products or that results in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; and\n\u2022\na partner\u2019s sales and marketing activities or other operations may not follow applicable laws resulting in civil or criminal proceedings.\nIf our field trials are unsuccessful, we may be unable to complete the development of product candidates on a timely basis or at all.\nWe rely on field trials to demonstrate the efficacy of product candidates that we develop and evaluate in greenhouse conditions. Field trials allow us to test product candidates in the field as well as to increase seed production, and to measure performance across multiple geographies and conditions. Successful completion of field trials is critical to the success of our product development efforts. If our ongoing or future field trials are unsuccessful or produce inconsistent results or unanticipated adverse effects on the agronomic performance of our crops, or if the field trials do not produce reliable data, our product development efforts could be delayed, subject to additional regulatory review or abandoned entirely. In addition, to support our commercialization efforts, it is necessary to collect data across multiple growing seasons and from different geographies. Even in cases where initial field trials are successful, we cannot be certain that additional field trials conducted on a greater number of acres or in different geographies will also be successful. Many factors that are beyond our control may adversely affect the success of these field trials, including unique geographic conditions, weather and climatic variations, disease, or pests, or acts of protest or vandalism. Field trials, which may take up to two to three years, are costly, and any field trial failures that we may experience may not be covered by insurance and, therefore, could result in increased costs, which may negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we were notified that a significant portion of our high fiber wheat plants were lost in field trials due to improper aerial chemical applications by unaffiliated third parties. As a result of the crop destruction, the number of cultivars was reduced, which represents a significant reduction in the genetic potential of the wheat germplasm that carries the high fiber trait. The damage has resulted in launch size and regulatory timelines being adversely affected. We are pursuing available avenues of recourse against the unaffiliated third parties involved in the initial crop loss as well as the adverse impact upon the surviving germplasm lines.\nThe successful commercialization of our seed products depends on our production of high-quality seeds cost-effectively at scale and to accurately forecast demand for our products, and we may be unable to do so.\nThe production of commercial-scale quantities of seeds requires the multiplication of seeds through a succession of plantings and seed harvests. The cost-effective production of high-quality, high-volume quantities of any product candidates depends on our ability to scale our production processes to produce seeds in enough quantity to meet demand. We cannot assure that our existing or future seed production techniques will enable us to meet our large-scale production goals cost-effectively. Even if we are successful in developing ways to increase yields and enhance quality, we may not be able to do so cost-effectively or on a timely basis, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve profitability. If we are unable to maintain or enhance the quality of our seeds as we increase our production capacity, including through the expected use of third parties, we may experience reductions in customer demand, higher costs, and increased inventory write-offs.\nSeed production delays could adversely affect our ability to deliver seed to our customers to meet farmer planting windows. Our dependency upon timely seed deliveries means that interruptions or stoppages in such deliveries, or delays or limitations with respect to seed production, could adversely affect our operations until alternative arrangements could be made. Such a delay would adversely affect our reputation and revenues. If we were unable to produce the necessary seed for an extended period for any reason, our business, customer relations, and operating results could suffer.\nIn addition, because of the length of time it takes to produce commercial quantities of marketable seeds, we will need to make seed production decisions well in advance of their sale. Our ability to accurately forecast supply can be adversely affected by several factors outside of our control, including changes in market conditions, environmental factors, such as pests and diseases, and adverse weather conditions. A shortfall in the supply of our seed may reduce revenue, damage our reputation in the market, adversely affect relationships, and could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our customers may cancel orders, request a decrease in quantity, or make returns, which may lead to a surplus of our products. Any seed surplus we have on hand may negatively impact cash flows, reduce the quality of our inventory, and ultimately result in write-offs of that inventory.\nWhile we estimate that the potential size of our target markets for our products is significant, that estimate has not been independently verified and is based on certain assumptions that may not prove to be accurate. Our ability to accurately forecast demand is dependent on the timing of customer decisions, qualification cycles, and other factors outside of our control. As a result, these estimates could differ materially from actual market sizes, which could result in decreased demand for our products and therefore adversely impact our future business prospects, results of operation and financial condition.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct field trials, perform research services, and produce seed for product candidates, and any performance issues by third parties, or our inability to engage third parties on acceptable terms, may impact our ability to successfully commercialize such product candidates.\nWe currently rely on third parties, such as growers, consultants, contractors, universities, and contract seed producers to conduct, monitor, support and oversee certain research and development activities, including field trials, and produce seed for us. In some cases, these activities are conducted outside of the United States, making it difficult for us to monitor the work being conducted by the third parties that we engage. Although we provide our third-party contractors with protocols regarding the production and handing of our product candidates, we have limited control over the execution of their activities. Poor execution or data collection, failure to follow required agronomic practices, protocols, or regulatory requirements, or mishandling of product candidates by these third parties could impair success. Any such failures may result in delays in the development of our product candidates or the incurrence of additional costs. Even if our third-party contractors adhere to our suggested protocols, field trials or seed production may fail to succeed for a variety of other reasons, including weather, disease or pests, improper timing of planting our seeds, or incorrect fertilizer use. Ultimately, we remain responsible for ensuring work performed is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and standards, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our responsibilities. Should such third parties fail to comply with these standards, our ability to develop our product candidates could be adversely impacted.\nAdditionally, if we are unable to maintain or enter into agreements with third-party contractors on acceptable terms, or if engagement is terminated prematurely, we may be unable to conduct or complete our field trials or seed production in the manner we anticipate. If our relationship with any of these third parties is terminated, we may be unable to enter arrangements with alternative contractors on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Switching or adding third-party contractors can involve substantial cost and require extensive management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when any new third party commences work. As a result, delays may occur, which could materially impact our ability to meet our desired development timelines, our operations, and our profitability.\nThe unintended presence of our traits in other products or plants may negatively affect us.\nTrace amounts of our traits may unintentionally be found in the products of third parties, which may result in negative publicity and claims of liability brought by such third parties or others against us. Furthermore, in the event of an unintended dissemination of our gene edited germplasm into the environment, or the presence of unintended trace amounts of our traits in conventional seed, or in the grain or products produced from conventional crops, we could be subject to claims by multiple parties, including environmental advocacy groups, as well as governmental actions such as mandated crop destruction, product recalls, or additional stewardship practices and environmental cleanup or monitoring.\nThe successful commercialization of our products may face challenges from public perceptions of gene edited products and ethical, legal, environmental, health and social concerns.\nThe successful commercialization of our product candidates depends, in part, on public acceptance of gene edited plant products.\nConsumers may not understand the nature of our technologies, which may make consumers more susceptible to the influence of negative information provided by opponents of biotechnology. Other groups oppose biotechnology particularly as utilized in the food system and direct efforts to disrupt the forward progression of such biotechnology, both generally and with respect to specific applications. Some opponents of biotechnology actively seek to raise public concern about gene editing, whether transgenic or non-transgenic, by claiming that plant products developed using biotechnology are unsafe for consumption or their use, pose a risk of damage to the environment, or creates legal, social, and ethical dilemmas. The commercial success of our products and product candidates may be adversely affected by such claims, even if unsubstantiated.\nIn addition, opponents of biotechnology have vandalized the fields of farmers planting biotech seeds and facilities used by biotechnology companies. Any such acts of vandalism targeting the fields of farmers planting crops with our traits, our field-testing sites or our research, production, or other facilities, could adversely affect our sales and our costs.\nNegative public perceptions about gene editing can also affect the regulatory environment in the jurisdictions in which we are targeting the sale of our products and the commercialization of our product candidates. Any increase in such negative perceptions or any restrictive government regulations in response thereto, could have a negative effect on our business and may delay or impair the sale of our products or the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Public pressure may lead to increased regulation of products produced using biotechnology, further legislation regarding novel trait development technologies, or administrative litigation concerning prior regulatory determinations, each of which could adversely affect our ability to sell our product or commercialize our product candidates. In addition, labeling requirements could heighten public concerns and make consumers less likely to purchase food products\ncontaining gene edited ingredients.\nAdditionally, we are currently exploring product and partnership opportunities in hemp, among other crops. Hemp, as defined in the 2018 Farm Bill as Cannabis sativa containing a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis, has been removed from the Controlled Substances Act and is legally distinct from marijuana/cannabis, which is Cannabis sativa containing a THC concentration of more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis. Because the hemp plant and the marijuana plant are both part of the same cannabis sativa species of plant, our activities with legal hemp may be incorrectly perceived as us being involved in federally illegal marijuana. Also, despite growing support for the cannabis industry and legalization of cannabis in certain states in the United States, many individuals and businesses remain opposed to the cannabis industry. Any negative press resulting from any incorrect perception that we have entered the cannabis space could result in a loss of current or future business. It could also adversely affect the public\u2019s perception of us and lead to reluctance by new parties to do business with us or to own our common stock. Business partners, including but not limited to financial institutions and customers, may attempt to end, or limit their relationships with us due to this incorrect perception, which may negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nProducts that we develop, and food containing our products, may fail to meet standards established by third-party non-GMO verification organizations, which could reduce the value of our products to customers.\nCertain third-party organizations offer verification programs that seek to identify non-GMO products to consumers. These organizations verify the status of products (such as foods, beverages, and vitamins) as non-GMO based on independently developed standards, and often authorize the display of specific markers or labels illustrating such status on the verified product\u2019s packaging. Standards established by such third-party organizations for the verification of non-GMO status may differ from applicable regulatory legal standards applied by regulators in the United States. As a result, notwithstanding a determination as to the non-regulated status of a product pursuant to APHIS\u2019s regulatory procedures (or a similar determination in other jurisdictions), our products, and third-party products that utilize our gene edited products as ingredients, may fail to meet more restrictive or non-scientific standards imposed by these independent verification organizations.\nFor example, there are third-party verification organizations that withhold non-GMO certification from products developed using gene editing technology, including a product that does not contain any foreign DNA, such as our current product candidates. Such a position means that some non-GMO seals or labels are not available for gene edited products.\nIf we are sued for defective products and if such lawsuits were determined adversely, we could be subject to substantial damages, for which insurance coverage is not available.\nWe may be held liable if any product we develop, or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies, is found unsuitable during marketing, sale, or consumption. For example, the detection of an unintended trait in a commercial seed variety or the crops and products produced may result in governmental actions such as mandated crop destruction, product recalls or environmental cleanup or monitoring. Concerns about seed quality could also lead to additional regulations being imposed on our business, such as regulations related to testing procedures, mandatory governmental reviews of biotechnology advances, or additional regulations relating to the integrity of the food supply chain from the farm to the finished product.\nWe may need to raise additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts or other operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments of $30.0 million. We believe our cash and cash equivalents will be enough to fund our operations into the second half of 2022.\nOur business plan is to advance our soybean product to a seed go-to-market strategy, collaborate with third parties to complete the development and regulatory processes for our other product candidates, including new product candidates we agree to develop for third parties, and strategically license our technology. Based on our history of losses, we do not expect that we will be able to fund our longer-term capital and liquidity needs to execute our business plan and pursue our strategic goals through our cash balances and operating cash flow alone. To fund our longer-term capital and liquidity needs, we expect we will need to secure additional capital. Our business plan and financing needs are subject to change depending on, among other things, success of our product development efforts, our revenue, and our efforts to continue to effectively manage expenses. If we are ultimately unable to generate sufficient revenue to meet our financial targets, become profitable and have sustainable positive cash flows, we may be required to further reduce expenses, which could have a further negative effect on our ability to generate revenue, or we may be required to raise additional capital more quickly than we expect or we may need more capital than we expect.\nWe may obtain future additional financing by incurring indebtedness or from an offering of our equity or convertible securities or both. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of additional equity or convertible securities, current ownership interests will be diluted, and new investors may demand rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock. Debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and a portion of our operating cash flows, if any, being dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness. In addition, debt financing may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that impose operating restrictions, such as restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, the making of certain capital expenditures or the declaration of dividends. If we raise capital in the future, we cannot assure you that additional capital will be available in the amount or at the time we need it, or that it will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay, or discontinue one or more of our research or product candidate development programs or the commercialization of any product candidate or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could materially affect our business, operating results and prospects and cause the price of the common stock to decline.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting deterioration of worldwide economic conditions adversely impact our business, financial condition, and operating results will depend on future developments, which are difficult to predict.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement numerous and rapidly evolving measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limits on gatherings, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business shutdowns. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and in accordance with governmental orders, we have also modified our business practices and implemented proactive measures to protect the health and safety of employees, including restricting employee travel, requiring remote work arrangements for non-laboratory employees, implementing social distancing, and enhanced sanitary measures in our headquarters, and cancelling attendance at events and conferences. Many of the suppliers, vendors, and service providers on whom we rely on have made similar modifications. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by, or the impacts and disruptions of, the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and government actions to contain it, related volatility in the financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions, we could experience material adverse operational and financial impacts, including:\n\u2022\noverall lower expenditures by potential commercial partners as a result of challenging economic circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and potentially continuing after the immediate crisis subsides;\n\u2022\ndisruptions and delays to our R&D pipeline resulting from a shutdown of our headquarters due to expanded governmental restrictions or illness among our personnel as a result of COVID-19, increased absenteeism among employees, or delays with respect to raw materials necessary for our R&D activities;\n\u2022\ninterruptions or delays in seed production or grain sales resulting from supply chain disruptions, including as a result of restrictions or disruptions to transportation or operational disruptions at warehousing, storage, crushing and/or refining facilities;\n\u2022\noverall reduced operational productivity resulting from challenges associated with remote work arrangements, limited resources available to our employees (particularly with respect to our business development employees for whom in-person access to our customers and customer prospects has been significantly limited) and increased cybersecurity risks as a result of remote access to our information systems; and\n\u2022\nconstraints on financing opportunities resulting from dislocations in the capital markets, which may make it too costly or difficult for us to pursue public or private equity or debt financings on acceptable terms.\nThe degree to which COVID-19 impacts our business and results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the severity, duration and geographic spread of the outbreak, and the global, national, and regional actions to contain the virus and address its impact, including travel restrictions imposed, business closures or business disruption.\nThe resumption of normal business operations after interruptions caused by COVID-19 may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of COVID-19 on us or our suppliers, third-party service providers, counterparties in collaboration arrangement or licenses, or customers. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, Calyxt may experience material and adverse impacts on its business, operating results, and financial condition as a result of the global economic impact of COVID-19 outbreak, including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nThe impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, any of which could have a material effect on us. This situation is changing rapidly, and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe overall agricultural industry is susceptible to commodity price changes and we are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices.\nChanges in the prices of commodities products could result in higher overall cost along the agricultural supply chain, which may negatively affect our ability to commercialize our products. We will be susceptible to changes in costs in the agricultural industry as a result of factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, seasonal fluctuations, weather conditions, demand, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulations. As a result, we may not be able to anticipate or react to changing costs by adjusting our practices, which could cause our operating results to deteriorate. While we manage our exposure to changing commodity prices underlying sales contracts and supply agreements for grain and seed production by entering into commodity derivative transactions, those activities may not provide full mitigation of our exposure to changes in commodity prices, and as a result our results of operations and financial condition may be affected. See Item 7A \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d.\nAdverse weather conditions, natural disasters, crop disease, pests and other natural conditions can impose significant costs and losses on our business.\nOur and a farmer\u2019s ability to grow our products is vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, including windstorms, floods, drought, and temperature extremes, which are quite common but difficult to predict, the effects of which may be influenced and intensified by ongoing global climate change. Unfavorable growing conditions can reduce both crop size and crop quality. This risk is particularly acute with respect to the Upper Midwest region of the United States in which we currently source our high oleic soybean grain. In extreme cases, entire harvests may be lost in some geographic areas. Such adverse conditions can result in harvesting delays or loss of crops for farmers and cause us to be delayed, or to fail entirely in delivering product to customers, resulting in loss of revenue. Furthermore, significant fluctuations in market prices for agricultural inputs and crops could also have an adverse effect on the prices of our products.\nThe ability to grow our products is also vulnerable to crop disease and to pests, which may vary in severity and effect, depending on the stage of production at the time of infection or infestation, the type of treatment applied, climatic conditions and the risks associated with ongoing global climate change. The costs to control disease and other infestations vary depending on the severity of the damage and the extent of the plantings affected. Moreover, there can be no assurance that available technologies to control such infestations will continue to be effective. These infestations can also increase costs, decrease revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Legal Matters\nThe regulatory environment in the United States for our current and future products is uncertain and evolving.\nWe incur significant expense related to our monitoring of, and compliance with, applicable regulatory requirements in the United States. Changes in applicable regulatory requirements could result in a substantial increase in the time and costs associated with developing our products and negatively impact our operating results. While the USDA and FDA currently have petition processes that we have successfully completed in the past, these processes, and the manner in which the USDA and FDA interpret their own regulations may change in the future, negatively impacting our speed to market and cost to launch product candidates. We cannot predict whether advocacy groups will challenge existing regulations and USDA or FDA determinations or whether the USDA or FDA will alter the manner in which it interprets its own regulations or institutes new regulations, or otherwise modifies regulations in a way that will subject our products to more burdensome standards, thereby substantially increasing the time and costs associated with developing our product candidates.\nAdditionally, we are currently exploring product and partnership opportunities in hemp, among other crops. Hemp is legally distinct from marijuana and recognized as an agricultural crop by the United States government. Federal and state laws and regulations on hemp address production, monitoring, manufacturing, distribution, and laboratory testing to ensure that that the hemp has a THC concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis. Federal laws and regulations may also address the transportation or shipment of hemp or hemp products. As we continue to explore hemp as a product candidate, we may become subject to increasing regulation particular to hemp, which could require us to incur additional costs associated with compliance requirements.\nThe regulatory environment outside the United States varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and there is less certainty how our products will be regulated.\nThe regulatory environment around gene editing in plants for agricultural products is greatly uncertain outside of the United States and varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Each jurisdiction may have its own regulatory framework regarding genetically modified agricultural products, which may include restrictions and regulations on planting and growing genetically modified plants and in the consumption and labeling of genetically modified foods, and which may encapsulate our products. To the extent regulatory frameworks\noutside of the United States are not receptive to our gene editing technologies, this may limit our ability to expand into other global markets.\nComplying with the regulatory requirements outside the United States will be costly and time-consuming, and there is no guarantee we will be able to commercialize our products outside the United States.\nWe cannot predict whether or when any jurisdiction will change its regulations with respect to our products. Advocacy groups have engaged in publicity campaigns and filed lawsuits in various countries against companies and regulatory authorities, seeking to halt regulatory approval or clearance activities or influence public opinion against genetically engineered and/or gene edited products. In addition, governmental reaction to negative publicity concerning our products could result in greater regulation of genetic research and derivative products or regulatory costs that render our products cost prohibitive.\nThe scale of the commodity food and agricultural industry may make it difficult to monitor and control the distribution of our products. As a result, our products may be sold inadvertently within jurisdictions where they are not approved for distribution. Such sales may lead to regulatory challenges or lawsuits against us, which could result in significant expenses and management attention.\nGovernment policies and regulations, particularly those affecting the agricultural sector and related industries, could adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nAgricultural production and trade flows are subject to government policies and regulations. Governmental policies and approvals of technologies affecting the agricultural industry, such as taxes, tariffs, duties, subsidies, incentives and import and export restrictions on agricultural commodities and commodity products can influence the planting of certain crops, the location and size of crop production, and the volume and types of imports and exports. Future government policies in the United States or in other countries may discourage our customers from using our products or encourage the use of products more advantageous to our competitors, which would put us at a commercial disadvantage and could negatively impact our future revenues and results of operations.\nWe may use biological materials in our business and are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Compliance with such laws and regulations and any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, the handling, use, storage, treatment, manufacture and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, discharge of pollutants into the environment and human health and safety matters. Our R&D processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including biological materials. We may be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials, or may otherwise be required to remediate such contamination, and our liability may exceed any insurance coverage and our total assets. Compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations may be expensive and may impair our R&D efforts. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur substantial costs and liabilities, including civil or criminal fines and penalties, clean-up costs or capital expenditures for control equipment or operational changes necessary to achieve and maintain compliance. In addition, we cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended environmental, health and safety laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted and enforced. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts or result in increased expense of compliance.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe license a significant portion of our intellectual property from Cellectis, our majority stockholder, and the University of Minnesota, and principally rely upon Cellectis to prosecute and defend such intellectual property.\nOur business relies heavily on the intellectual property we license from Cellectis and the University of Minnesota. If we do not comply with our obligations under the license agreements, we may be subject to damages, which may be significant, and in some cases Cellectis and/or the University of Minnesota may have the right to terminate the license agreement. Any termination of our license agreement with Cellectis or the University of Minnesota would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nMoreover, any enforcement of the licensed intellectual property could subject it to challenge by third parties and if any such challenge is successful, such intellectual property could be narrowed in scope or held to be invalid or unenforceable, which would materially impair any competitive advantage afforded to us by such intellectual property. There can be no assurance that Cellectis or the University of Minnesota will prosecute and maintain such intellectual property in the best interests of our business or at all, and, if Cellectis or the\nUniversity of Minnesota fails to properly prosecute and maintain such intellectual property, we could lose our rights to such intellectual property, which would materially impair any competitive advantage afforded to us by such intellectual property. For more information regarding our license agreement with Cellectis or the license agreement between Cellectis and the University of Minnesota, please see \u201cBusiness-Intellectual Property.\u201d\nPatents and patent applications involve highly complex legal and factual questions, which, if determined adversely to us, could negatively impact our competitive position.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology companies and other actors in our fields of business can be highly uncertain and involve complex scientific, legal, and factual analyses. The interpretation and breadth of claims allowed in some patents covering biological compositions may be uncertain and difficult to determine and are often affected materially by the facts and circumstances that pertain to the patented compositions and the related patent claims. The issuance and scope of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated, narrowed, or circumvented. Challenges to our or our licensors\u2019 patents and patent applications, if successful, may result in the denial of our or our licensors\u2019 patent applications or the loss or reduction in their scope. In addition, defending against such challenges may be costly and involve the diversion of significant management time. Accordingly, rights under any of our or our licensors\u2019 patents may not provide us with enough protection against competitive products or processes and any loss, denial, or reduction in scope of any of such patents and patent applications may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nEven if not challenged, our or our licensors\u2019 patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our product candidates or technology or prevent others from designing their products or technology to avoid being covered by our or our licensors\u2019 patent claims. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents we own or license is threatened, it could dissuade companies from partnering with us to develop, and could threaten our ability to successfully commercialize, our product candidates.\nIf we or our licensors fail to obtain and maintain patent protection and trade secret protection of our product candidates and technology, we could lose our competitive advantage and competition we face would increase, reducing any potential revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe will not seek to protect our intellectual property rights in all jurisdictions throughout the world and we may not be able to adequately enforce our intellectual property rights even in the jurisdictions where we seek protection.\nFiling, prosecuting, and defending patents in all countries and jurisdictions throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Patent protection must be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States could be less extensive than those in the United States, assuming that rights are obtained in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions.\nCompetitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we or our licensors do not pursue and obtain patent protection. Further, competitors may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we or our licensors have patent protection, but where the ability to enforce those patent rights is not as strong as in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our intellectual property rights and such rights may not be effective or enough to prevent such competition.\nIn addition, changes in, or different interpretations of, patent laws in the United States and other countries may permit others to use our discoveries or to develop and commercialize our technology and products without providing any notice or compensation to us or may limit the scope of patent protection that we or our licensors are able to obtain. The laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States laws and those countries may lack adequate rules and procedures for defending our intellectual property rights.\nFurthermore, proceedings to enforce our licensors\u2019 and our patent rights and other intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our or our licensors\u2019 patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our or our licensors\u2019 patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us or our licensors. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded to us, if any, may not be commercially meaningful, while the damages and other remedies we may be ordered to pay such third parties may be significant. Accordingly, our licensors\u2019 and our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nThird parties may assert rights to inventions we develop or otherwise regard as our own.\nThird parties may in the future make claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our or our licensors\u2019 intellectual property. We have written agreements with R&D partners that provide for the ownership of intellectual property arising from the relationship. Some agreements provide that we must negotiate certain commercial rights at a later date and others may not include clearly address the allocation of intellectual property rights. If we cannot successfully negotiate sufficient ownership and commercial rights to the inventions that result from our use of a third-party partner\u2019s materials, or if disputes otherwise arise with respect to the intellectual property developed through the use of a partner\u2019s samples, we may be limited in our ability to capitalize on the full market potential of these inventions. In addition, we may face claims by third parties that our agreements with employees, contractors, or consultants obligating them to assign intellectual property to us are ineffective or are in conflict with prior or competing contractual obligations of assignment. Litigation may be necessary to resolve an ownership dispute, and if we are not successful, we may be precluded from using certain intellectual property and associated products and technology, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, the research resulting in certain of our in-licensed patent rights and technology was funded in part by the United States government. As a result, the United States government has certain rights to such patent rights and technology, which include march-in rights. When new technologies are developed with government funding, the government generally obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including a non-exclusive license authorizing the government to use the invention or to have others use the invention on its behalf. The government can exercise its march-in rights if it determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the government-funded technology, or because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations, or to give preference to the United States industry. Any exercise by the government of any of the foregoing rights could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAny infringement, misappropriation, or other violation by us of intellectual property rights of others may prevent or delay our product development efforts and may prevent or increase the costs of our successfully commercializing our product candidates.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to operate without infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating the intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties. We cannot assure that our business operations, products, product candidates and methods and the business operations, products, product candidates and methods of our partners do not or will not infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.\nThe biotechnology industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Other parties may allege that our products, product candidates or the use of our technologies infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate patent claims or other intellectual property rights held by them or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. Patent and other types of intellectual property litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and their outcome is uncertain. Any claim relating to intellectual property infringement that is successfully asserted against us may require us to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we or our partners are found to be willfully infringing another party\u2019s patents, for past use of the asserted intellectual property and royalties and other consideration going forward if we are forced to take a license. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property rights or technologies licensed to us. In addition, if any such claim were successfully asserted against us and we could not obtain a license, we or our partners may be forced to stop or delay developing, manufacturing, selling or otherwise commercializing our products, product candidates or other infringing technology, or those we develop with our R&D partners.\nEven if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and divert management time and attention pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing, or distribution activities. If we are unable to avoid infringing the patent rights of others, we may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action, or challenge the validity of the patents in court, or redesign our products. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming. We may not have enough resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion.\nAny of these risks coming to fruition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nWe may be unsuccessful in developing, licensing, or acquiring intellectual property that may be required to develop and\ncommercialize our product candidates.\nOur programs may involve additional product candidates that may require the use of intellectual property or proprietary rights held by third parties; the growth of our business may depend in part on our ability to acquire, in-license or use these intellectual property and proprietary rights. However, we may be unable to acquire or in-license any third-party intellectual property or proprietary rights that may be key to development. Even if we can acquire or in-license such rights, we may be unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property and proprietary rights is a competitive area, and several more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property and proprietary rights that we may consider attractive or necessary. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, capital resources and agricultural development and commercialization capabilities.\nIn connection with his appointment as chair of our newly formed Scientific Advisory Board, Dr. Dan Voytas is no longer our Chief Science Officer, a position he held from our founding in January 2010 through February 2021. Our consulting agreement with Dr. Voytas, while he served as Chief Science Officer, and our current engagement letter with Dr. Voytas, as chair of our Scientific Advisory Board, each generally obligates Dr. Voytas to assign to us any intellectual property solely or jointly conceived, developed or reduced to practice by him in the course of the performance of his services to us. However, we do not have any rights, including any assignment or right of first refusal rights, to intellectual property conceived, developed, or reduced to practice by Dr. Voytas outside the course of the performance of his services to us, including in connection with his employment at the University of Minnesota.\nIn addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license intellectual property and proprietary rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property and proprietary rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment or at all. If we are unable to successfully acquire or in-license rights to required third-party intellectual property and proprietary rights or maintain the existing intellectual property and proprietary rights we have, we may have to cease development of the relevant program, product, or product candidate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe intend to license certain product candidates that we develop and, in some cases, our TALEN technology to third parties and will be dependent on them to successfully commercialize these product candidates or product candidates developed with our technology.\nIn addition to our seed sale go-to-market strategy, we intend to license certain product candidates that we develop to third parties for commercialization and sale under their own brands. In addition, we may out-license our technology platform to permit third parties to develop specific traits in specific crops. Our licensee customers could be global food processing companies, seed companies, biotechnology companies, germplasm providers, and growers. Once we license a product candidate to a customer, they will typically oversee its commercialization. Where we license our technology platform to a customer, they will typically oversee its development and commercialization. In both cases, our ability to achieve milestone payments or generate royalties will not be within our direct control.\nWe license our primary gene editing technology, TALEN, from Cellectis and also license other technology from Cellectis and the University of Minnesota. Accordingly, the economic terms of our partnership and licensing agreements will need to consider royalty payments that we are required to make to our licensors on revenue we generate under our partnership agreements and license arrangements.\nIf our licensees are delayed or unsuccessful in their development and commercialization efforts, as applicable, or if they fail to devote sufficient time and resources to support the marketing and selling efforts of those products, we may not receive milestone and/or royalty payments as expected, and our financial results could be harmed. Further, if these licensee customers fail to market licensed products or products developed with our licensed technology at prices that will achieve or sustain market acceptance for those products, our royalty revenues could be further harmed.\nSome of the licenses we may grant to our licensing partners may be exclusive, which could limit further licensing or partnership opportunities.\nSome of the licenses we may grant to our licensing partners with respect to certain product candidates or for the development of specific traits in identified crops using our TALEN technology may be exclusive within specified jurisdictions, so long as our licensing partners comply with the terms of the license agreements. That means that once a product candidate is licensed to a licensing partner, we may be generally prohibited from licensing that product candidate to any other third party. For example, our license with S&W provides S&W with exclusive rights to our improved quality alfalfa seed in several jurisdictions, including the United States. Similarly, once our technology is licensed for a specific trait in a specific crop, we may be generally prohibited from licensing our technology to any other third party for purposes of developing the same trait in the same crop or from using our technology ourselves to develop the same trait in the same crop. The limitations imposed by such exclusive licenses could prevent us from expanding our business and increasing our\nproduct development initiatives with new licensing partners, both of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Operation\nWe depend on key management personnel and attracting and retaining other qualified personnel, and our business could be harmed if we lose key management personnel or cannot attract and retain other qualified personnel.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the technical skills and continued service of certain members of our management and other key employees. The loss of the services of our management or key employees may delay or prevent the timely and successful execution of our business strategies and objectives. Additionally, most of our personnel are involved in research, development, and regulatory activities and competition for these highly skilled employees is intense. Our business is therefore dependent on our ability to recruit and maintain a highly skilled and educated workforce with expertise in a range of disciplines, including biology, biochemistry, plant genetics, agronomics, mathematics, agribusiness, and other subjects relevant to our operations. All our current employees are at-will employees, and the failure to retain or hire skilled and highly educated personnel could limit our growth and hinder our research and development efforts. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks, or a deficiency in our cyber-security.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of third parties on which we rely, and the data transmitted across these systems, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. The risk of data loss or a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations or loss of our data, it could result in a material disruption of our product development programs. For example, the loss of field trial data from completed or ongoing or planned field trials could result in delays in our regulatory clearance and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data and add additional time to our product development timelines. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, damage to our reputation, and the development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with Cellectis\nCellectis controls the direction of our business, and the concentrated ownership of our common stock and certain contractual rights Cellectis has will prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant decisions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Cellectis owned 64.7 percent of our outstanding shares of common stock. Pursuant to our stockholders\u2019 agreement, Cellectis will have certain contractual rights for so long as it beneficially owns at least 50 percent of the then outstanding shares of our common stock, including approval rights over a significant number of key aspects of our operations and management. In addition, though their rights are diminished compared to when they own more than 50 percent of our then outstanding common stock, Cellectis will also maintain certain significant rights, including a right to nominate a majority of our board of directors, as long as it beneficially owns at least 15 percent of the then outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, Cellectis controls the direction of our business, and the concentrated ownership of our common stock and the contractual rights described above will prevent stockholders from influencing significant decisions.\nIf Cellectis sells a controlling interest in our company to a third party, stockholders may not realize any change-of-control premium on shares of our common stock.\nCellectis has the ability, should it choose to do so, to sell some or all its shares of our common stock to a third party, which, if sufficient in size, could result in a change of control of our company. In certain circumstances, a third-party buyer may not be willing to pay a premium over the current market price of our common stock to acquire a controlling interest in Calyxt. Our stockholders would not have the right to participate in Cellectis\u2019 sale of our common stock to a third-party buyer nor would the third-party buyer be required to make an offer to acquire shares of our common stock from any stockholder other than Cellectis.\nIf Cellectis sold a controlling interest to a third party, any change-of-control premium on shares of our common stock would only accrue to Cellectis and not to any of our other stockholders. Additionally, through its ownership of a majority of our common stock and its\ncontractual rights under the stockholders\u2019 agreement, Cellectis will also determine whether a change of control of Calyxt occurs and if so, on what terms. In certain circumstances, including in connection with a proposed sale of Calyxt, Cellectis\u2019 interests as a stockholder of Calyxt may be different than the interests of other stockholders.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules of the NASDAQ and, as a result, rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. Our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nBecause Cellectis controls the majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the NASDAQ. Under these rules, a listed company of which more than 50 percent of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirement to have a majority independent board of directors or fully independent nominating and compensation committees. We are relying upon and expect to continue to rely upon some of these exemptions from the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements. Accordingly, not all stockholders will have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all the corporate governance requirements of the NASDAQ.\nCellectis and our directors who have relationships with Cellectis may have conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving our company.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that none of Cellectis, or any of its officers, directors, agents, shareholders, members, partners, subsidiaries (other than Calyxt and any future subsidiaries) and their affiliates will be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that Cellectis or any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to Cellectis or its affiliates instead of us, or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to us that such person or affiliate has directed to Cellectis or its affiliates.\nOur certificate of incorporation also provides that neither Cellectis nor any of its affiliates or any of our nonemployee directors will have any duty to refrain from engaging in a corporate opportunity in the same or similar lines of business in which we or any future subsidiaries now engage or propose to engage or otherwise competing with us or any of our future subsidiaries.\nOur license agreement with Cellectis does not restrict Cellectis from competing with us generally. Cellectis could develop and commercialize agricultural and food products that may compete with our current products or products in our pipeline using Cellectis intellectual property or technologies other than the gene editing technologies Cellectis has licensed to us. Cellectis could also use the licensed gene editing technologies to develop and commercialize products involving animals and animal cells and these animal-based products may be competitive with our plant-based products in certain circumstances.\nOne of our directors, Laurent Arthaud, is also a director of Cellectis, and Cellectis has the right to designate additional directors to serve on the Calyxt board of directors. Mr. Arthaud and any other directors designated by Cellectis who have relationships with Cellectis will have fiduciary duties to us and in addition will have duties to Cellectis.\nAccordingly, there may be real or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting both us and Cellectis, whose interests, in some circumstances, may be different than the interests of other stockholders or our interests.\nFuture sales of common stock by Cellectis or others of our common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, could depress the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Cellectis owned 64.7 percent of our outstanding shares of common stock. Future sales of these shares in the public market will be subject to the volume and other restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act for so long as Cellectis is deemed to be our affiliate, unless the shares to be sold are registered with the SEC. We are unable to predict with certainty whether or when Cellectis will sell a substantial number of shares of our common stock. The sale by Cellectis of a substantial number of shares, or a perception that such sales could occur, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.\nThe concentration of ownership of our common stock and provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nThe fact that Cellectis owns 64.7 percent of our common stock and Cellectis\u2019 rights under the stockholders\u2019 agreement to approve a sale of Calyxt and other changes in our Board of Directors and management will prevent a third party from attempting to acquire control of Calyxt and prevent changes in our Board of Directors or management, even if a sale of Calyxt or the changes would be considered beneficial by many stockholders other than Cellectis.\nFollowing the first date on which Cellectis no longer beneficially owns more than 50 percent of the outstanding shares of our common stock, certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other agreements may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire or discourage a third-party from attempting to acquire control of Calyxt. These provisions could also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third party\u2019s offer may be considered beneficial by many stockholders, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock. Further, these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, possibly depressing the market price of our common stock. As a result, stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares both while ownership of our common stock is concentrated with Cellectis and after.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and could remain volatile, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, volatility in response to various factors. Between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2020, the sales price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market fluctuated from a high of $26.42 per share at closing to a low of $2.48 per share at closing. Some factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include our quarterly operating results, our perceived prospects, or the perceptions of the market of our pipeline, our new products or our technologies, changes in securities analysts\u2019 recommendations or earnings estimates and our ability to meet such estimates, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, capital raising activity and other developments affecting us, our competitors or Cellectis.\nThese and other market and industry factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, regardless of our actual operating performance, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their common stock at a favorable price or at all and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and have reduced disclosure requirements that may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and not being required to submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as \u201csay-on-pay,\u201d \u201csay-on-frequency\u201d and \u201csay-on-golden parachutes\u201d. If investors may find our common stock less attractive because of our reliance on these exemptions and, as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.", "PERMNO": 16818, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CLXT"}
