{"cik": "910329", "company": "MEDIFAST INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn evaluating the Company, the following risk factors in addition to all other information in this Report should be considered carefully when reading this Report. If any of the events described below occurs, the Company\u2019s business financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties also may adversely affect our business and operations including those discussed in Item 7. - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K. If any of the following events actually occur, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to health related claims from our customers.\nA customer that suffers health problems may allege that the Medifast program contributed to the ailment. The Company is not currently the subject of any such claims; however, we would defend ourselves vigorously against such claims. Regardless of the ultimate outcome, such claims could reduce our brand image and customer loyalty and defending against such claims would be costly and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nMuch of our growth and future profitability depends on the effectiveness of our advertising spent in the Direct Response marketing channel.\nOur business success depends on our ability to attract and retain customers which significantly depends on our marketing practices. Our marketing expenditures may not result in increased revenue or generate sufficient awareness of the program or the brand to the consumer. We may not be able to manage our advertising expenditures in a cost effective manner which may increase the cost to acquire a new customer to an elevated level that will decrease profits.\nAdverse publicity associated with our products, ingredients, or sales channels, or those of similar companies, could harm our financial condition, operating results, and stock price.\nAdverse publicity, whether or not accurate, relating to the Company, our products or our operations, our sales channels and independent Health Coaches and franchisees could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition, operating results, and stock price. If the press were to come out with negative media about low-calorie diets, meal replacements, or soy protein this could harm our business. Even if not directed at Medifast, this perception could be instilled in our target market and cause harm to our operating results. In addition, it could lead to lawsuits or other legal challenges and could negatively impact our reputation, the market demand for our products, or our general business.\nOur lack of control over individual Health Coaches could result in claims against us.\nOur Health Coaches are independent contractors and, accordingly, we are not in a position to directly provide the same oversight as we would if Health Coaches were our own employees. As a result, there can be no assurance that our Health Coaches will participate in our marketing strategies or plans, accept our introduction of new products, or comply with our health coach policies and procedures despite our internal compliance efforts.\nWe can provide no assurances that the number of independent Health Coaches will increase or remain constant or that their productivity will increase. The number of active independent Health Coaches may not increase and could decline in the future. Independent Health Coaches may terminate their services at any time, and, like most direct selling companies, we experience turnover among new independent Health Coaches from year to year. We cannot accurately predict any fluctuation in the number and productivity of independent Health Coaches because we primarily rely upon existing independent Health Coaches to sponsor and train new independent Health Coaches and to motivate new and existing independent Health Coaches. Our operating results could be adversely affected if we and our existing independent Health Coaches do not generate sufficient interest in our business to successfully retain existing independent Health Coaches and attract new independent Health Coaches.\nExtensive federal, state and local laws regulate our business, products and direct selling program. While we have implemented health coach policies and procedures designed to govern their conduct and to protect the trademarks and brand of the Company, it can be difficult to enforce these policies and procedures because of the large number of Health Coaches and their statuses as independent contractors. Violations by our independent Health Coaches of applicable law or of our policies and procedures in dealing with customers could reflect negatively on our products and operations and harm our business reputation. In addition, it is possible that a court could hold us civilly or criminally accountable based on vicarious liability because of the actions of our Health Coaches.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate and result in a negative financial condition.\nCertain key personnel oversee integral components of our Company. Although we do not anticipate the departure of any key employees including but not limited to the executive management team, we cannot guarantee their tenure indefinitely. Our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our key executive officers. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could harm our business. If any of our key executive officers left the business could be harmed.\nIf we do not continue to develop innovative new services and products or if our services and products do not continue to appeal to the market, our business may suffer.\nThe weight management industry is subject to changing customer demands based, in large part, on the efficacy and popular appeal of weight management programs. Our future success depends on our ability to continue to develop and market new services and products and to enhance our existing services and products, each on a timely basis to respond to new and evolving customer demands, achieve market acceptance and keep pace with new nutritional and weight management developments. We may not be successful in developing, introducing on a timely basis or marketing any new or enhanced services and products, and we cannot assure you that any new or enhanced services or products will appeal to the market. Our failure to develop new services and products and to enhance our existing services and products or the failure of our services and products to continue to appeal to the market could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain members and subscribers and thus adversely affect our business.\nThird parties may infringe on our brand and other intellectual property rights, which may have an adverse impact on our business\nWe currently rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret, patent and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights, including our brand. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand, services and products could be diminished and our business may suffer. Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. Any legal action that we may bring to protect our brand and other intellectual property could be unsuccessful and expensive and could divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. In addition, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property, especially in internet-related businesses, are uncertain and evolving. We cannot assure you that these evolving legal standards will sufficiently protect our intellectual property rights in the future.\nOur ability to compete could be negatively affected in the event we fail to protect our brand names, trademarks or other intellectual property.\nBecause our business relies heavily on direct to consumer models, brand awareness is an important factor in our sales strategy. Failure to protect our brand or maintain an image of good standing with the public could result in a negative effect on our operations. Additionally, failure to protect our intellectual property could result in the arrival of a similar competitor which could reduce our competitive edge or decrease our market share.\nAs a manufacturer, we may be subject to product liability claims.\nAs a manufacturer and a distributor of products for human consumption and topical application, we could become exposed to product liability claims and litigation. Additionally, the manufacture and sale of these products involves the risk of injury to consumers due to tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination. To date, we have not been a party to any product liability litigation. We are aware of no instance in which any of our products are or have been defective in any way that could give rise to material losses or expenditures related to product liability claims. Although we maintain product liability insurance, which we believe to be adequate for our needs, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to such claims in the future or that our insurance coverage will be adequate.\nThe sale of ingested products involves product liability and other risks.\nLike other distributors of products that are ingested, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of our products results in illness or injury. The foods that we sell in the United States are subject to laws and regulations, including those administered by the FDA that establish manufacturing practices and quality standards for food products. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business as existing insurance coverage may not be adequate. The successful assertion or settlement of an uninsured claim, a significant number of insured claims or a claim exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage would harm us by adding costs to the business and by diverting the attention of senior management from the operation of the business. We may also be subject to claims that our products contain contaminants, are improperly labeled, include inadequate instructions as to use or inadequate warnings covering interactions with other substances. Product liability litigation, even if not meritorious, is very expensive and could also create adverse publicity and reduce our revenue. In addition, the products we distribute, or certain components of those products, may be subject to product recalls or other deficiencies. Any negative publicity associated with these actions would adversely affect our brand and may result in decreased product sales and, as a result, lower revenues and profits.\nA disruption in the supply of raw materials or the inability of third party manufacturing for certain products could affect operating results.\nWe rely heavily on our vendors to provide quality raw materials for us to utilize in our on-site manufacturing processes. Any disruption in the availability of these materials could potentially interrupt our ability to provide certain products to customers in a timely manner. Also certain products are currently manufactured through a third party. The availability of these products is prone to fluctuations dependent on the manufacturer\u2019s ability to secure and produce a quality product that meets our standards. Our inability to secure products in a timely manner could cause loss of revenue, loss of customers, and damage to our brand.\nDisruption to the Company\u2019s supply chain could adversely affect its business.\nDamage or disruption to the Company\u2019s suppliers or to the Company\u2019s manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, pandemic, strikes, or other reasons could impair the Company\u2019s ability to manufacture and/or sell its products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single location, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business or financial results.\nOur manufacturing activity is subject to certain risks.\nWe manufacture approximately 43% of the products sold to our customers. As a result, we are dependent upon the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facility in Owings Mills, Maryland. Those operations are subject to power failures, the breakdown, failure, or substandard performance of equipment, the improper installation or operation of equipment, natural or other disasters, and the need to comply with the requirements or directives of government agencies, including the FDA. There can be no assurance that the occurrence of these or any other operational problems at our facility would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture, use and disposal of chemicals, solid and hazardous waste, and other toxic and hazardous materials. Our manufacturing operations presently do not result in the generation of material amounts of hazardous or toxic substances. Nevertheless, complying with new or more stringent laws or regulations, or more vigorous enforcement of current or future policies of regulatory agencies, could require substantial expenditures by us that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Environmental laws and regulations require us to maintain and comply with a number of permits, authorizations, and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in our processes. Violations of those requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions and could require us to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured. The combined costs of curing incidents of non-compliance, resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities, or of satisfying new legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur business is subject to regulatory and legislative restrictions.\nA number of laws and regulations govern our production, operation, and advertising. The FTC and certain states regulate advertising, disclosures to consumers, privacy, consumer pricing or billing arrangements, and other consumer matters. Our direct selling distribution channel is subject to risk of interpretation of certain laws pertaining to the prevention of \u201cpyramid\u201d or \u201cchain sale\u201d schemes. Although we believe we are in full compliance, should the governing body alter or enforce the law in an unanticipated way, there may be a negative result on the Company\u2019s operations. Future laws and regulations could potentially have a material negative impact on the Company. Failure to comply with any regulations of current or future authoritative entities could have a detrimental effect on the Company\u2019s financial standing or operating results.\nNew or more stringent governmental regulations could adversely affect our business.\nFood production and the marketing of food products are highly regulated by a variety of federal, state, local and foreign agencies. Changes in laws or regulations, or interpretations of those laws, could result in additional regulatory requirements on us, such as the recently proposed food safety legislation that would require registration fees and mandatory product testing. These could increase our costs or restrict our marketing efforts, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected. Increased governmental interest in advertising practices may result in regulations that could require us to change or restrict our advertising practices.\nIncreased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us. We use natural gas, diesel fuel, and electricity in the manufacturing and distribution of our products. Legislation or regulation affecting these inputs could materially affect our profitability. In addition, climate change could affect our ability to procure commodities at reasonable costs and in quantities required. This may also necessitate unplanned capital expenditures.\nAdditionally, our selling practices are regulated by competition authorities in the United States and abroad. A finding that we are in violation of, or no longer in compliance with, applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nThe business may grow too quickly for the current infrastructure to handle.\nIf our advertising is extremely successful and our Take Shape For Life division sees a large uptick in recruitment, we may be unable to handle the growth from an operational perspective. Increasing demands on our infrastructure could cause long hold times in the call center as well as delays on our website. In addition, there could be delays in order processing, packaging and shipping. We could run out of a majority of our inventory if growth exceeded our production capacity. If these difficulties are encountered in a period of hyper-growth then our operating results could suffer.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our reliance upon information technology systems.\nOur success is dependent on the accuracy, reliability, and proper use of information processing systems and management information technology. Our information technology systems are designed and selected in order to facilitate order entry and customer billing, maintain Health Coach and preferred customer records, accurately track purchases and incentive payments, manage accounting, finance, and manufacturing operations, generate reports, and provide customer service and technical support. Although off-site data back-up is maintained, it is possible that an interruption in these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nAny deficiencies or shortcomings in our information technology could prevent an efficient execution of routine business procedures.\nWe rely heavily on our IT infrastructure to support major business components. Any disruption to the integrity of this support structure including but not limited to; software, telecommunications, Electronic Resource Platform, or the information technology architecture as a whole could severely limit our ability to provide customers and vendors with adequate service and operating responses. In addition, our financial reporting is directly correlated with our Company-wide software Microsoft Navision 4.0. Any compromise in the veracity of this system could severely alter the accuracy of our tracking, volumes, and general reporting including financial statements.\nOur business is subject to online security risks, including security breaches and identity theft.\nTo succeed, online commerce and communications must provide a secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Currently, a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their credit cards directly for all fees charged by us. We rely on third party software products to secure our credit card transactions. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent payment transactions and other security breaches, failure to prevent or mitigate such fraud or breaches may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur stock price may experience volatility due to fluctuations in our operating results.\nOur stock price is subject to fluctuations sometimes in response to our operating results, a competitor\u2019s operating results, other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, or our ability to meet stock analysts forecasts and our yearly revenue and EPS guidance. In addition, general trends in the weight-loss industry as a whole can have an effect on our stock price. These factors may have an adverse affect on the market price of our stock and cause it to fluctuate significantly.\nTaxation risks could subject us to liability for past sales, increase our costs and could impact our profitability.\nThe issuance by the Internal Revenue Service and/or state tax authorities of new tax regulations or changes to existing standards and actions by federal, state, or local tax agencies and judicial authorities with respect to applying applicable tax laws and regulations and the resolution of disputes with any taxing jurisdictions could subject us to liability for past sales, increase our costs and could impact our profitability.\nWe may not successfully make acquisitions or enter into joint ventures and we may not successfully integrate, operate or realize the anticipated benefits of such businesses.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may pursue selected acquisitions or joint ventures. We cannot assure you that we will be able to effect these transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any future acquisitions or joint ventures may require access to additional capital, and we cannot assure you that we will have access to such capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we enter into these transactions, we may not realize the benefits we anticipate or we may experience difficulties in integrating any acquired companies and products into our existing business, attrition of key personnel from acquired businesses, significant charges or expenses, higher costs of integration than we anticipated, or unforeseen operating difficulties that require significant financial and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations.\nOur ability to influence the control of our joint ventures may be limited by contract or otherwise. In addition, we may not be able to influence the occurrence or timing of distributions from our joint ventures. If any of the other investors in a joint venture fails to observe its commitments, the joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan or we may be required to increase our level of commitment. The interests of our joint venture partners may differ from ours, and they may cause such entities to take actions which are not in our best interest. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with our joint venture partners, we could lose our ability to operate in the geographies and/or markets in which they operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nConsummating these transactions could also result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense, as well as unforeseen contingent liabilities, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may also issue additional equity in connection with these transactions, which would dilute our existing stockholders.\nThe sale of our products in markets outside of the United States may subject us to risks.\nWe have entered into certain arrangements for the sale of our products in international markets and we plan to expand our international sales, marketing and distribution activities on our own and through arrangements with partners located in other countries. The sale, marketing and distribution of our products and programs in such locations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 economic and political instability;\n\u00b7 import or export licensing requirements;\n\u00b7 trade restrictions;\n\u00b7 product registration requirements;\n\u00b7 longer payment cycles;\n\u00b7 changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7 potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u00b7 potentially weak protection of intellectual rights.\nNew diets or pharmaceutical solutions could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe weight loss industry is highly subjective and influenced by many factors. For example, a low carbohydrate diet trend hit the United States several years ago and had an adverse impact on many weight loss companies, including ours. Another new diet could sweep the nation or consumer preferences could change, which is common in our industry. Our failure to adapt or respond quickly enough to these changes could have an adverse affect on our results of operations. In addition, pharmaceutical companies are constantly trying to develop safe, effective drugs that promote weight loss. If successful, many dieters could perceive this to be easier than the Medifast program, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur results of operations may decline as a result of a downturn in general economic conditions or consumer confidence.\nOur results of operations are highly dependent on product sales and program fees. A downturn in general economic conditions or consumer confidence and spending in any of our major markets could result in people curtailing their discretionary spending, which, in turn, could lead to a decrease in product sales in our Medifast Direct and Take Shape For Life divisions and a decrease in product and program fees at our Medifast Weight Control Centers. Any such reduction would adversely affect our results of operations.\nA competitor or new entrant into the market may develop a product and program similar to or more effective or more favorably perceived than ours.\nThe weight loss industry is highly competitive. We compete with a wide variety of commercial weight loss programs, pharmaceutical products, weight loss books, self-help diets, supplements and meal replacements. Many of our competitors are significantly larger than us and have more financial resources to develop new products and programs. Our business could be affected if one of our competitors or a new entrant to the market develops similar products and programs through similar marketing channels or more effective or more favorably perceived products. This could result in lower sales as well as pricing competition which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results from operations.", "PERMNO": 80054, "SIC": 2090, "TIC": "MED"}
