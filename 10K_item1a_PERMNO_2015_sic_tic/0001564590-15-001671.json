{"cik": "1342126", "company": "Morgans Hotel Group Co.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nSet forth below are risks that we believe are material to investors who purchase or own our common stock. You should consider carefully the following risks, together with the other information contained in and incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the descriptions included in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe anticipate that we will need to refinance our indebtedness from time to time to repay our debt, and our inability to refinance on favorable terms, or at all, could harm our business and operations.\nWe have $450.0 million of mortgage debt on Hudson and Delano South Beach which matures in February 2016, with three one-year extension options to extend the maturity to February 2019 if certain conditions are met. We also have 75,000 shares of Series A preferred securities for which the dividend rate will increase to 20% in October 2016.\nOur internally generated cash may be inadequate to repay our indebtedness prior to maturity, and we may be required to repay debt from time to time through refinancings of our indebtedness, offerings of equity or debt, asset dispositions, joint venture transactions or other financing transactions. In addition, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of any refinancing result in higher interest rates on any refinancing, our interest expense would increase, which could harm our business and operations. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all, we might be forced to sell one or more of our properties on disadvantageous terms, which might result in losses to us, or default on the indebtedness.\nWe have substantial debt, and we may incur additional indebtedness, which may negatively affect our business and financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $605.7 million of outstanding consolidated indebtedness, including capital lease obligations. Our share of indebtedness held by our joint venture entities, which debt is generally nonrecourse to us with the exception of certain standard nonrecourse carve-out guarantees, was approximately $64.7 million as of December 31, 2014.\nWith respect to our nonrecourse carve-out guarantees, a violation of any of the nonrecourse carve-out guaranty provisions, including fraud, misapplication of funds and other customary nonrecourse carve-out provisions, could cause the debt to become fully recourse to us. Our substantial debt could negatively affect our business and operations in several ways, including:\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to use a substantial portion of our funds from operations to make required payments on principal and interest, which would reduce funds available for operations and capital expenditures, future business opportunities and other purposes;\n\u00b7\nmaking us more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns and reducing our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional cash for operations, capital or to finance development projects or acquisitions in the future; and\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to dispose of properties in order to make required payments of interest and principal.\nWe also may incur additional debt in connection with any future development projects or acquisitions. We may in some instances borrow funds to finance development projects or acquisitions. In addition, we may incur further mortgage debt by obtaining loans secured by the properties we acquire or in our existing portfolio.\nOur working capital and liquidity reserves may not be adequate to cover all of our cash needs and we may have to obtain additional debt financing. Sufficient financing may not be available or, if available, may not be available on terms acceptable to us. Additional borrowings for working capital purposes will increase our interest expense, and therefore may harm our business and operations.\nOur organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. If we increase our leverage, the resulting increase in debt service could adversely affect our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and harm our business and operations.\nWe or our joint ventures did not repay the mortgage and mezzanine financing on several of our properties upon maturity, and in the future we or our joint ventures may elect to cease making payments on additional mortgages or sell a property at a loss if it fails to generate cash flow to cover its debt service or if we or our joint ventures are unable to refinance the debt at maturity, which could result in foreclosure proceedings, negative publicity and reduce the number of properties we or our joint ventures own or operate, as well as our revenues, and could negatively affect our ability to obtain loans or raise equity or debt financing in the future.\nIn the past, we or our joint ventures have not repaid the mortgage and mezzanine financings on several of our properties upon maturity and have been subject to foreclosure and other actions by lenders, including with respect to Mondrian SoHo, among others properties. See Part II, \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements - Mondrian SoHo.\u201d\nIn the future, we or our joint venture entities or other owners of hotels we manage, may cease making payments on the mortgages on one or more of our properties if the property fails to generate cash flow to cover its debt service or if we, the joint venture entities or other owners are unable to refinance the mortgage at maturity. To the extent we, our joint venture entities or other owners of hotels we manage do not meet debt service obligations and we or the joint venture entity or other owners default on a mortgage or other loan, the lender may have the right to exercise various remedies under the loan documents, including foreclosing on the applicable property and, in certain situations, termination of our management agreement. Foreclosures can be expensive and lengthy processes, which could have a substantial negative effect on our operating results. Lenders may assert numerous claims and take various actions against us, including, without limitation, seeking a deficiency judgment or seeking to terminate our management agreement. Foreclosures may also create a negative public perception of us, resulting in a diminution of our brand value, and may negatively impact our ability to obtain loans or raise equity or debt financing in the future. Foreclosure actions may also require a substantial amount of resources and negotiations, which may divert the attention of our executive officers from other activities, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor a property, a foreclosure may also result in increased tax costs to us if we recognize income upon foreclosure. For tax purposes, a foreclosure on any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage. If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize a taxable gain on foreclosure but would not receive any cash proceeds.\nIn addition, certain mortgage or other loan defaults could result in a default under our corporate debt, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nCertain of our debt instruments contain covenants that may limit our ability to borrow and restrict our operations, and if we fail to comply with such covenants, such failure could result in a default under one or more of our debt instruments.\nSome of our existing indebtedness, and the indebtedness of certain of our joint ventures, contain limitations on the ability to incur additional debt on specific properties, as well as financial and other covenants relating to the performance or operation of those properties. If these covenants restrict us or the applicable joint venture from engaging in activities that we believe would benefit those properties, our growth may be limited. If we or the applicable joint venture fail to comply with these covenants, consents or waivers from compliance with these covenants will need to be obtained, which may take time, cost money, or require prepayment of the debt containing the restrictive covenants.\nThe Hudson/Delano 2014 Mortgage Loan contains restrictions on the ability of the borrowers to incur additional debt or liens on their assets and on the transfer of direct or indirect interests in Hudson or Delano and the owners of Hudson and Delano and other affirmative and negative covenants and events of default customary for multiple asset commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) loans. For more information on the Hudson/Delano 2014 Mortgage Loan, see Part I, \u201cItem I. Business - 2014 and Other Recent Transactions and Developments - Hudson and Delano South Beach Loan Refinancing.\u201d\nIn addition, our trust preferred securities include limitations on our ability to sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers, consolidations and certain acquisitions. These covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that we believe would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nIf we were required to make payments under the \u201cbad boy\u201d nonrecourse carve-out guarantees that we have provided in connection with certain mortgages and related mezzanine loans, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have provided standard \u201cbad boy\u201d nonrecourse carve-out guarantees in connection with certain mortgages and related mezzanine loans, which are otherwise nonrecourse to us or have agreed to indemnify joint venture partners who have provided such guarantees for our pro rata share of certain liabilities under such guarantees. See, for example, nonrecourse carve-out guarantees and\nother guarantees or indemnification obligations provided by us in connection with mortgage and mezzanine loans associated with Mondrian South Beach and Mondrian SoHo properties, as described in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Other Liquidity Matters.\u201d Although we believe that our \u201cbad boy\u201d carve-out guarantees and related indemnification obligations are not guarantees of payment in the event of foreclosure or other actions of the foreclosing lender that are beyond our control, some lenders in the real estate industry have sought to make claims for payment under such guarantees. In the event such a claim were made against us under one of our \u201cbad boy\u201d carve-out guarantees or related indemnification obligations following foreclosure on a related mortgage or mezzanine loan and such claim were successful, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nDisruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability and the ability of our joint venture partners, development partners, or other third-party owners to obtain capital or financing for development of properties and other purposes on reasonable terms.\nAs part of our strategy, we focus on management opportunities, which may entail the investment of key money and/or equity. We also may continue, through joint ventures, to acquire and develop, or redevelop, hotel properties as suitable opportunities arise. These investments could require significant capital expenditures, especially since these properties usually generate little or no cash flow until the project\u2019s completion. To the extent the expenditures are significant, we, our joint venture partners, our development partners or other third-party owners may rely upon the availability of debt or equity capital.\nDuring the most recent global economic recession, U.S. and global markets experienced significant price volatility, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability and other market dislocations. These circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain types of capital or financings less attractive, and in some cases resulted in the unavailability of capital or financing. Although the U.S. and global markets have begun improving, the economic recovery continues to be modest, as uncertainty remains as to its sustainability, and the effects of continued weakness in certain areas of global economies, as well as our financial condition or the financial condition of our properties, may prevent or negatively impact our ability to access additional capital or financing for development of properties and other purposes at reasonable terms, which may cause us, our joint venture partners, or other third-party owners, to suspend, abandon or delay development and other activities and otherwise negatively affect our business. As a result, we, our joint venture partners, our development partners, or other third-party owners, may be forced to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive capital or financing and adjust business plans accordingly. These events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock and therefore could materially adversely affect our growth strategy.\nRecovery from the most recent global economic crisis has been modest, and demand for travel, hotels, dining and entertainment, has not returned to pre-recession levels. In addition, boutique hotels such as ours remain more susceptible to future economic downturns than other segments of the hospitality industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe performance of the hospitality industry has traditionally been closely linked with the general economy and is sensitive to personal discretionary spending levels. In an economic downturn, boutique hotels may be more susceptible to a decrease in revenues, as compared to hotels in other segments that have lower room rates, because our hotels generally target business and high-end leisure travelers. Business and high-end leisure travelers may seek to reduce travel costs by limiting travel, choosing lower cost hotels or otherwise reducing the costs of their trips. These changes could result in steep declines in average daily room rates or occupancy, or both. Profitability also may be negatively affected by the relatively high fixed costs of operating hotels such as ours, when compared to other segments of the hospitality industry.\nWhile the U.S. economy has improved since the most recent economic crisis, the recovery may stall or conditions may worsen, reducing the amounts people spend on travel, hotels, dining and entertainment. Moreover, global markets and economic conditions remain uncertain and difficult to predict. If economic conditions do not improve as anticipated, or worsen again, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We can also provide no assurance that boutique hotels, such as ours, will fully recover to prior levels or that they will recover at a comparable rate with the rest of the hospitality industry.\nOur success depends on the value of our name, image and brands, and if the demand for our hotels and their features decreases or the value of our name, image or brands diminishes, our business and operations would be adversely affected.\nOur success depends, to a large extent, on our ability to shape and stimulate consumer tastes and demands by producing and maintaining innovative, attractive, and exciting properties and services, as well as our ability to remain competitive in the areas of design and quality. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard or that we will be able to anticipate and react to changing consumer tastes and demands in a timely manner.\nFurthermore, a high media profile, including new digital platforms, is an integral part of our ability to shape and stimulate demand for our hotels with our target customers. A key aspect of our marketing strategy is to focus on attracting media coverage. If we fail to attract that media coverage, we may need to substantially increase our advertising and marketing costs, which would adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, other types of marketing tools, such as traditional advertising and marketing, may not be successful in attracting our target customers.\nOur business would be adversely affected if our public image, reputation or brands were to be diminished, including as a result of any failure to remain competitive in the areas of design, quality and service or as a result of negative social media content. If we do not maintain our hotel properties at a high level, which necessitates, from time to time, capital expenditures and the replacement of furniture, fixtures and equipment, or the owners of the hotels that we manage fail to develop or maintain the properties at our standards, the value of our name, image or brands would be diminished and our business and operations would be adversely affected.\nNegative publicity concerning our properties or our business could harm our brands and reputation as well as increase our costs and reduce our revenues.\nOur brands and our reputation regarding the quality of our hotels and services are key to attracting guests to our properties. An incident involving the potential safety or security of our associates or our guests, or adverse publicity relating to the geographic areas in which any of our properties are located, or the hotel or travel industry generally may harm our brands and reputation, cause a loss of consumer confidence in the industry, and negatively impact our results of operations. The continued expansion in the use of social media and multiple digital platforms over recent years could increase our exposure to negative publicity that could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our financial position.\nBoutique hotels are a highly competitive segment of the hospitality industry. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business and operations will be adversely affected by declines in our average daily room rates or occupancy, or both.\nWe generally compete in the \u201cboutique\u201d or \u201clifestyle\u201d hotel segment of the hospitality industry. We believe that this segment is highly competitive. Competition within the boutique hotel segment is also likely to increase in the future. Competitive factors in the hospitality industry include name recognition, quality of service, convenience of location, quality of the property, pricing and range and quality of food and beverage services and amenities offered. We also compete with other operators of full service hotels, including major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands. Most of these major hospitality chains are larger than we are based on the number of properties or rooms they manage, franchise or own or based on the number of geographic locations in which they operate. Our competitors generally also have broader guest loyalty programs which may enable them to attract more customers and more effectively retain such guests. Market perception that we no longer provide innovative property concepts and designs would adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete for guests effectively, we would lose market share, which could adversely affect our business and operations.\nAll of our properties are located in areas with numerous competitors, many of whom have substantially greater financial and marketing resources than us. In addition, new hotels may be constructed in the areas in which our properties are located, possibly without corresponding increases in demand for hotel rooms. New or existing competitors could offer significantly lower rates or more convenient locations, services or amenities or significantly expand, improve or introduce new service offerings in markets in which our hotels compete, thereby posing a greater competitive threat than at present. The resulting decrease in our revenues could adversely affect our business and operations.\nOur hotels are geographically concentrated in a limited number of cities and, accordingly, we could be disproportionately harmed by an economic downturn or other financial pressures in these cities or a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or earthquake.\nThe concentration of our hotels in a limited number of cities exposes us to greater risk to local economic, business and other conditions than more geographically diversified hotel companies. Morgans, Royalton, Hudson and Mondrian SoHo, located in Manhattan, represented approximately 41.1% of our total guest rooms for all the hotels we manage and Hudson, our only wholly-owned New York City hotel as of December 31, 2014, represented approximately $85.2 million, or 40.1%, of our consolidated hotel revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014. An economic downturn, a natural disaster, a terrorist attack or similar disaster in New York would likely cause a decline in the Manhattan hotel market and adversely affect occupancy rates, the financial performance of our New York hotels and our overall results of operations. In addition, we operate three hotels in Miami and three hotels in London, making us susceptible to economic slowdowns and other risks in these markets, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the pace of new lodging supply, especially in New York City and Miami, has increased over the past several years as many projects initiated before the economic downturn came to fruition and new projects commenced as the economy recovered. In New York City and South Beach, new lodging supply impacted our hotels\u2019 occupancy and constrained rate growth, and we expect that these trends will continue through 2015 as the new supply in these markets is absorbed.\nIn addition, certain of our hotels are located in markets that are more susceptible to natural disasters than others, which could adversely affect those hotels, the local economies, or both. Specifically, the Miami area, where Delano South Beach, Shore Club and Mondrian South Beach are located, is susceptible to hurricanes and California, where Mondrian Los Angeles and Clift are located, is susceptible to earthquakes.\nThe threat of terrorism may negatively impact the hospitality industry generally and may have a particularly adverse impact on major metropolitan areas.\nThe threat of terrorism may negatively impact hotel occupancy and average daily rate, due to resulting disruptions in business and leisure travel patterns and concerns about travel safety. Hotels in major metropolitan areas, such as New York and London, which represented approximately 61.6% of our total guest rooms for all the hotels we managed at December 31, 2014, may be particularly adversely affected due to concerns about travel safety. The impact on such major metropolitan areas may be particularly severe because of the importance of transient business travel, which includes the corporate and premium business segments that generally pay the highest average room rates, to those markets. The possibility of future attacks may hamper business and leisure travel patterns and, accordingly, the performance of our business and our operations.\nOur operations are sensitive to currency exchange risks, and we cannot predict the impact of future exchange-rate fluctuations on our business and operating results.\nOur operations are sensitive to currency exchange risks. Changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our operating results. For example, all else being equal, a stronger U.S. dollar could harm international tourism in our domestic markets and may increase U.S. travel to our international markets. As foreign currencies depreciate against the U.S. dollar, it becomes more expensive, in terms of those depreciating foreign currencies, to pay for our U.S. hotel services. Conversely, all else being equal, a depreciating U.S. dollar could affect demand for our U.S. hotel services but may decrease U.S. travel to our international markets.\nDue to the concentration of our hotels in global cities, such as New York and Miami, frequently visited by guests from other countries, we could be impacted by the change in the value of foreign currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar. For example, if the value of the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against the value of the Euro, guests from Europe may not travel to New York or Miami during 2015 as frequently, and/or room rates we are able to charge international guests may be driven down, which could have a significant impact on our operating results.\nWe have incurred substantial losses and have a significant net deficit and may continue to incur losses in the future.\nWe reported pre-tax net losses of $48.6 million, $43.4 million, and $55.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Our net losses primarily reflected losses related to restructuring and disposal costs, development costs, impairment charges and non-operating costs, decreased revenues due to renovation work at our Owned Hotels, losses in equity of unconsolidated joint ventures, interest expense and depreciation and amortization charges.\nWe may not be able to successfully compete for desirable hotel management, development, acquisition or investment opportunities.\nWe may not be successful in identifying or completing hotel projects that are consistent with our strategy. We compete for management agreements based primarily on the value and quality of our management services and reputation, our brand recognition, our ability and willingness to invest key money into projects, the level of our management fees, and the terms of our management agreements.\nWe compete with hotel operating companies, institutional pension funds, private equity investors, real estate investment trusts, owner-operators of hotels and others who are engaged in hotel operating or real estate investment activities for the operation, development, and acquisition of hotels. We also have experienced challenges in securing new projects in recent years as a result of the occurrence of certain events at our corporate level, including proxy contests, our now settled dispute with Yucaipa, and our strategic review process. In addition, competition for suitable hotel management, development, investment, and acquisition opportunities is intense and may increase in the future. Some competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than we do, and as such, will be able to invest more or accept greater risk than we can prudently manage. These competitors may limit the number of suitable hotel management, development, investment and acquisition opportunities for us by driving up the price we must pay for such\nopportunities. In addition, our potential hotel management or development projects or acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive investors because they may have greater resources, be willing to pay more, have a more compatible operating philosophy, or better relationships with hotel franchisors, sellers or lenders. Furthermore, the terms of our management agreements are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors, among other things. We cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue or that we will be able to enter into future collaborations, renew agreements, or enter into new agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those that exist today.\nEven if we are able to successfully identify and acquire other hotel management or development projects, acquisitions or investments, they may not yield the returns we expect and, if financed using our equity capital, may be dilutive. We also may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with evaluating and negotiating potential hotel management or development projects or acquisitions, including ones that we or others are subsequently unable to complete. We may underestimate the costs necessary to bring a hotel management agreement or development project or acquired property up to the standards established for its intended market position or to re-develop it as a Morgans Hotel Group brand hotel or the costs to integrate it with our existing operations. Significant costs of hotel development projects or acquisitions could materially impact our operating results, including costs of uncompleted hotel development projects or acquisitions, as they would generally be expensed in the time period during which they are incurred.\nIf we are unable to maintain good relationships with third-party property owners and/or if we terminate agreements with defaulting third-party property owners, our revenues could decrease and we may be unable to maintain or expand our presence.\nWe earn fees for managing and franchising/licensing hotels and, since our shift in 2011 to an \u201casset light\u201d strategy, we are dependent on maintaining and developing positive relationships with third-party owners and joint venture partners. Third-party developers and owners and joint venture partners are focused on maximizing the value of their investment and working with a management company that can help them maximize profitability and return on investment. The effectiveness of our management, the value of our brands, and the rapport that we maintain with our third-party owners and joint venture partners impact renewals of existing agreements and are also important factors for existing or new third-party owners or joint venture partners considering doing additional business with us in the future. If we are unable to maintain these relationships, we may be unable to maintain existing agreements or effectively grow our portfolio, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nSome of our existing and future development pipeline may not be developed into new hotels, which could materially adversely affect our growth prospects.\nThe commitments of owners and developers under our pipeline hotel management agreements and letters of intent are subject to numerous conditions. The eventual development and construction of our pipeline not currently under construction or in the initial stages of construction, or the signing of a management agreement in the case of letters of intent, is subject to numerous risks, including, in certain cases, obtaining governmental and regulatory approvals and adequate financing. As a result, we cannot assure you that our development pipeline will be completed and developed into new hotels.\nIntegration of new hotels may be difficult and may adversely affect our business and operations.\nThe success of any hotel management or development project or acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from integrating new hotels with our existing operations. For instance, we may manage, develop or acquire new hotels in geographic areas in which our management may have little or no operating experience and in which potential customers may not be familiar with our existing hotels, name, image or brands. These hotels may attract fewer customers than our existing hotels, while at the same time, we may incur substantial additional costs with these new hotel properties. As a result, the results of operations at new hotel properties may be inferior to those of our existing hotels. Unanticipated expenses and insufficient demand at a new hotel property, therefore, could adversely affect our business. Our success in realizing anticipated benefits and the timing of this realization depend upon the successful integration of the operations of the new hotel. This integration is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. The difficulties of combining new hotel properties with our existing operations include, among others:\n\u00b7\ncoordinating sales, distribution and marketing functions;\n\u00b7\nintegrating information systems;\n\u00b7\npreserving the important licensing, distribution, marketing, customer, labor, and other relationships of a new hotel;\n\u00b7\ncosts relating to the opening, operation and promotion of new hotel properties that are substantially greater than those incurred in other geographic areas; and\n\u00b7\nconverting hotels to our brands.\nWe may not accomplish the integration of new hotels or food and beverage operations smoothly or successfully. The diversion of the attention of our management from our existing operations to integration efforts and any difficulties encountered in combining operations could prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits from the new addition and could adversely affect our business and operations.\nThe use of joint ventures or other entities, over which we may not have full control, for hotel development projects or acquisitions could prevent us from achieving our objectives.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future acquire, develop or redevelop hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties, acquiring non-controlling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a property, joint venture or other entity. As of December 31, 2014, we owned our Mondrian South Beach hotel through a 50/50 joint venture and our Mondrian SoHo hotel through a joint venture in which our interest was 20%.\nTo the extent we own properties through joint ventures or other entities, we may not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the property, joint venture or other entity. Investments in joint ventures or other entities may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Likewise, partners may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Such investments may also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions if neither we nor our partner have full control over the joint venture or other entity. Disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent management from focusing their time and effort on our business. Consequently, actions by, or disputes with, our partners might result in subjecting properties owned by the joint venture to additional risk. In addition, we may, in certain circumstances, be liable for the actions of our partners.\nFor example, in the first half of 2014, we and our Mondrian SoHo joint venture partner litigated over our Mondrian SoHo hotel management agreement, among other things, as detailed further in \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings - Litigations Regarding Mondrian SoHo.\u201d Additionally, due to our Mondrian Istanbul joint venture partner\u2019s failure to achieve certain agreed milestones in the development of the Mondrian Istanbul hotel, in early 2014, we exercised our put option under the joint venture agreement that requires our joint venture partner to buy back our equity interests in the Mondrian Istanbul joint venture. In addition, we have initiated proceedings in an English court seeking payment of the put option amount against the individual shareholders behind the joint venture partner. The parties are also seeking various other judicial remedies in Turkey. These actions have resulted in significant management distraction and the incurrence of significant legal fees.\nWe are exposed to the risks of a global market, which could hinder our ability to maintain and expand our international operations.\nWe currently manage hotels in the United States and the United Kingdom and have a franchise hotel in Turkey and currently plan to expand to other international markets. The success and profitability of any future international operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, such as:\n\u00b7\nglobal economic conditions, such as economic contraction, economic uncertainty or the perception by our customers of weak or weakening economic conditions;\n\u00b7\npolitical or economic instability;\n\u00b7\nchanges in governmental regulation;\n\u00b7\ntrade restrictions;\n\u00b7\nforeign currency controls;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing operations in certain foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nwar, civil unrests, or threats and heighted travel security measures;\n\u00b7\nwork stoppages or other changes in labor conditions;\n\u00b7\ntaxes;\n\u00b7\npayments terms; and\n\u00b7\nseasonal reductions in business activity in some parts of the world.\nFurthermore, changes in policies and/or laws of the United States or foreign governments resulting in, among other things, higher taxation, currency conversion limitations or the expropriation of private enterprises could reduce the anticipated benefits of our international operations. Any actions by countries in which we conduct business to reverse policies that encourage foreign trade could adversely affect our business relationships and gross profit. In addition, we may be restricted in moving or repatriating funds attributable to our international properties without the approval of foreign governmental authorities or courts. These limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nEstablishing operations in any foreign country or region presents risks such as those described above, as well as risks specific to the particular country or region. We may not be able to maintain and expand our international operations successfully, and as a result, our business operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have high fixed costs, including property taxes and insurance costs, which we may be unable to adjust in a timely manner in response to a reduction in revenues. In addition, our property taxes have increased in recent years and we expect those increases to continue.\nThe costs associated with owning and operating hotels are significant, some of which may not be altered in a timely manner in response to changes in demand for services. Failure to adjust our expenses may adversely affect our business and operations. For example, pursuant to the terms of our agreements with the labor unions for our New York City and San Francisco hotels, we may not unilaterally reduce the wages of the employees subject to these agreements, and are restricted in the manner in which we may layoff and/or alter the schedule of union employees.\nProperty taxes and insurance costs are a significant part of our operating expenses. In recent years, our real property taxes have increased and those increases may continue. Our real property taxes may increase as property tax rates change and as the values of properties are assessed and reassessed by taxing authorities. Our real estate taxes do not depend on our revenues, and generally we cannot reduce them, other than by filing appeals with the applicable tax jurisdictions to reduce our tax assessments.\nInsurance premiums for the hospitality industry have increased significantly in recent years, and continued escalation may result in our inability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable premium rates. A continuation of this trend would appreciably increase the operating expenses of our hotels. Additionally, we anticipate that our directors and officers insurance may increase in future years. If we do not obtain adequate insurance, to the extent that any of the events not covered by an insurance policy materialize, our financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nIn the future, our properties may be subject to increases in real estate and other tax rates, utility costs, operating expenses, insurance costs, repairs and maintenance and administrative expenses, as well as reductions in our revenues due to the effects of economic downturns, which could reduce our cash flow and adversely affect our financial performance. If our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our expenses in a timely manner, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAny failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our trademarks are critical to our success. We rely on trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights. The success of our business depends in part upon our continued ability to use our trademarks to increase brand awareness and further develop our brands in both domestic and international markets. Monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. Litigation has been and may continue to be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, may result in counterclaims or other claims against us and could significantly harm our results of operations. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nFrom time to time, we apply to have certain trademarks registered. There is no guarantee that such trademark registrations will be granted. We cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our trademarks in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate to prevent imitation of our trademarks by others. The unauthorized reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brands and their market acceptance, competitive advantages or goodwill, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may have disputes with, or be sued by, third parties for infringement or misappropriation of their proprietary rights, which could have a negative impact on our business.\nOther parties may assert trademark, copyright or other intellectual property rights that have a negative impact on our business. We cannot assure you that others will not seek to block our use of certain marks or seek monetary damages or other remedies for the prior use of our brand names or other intellectual property or the sale of our products or services as a violation of their trademark, copyright or other proprietary rights. Defending any claims, even claims without merit, could divert our management\u2019s attention, consume significant time, result in costly settlements, litigation or restrictions on our business and damage our reputation.\nIn addition, there may be prior registrations or use of trademarks in the United States or foreign countries for similar or competing marks or other proprietary rights. In all such countries it may be possible for any third-party owner of a national trademark registration or other proprietary right to enjoin or limit our expansion into those countries or to seek damages for our use of such intellectual property in such countries. In the event a claim against us was successful and we could not obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property or redesign or rename our products or operations to avoid infringement, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. Securing registrations does not fully insulate us against intellectual property claims, as another party may have rights superior to our registration or our registration may be vulnerable to attack on various grounds.\nOur business may be harmed as a result of litigation.\nWe are a party to several ongoing material legal proceedings. These proceedings are described below in Item 3 of Part I of this report under the heading \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and also in note 8 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of Part IV of this report. Should an unfavorable outcome occur in some or all of these legal proceedings or any litigation for which we have indemnified Hakkasan in connection with the TLG Equity Sale, or if successful claims and other actions are brought against us in the future, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be seriously harmed. In addition, litigation may divert the attention of our management from other activities, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause Clift is leased pursuant to a 99-year lease and a portion of Hudson is the lease of a condominium interest, we are subject to the risk that these leases could be terminated or that we could default on payments under the lease, either of which would cause us to lose the ability to operate all or a portion of these hotels.\nOur rights to operate Clift in San Francisco are based upon our interest under a 99-year lease. In addition, a portion of Hudson in New York is a condominium interest that is leased to us under a 99-year lease. Pursuant to the terms of the leases for these hotels, we are required to pay all rent due and comply with all other lessee obligations under the leases. Any transfer, including a pledge, of our interest in a lease may require the consent of the applicable lessor and its lenders. As a result, we may not be able to sell, assign, transfer or convey our lessee\u2019s interest in any hotel subject to a lease in the future absent consent of such third parties even if such transactions may be in the best interest of our stockholders.\nThe lessor may require us, at the expiration or termination of the lease to surrender or remove any improvements, alterations or additions to the land or hotel at our own expense. The leases also generally require us to restore the premises following a casualty or taking and to apply in a specified manner any proceeds received in connection therewith. We may have to restore the premises if a material casualty, such as a fire or an act of God, occurs, the cost of which may exceed any available insurance proceeds. The termination of any of these leases could cause us to lose the ability to continue operating all or a portion of these hotels, which would materially affect our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, we may be unable to make payments under the leases if we are not able to operate the properties profitably. For example, the Clift lease agreement provides for base annual rent of approximately $6.0 million per year until October 2014. Thereafter, the base rent increases at five-year intervals by a formula tied to increases in the Consumer Price Index, with a maximum increase of 40% and a minimum increase of 20% at October 2014, and a maximum increase of 20% and a minimum increase of 10% at each five-year rent increase date thereafter. As a result of the first such increase, effective October 14, 2014, the annual rent increased to $7.6 million. The lease is nonrecourse to us. We can provide no assurance that we can operate the property at a profit now or upon future rent increases under the lease. Morgans Group also provides a limited guaranty, whereby Morgans Group has agreed to guarantee losses of up to $6.0 million suffered by the lessors in the event of certain \u201cbad boy\u201d type acts.\nWe have invested, and may continue to invest in the future, in select properties which have residential components, and this strategy may not yield the returns we expect and may result in disruptions to our business or strain management resources.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may seek to leverage awareness of our hotel brands by acquiring, developing and/or managing non-hotel properties, such as condominium developments and other residential projects, including condominiums or apartments. We may invest in these opportunities solely or with joint venture partners. For example, in August 2006, together with a 50/50 joint venture partner, we acquired an apartment building in the South Beach area of Miami Beach, Florida, which we renovated and converted into a hotel and condominium project and re-branded as Mondrian South Beach. This strategy, however, may expose us to additional risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development or re-development costs and/or lower than expected sales;\n\u00b7\nlocal residential real estate market conditions and renewed downturns in such market conditions;\n\u00b7\ncost overruns, including development or re-development costs that exceed our original estimates, could make completion of the project uneconomical;\n\u00b7\nland, insurance and development or re-development costs continue to increase and may continue to increase in the future, and we may be unable to attract rents or sales prices that compensate for these increases in costs;\n\u00b7\ndevelopment or re-development of condominium properties usually generate little or no cash flow until the project\u2019s completion and the sale of a significant number of condominium units and may experience operating deficits after the date of completion and until such condominium units are sold;\n\u00b7\nfailure to achieve expected occupancy and/or rent levels at residential apartment properties within the projected time frame, if at all;\n\u00b7\nfailure to attract sufficient participation in the hotel rental program by condominium hotel unit owners may result in a low hotel room inventory making it difficult to run the hotel profitably;\n\u00b7\ncondominium hotel unit owners may attempt to rent their units as hotel units outside of the hotel rental program, which may result in confusion and guest relations issues and reputational damage to our brands; and\n\u00b7\nwe may abandon development or re-development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring any such opportunities.\nOverall project costs may significantly exceed the costs that were estimated when the project was originally undertaken, which will result in reduced returns, or even losses, from our investment.\nWe may be involved in disputes, from time to time, with the owners of the hotels that we manage and premature termination of our management agreements could hurt our financial performance.\nThe nature of our responsibilities under our management agreements to manage hotels that are not wholly-owned by us may be subject to interpretation and will from time to time give rise to disagreements. To the extent that such conflicts arise, we seek to resolve them by negotiation with the relevant parties. In the event that such resolution cannot be achieved, litigation may result in damages or other remedies against us. Such remedies could in certain circumstances include termination of the right to manage the relevant property.\nAdditionally, although our hotel management, franchise and license agreements are generally long-term, they may be subject to early termination in specified circumstances, or we may agree to early termination as circumstances require. Certain of our hotel management agreements and franchise or license agreements contain performance tests that stipulate certain minimum levels of operating performance, which could result in early termination of our hotel management, if we fail or elect not to cure. We may disagree with hotel owners on how the performance criteria are calculated or whether they have been met.\nIn addition, some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of third-party hotel properties (or have interpreted hotel management agreements as \u201cpersonal services contracts\u201d). This means, among other things, that property owners may assert the right to terminate management agreements even where the agreements provide otherwise, and some courts have upheld such assertions regarding management agreements and may do so in the future. In the event of any such termination, we may need to enforce our right to damages for breach of contract and related claims, which may cause us to incur significant legal fees and expenses. Any damages we ultimately collect could be less than the projected future value of the fees and other amounts we would have otherwise collected under the management agreement.\nSeveral of our hotels are also subject to mortgage and mezzanine debt, and in some instances our management, franchise or license fee is subordinated to the debt. Some of our management agreements also may be terminated by the lenders on foreclosure or certain other related events. With some of our existing management, franchise and license agreements, and with all of our new management, franchise and license agreements for hotels under development we attempt to negotiate, non-disturbance agreements or similar protections with the mortgage lender, or to require that such agreements be entered into upon securing of financing, in order to protect our agreements in the event of foreclosure. However, we are not always successful in imposing these requirements, and some of our new development projects and existing hotels do not have non-disturbance or similar protections, which may make the related agreements subject to termination by the lenders on foreclosure or certain other related events. Even if we have such non-disturbance protections in place, they may be subject to conditions and may be difficult or costly to enforce in a foreclosure situation. See, for example Part I, Item 3.\u201cLegal Proceedings - Litigations Regarding Mondrian SoHo.\u201d\nWe are party to numerous contracts and operating agreements, certain of which limit our activities through restrictive covenants or consent rights. Violation of those covenants or failure to receive consents could lead to termination of those contracts or operating agreements.\nWe are party to numerous contracts and operating agreements, many of which are integral to our business operations. Certain of those contracts and operating agreements, including our joint venture agreements, generally require that we obtain the consent of the other party or parties before taking certain actions and/or contain restrictive covenants that could affect the manner in which we conduct our business. Our failure to comply with restrictive covenants or failure to obtain consents could provide the beneficiaries of those covenants or consents with the right to terminate the relevant contract or operating agreement or seek damages against us. If those claims relate to agreements that are integral to our operations, any termination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Hospitality Industry\nA number of factors, many of which are common to the lodging industry and beyond our control, could affect our business.\nA number of factors, many of which are common to the lodging industry and beyond our control, could affect our business, including those described elsewhere in this section, as well as the following:\n\u00b7\nover-building of hotels in the markets in which we operate which results in increased supply and would likely adversely affect occupancy and revenues at our hotels;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of guests;\n\u00b7\ndependence on business, commercial and leisure travelers and tourism;\n\u00b7\ndecreased airline capacity and routes;\n\u00b7\ntravel-related accidents;\n\u00b7\nfear of outbreaks or outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases;\n\u00b7\ndependence on group and meeting/conference business and the impact of decreased corporate budgets and spending;\n\u00b7\nincreases in energy costs, property taxes or insurance costs;\n\u00b7\nincreases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors that may not be offset by increased room rates;\n\u00b7\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the availability, cost and terms of financing;\n\u00b7\nadverse effects of worsening conditions in the lodging industry;\n\u00b7\nchanges in laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances;\n\u00b7\nchanges in taxes and regulations that impact wages (including minimum wage increases) and benefits; and\n\u00b7\nrisks generally associated with the ownership of hotel properties and real estate.\nThese factors and the resulting reputational harm could have an adverse effect on individual properties and our financial condition and results of operations as a whole.\nThe illiquidity of real estate investments and the lack of alternative uses of hotel properties could significantly limit our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties and harm our financial condition.\nBecause real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more of our properties in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions is limited. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property.\nAlthough we evaluate alternative uses throughout our portfolio, including residential conversion and other opportunities, hotel properties may not readily be converted to alternative uses. The conversion of a hotel to alternative uses would also generally require substantial capital expenditures and may not provide a more profitable return than the use of the hotel property prior to that conversion.\nWe may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. We may not have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements and as a result our ability to sell the property would be limited. In acquiring a hotel, we may agree to lock-out provisions that materially restrict us from selling that hotel for a period of time or impose other restrictions on us. These factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties could significantly harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe hotel business is capital intensive and requires capital improvements to remain competitive; the failure to timely fund such capital improvements, the rising cost of such improvements and increasing operating expenses could negatively impact our ability to compete, reduce our cash flow and adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur hotel properties have an ongoing need for renovations and other capital improvements to remain competitive, including replacement, from time to time, of furniture, fixtures and equipment. To compete effectively, we will need to, or convince our joint venture partners or other third-party owners to, make capital expenditures to maintain our innovative property concepts and designs. In addition, we will need to make capital expenditures to comply with applicable laws and regulations.\nIf we, our joint venture entities or other owners of our hotels are not able to fund capital improvements solely from cash provided from hotel operations, debt or equity capital may be needed, which may not be available. If we, our joint venture entities or other owners of our hotels cannot access debt or equity capital, capital improvements may need to be postponed or cancelled, which could harm our ability to remain competitive.\nIn addition, renovations and other capital improvements to our hotels may be expensive and may require us to close all or a portion of the hotels to customers during such renovations, affecting occupancy and average daily rate. These capital improvements may give rise to the following additional risks, among others:\n\u00b7\nconstruction cost overruns and delays;\n\u00b7\nexposure under completion and related guarantees;\n\u00b7\nuncertainties as to market demand or a loss of market demand after capital improvements have begun;\n\u00b7\ndisruption in service and room availability causing reduced demand, occupancy and rates; and\n\u00b7\npossible environmental problems.\nAs a result, capital improvement projects may increase our expenses and reduce our cash flows and our revenues. If capital expenditures exceed our expectations, this excess would have an adverse effect on our available cash.\nSeasonal variations in revenue at our hotels can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues.\nThe hospitality industry is seasonal in nature. This seasonality can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues. Our revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters. Our quarterly earnings may also be adversely affected by factors outside our control, including weather conditions and poor economic conditions. As a result, we may have to enter into short-term borrowing arrangements in certain quarters in order to offset these fluctuations in revenues.\nInformation technology system failures, delays in the operation of our information technology systems or system enhancement failures could reduce our revenues and profits and harm the reputation of our brands and our business.\nOur success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our information technology systems. For example, we depend on our central reservation system, which allows bookings by hotels directly, via telephone through our call centers, by travel\nagents, online through our website www.morganshotelgroup.com, and through our online reservations partners. In addition, we depend on information technology to run our day-to-day operations, including, among others, hotel services and amenities such as guest check-in and check-out, housekeeping and room service and systems for tracking and reporting our financial results and the financial results of our hotels.\nOur information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and similar events. The occurrence of any of these natural disasters or unanticipated problems at any information technology facilities we manage or subscribe to, or any of our call centers could cause interruptions or delays in our business or loss of data, or render us unable to process reservations.\nIn addition, if our information technology systems are unable to provide the communications capacity that we need, or if our information technology systems suffer problems caused by installing system enhancements, we could experience failures or interruptions. If our information technology systems fail and our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans are not adequate to address such failures, or if our property and business interruption insurance does not sufficiently compensate us for any losses that we may incur, our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brands and our business could be harmed.\nCyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in faulty business decisions, harm to our reputation, or subject us to fines, costs, or lawsuits.\nOur business is reliant upon technology systems and networks, including systems and networks managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store information and to conduct many of our business activities and transactions with clients, vendors and other third parties. Furthermore, we are required to comply with legal, regulatory and contractual obligations which are designed to protect personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers, stockholders and employees. The legal, regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information security and privacy is constantly evolving and the hospitality industry is under increasing attack by cyber-criminals in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Such information includes but is not limited to large volumes of customer credit and payment card information. Maintaining the integrity of our systems and networks is critical to the success of our business operations and to the protection of customer, stockholder, employee or our data. Accordingly, significant actual or potential theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of customer, stockholder, employee or our data by cybercrime or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy policies with respect to such data may result in fines, damage to our reputation, litigation or regulatory actions against us and transfer of information and otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have implemented security measures designed to protect against such breaches of security. Despite these measures, we cannot be sure that our systems and networks will not be subject to breaches or interference. The size and complexity of our information security systems, and those of our third-party vendors and business partners with whom we contract, make such systems potentially vulnerable to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors, or from attacks by malicious third parties. The frequency of third party cyber attacks in the hospitality industry have increased in recent years. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise, including organized criminal groups, \u201chacktivists,\u201d and others. Furthermore, given the ever-changing tactics used by cyber criminals, there can be no assurance that a compromise of our systems would be discovered promptly. A successful attack or other security breach could result in unauthorized access to or the disclosure or loss of customer, stockholder, employee or other data, which in turn may result in legal claims, regulatory scrutiny and liability, reputational damage, the incurrence of costs to eliminate or mitigate further exposure and damage to our business. We have, in the past, been subject to systems, network and data breaches, including breaches that resulted in unauthorized access to customer data. There can be no assurance that such incidents will not occur again. We have obtained cyber-risk insurance to mitigate this risk, but it is of limited scope and amount, may not cover us against all of the possible damage it would suffer from a significant successful cyber attack.\nIf we fail to maintain pace with developments in technology necessary for our business, our operations and competitive position could be harmed.\nSophisticated information technology and other systems are critical for the hospitality industry, including systems used for our central reservations, revenue management, and property management, as well as technology systems that we make available to our guests. These information technology and other systems must be refined, updated, and/or replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis. Developing and maintaining these systems may require significant capital. If we are unable to replace or introduce information technology and other systems as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs or schedules when these systems become outdated or need replacing, or if we are unable to achieve the intended benefits of any new information technology or other systems, our operations could be harmed and our ability to compete effectively could be diminished.\nOur business and operations are heavily regulated and a failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in an adverse effect on our business.\nAny failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in an adverse effect on our business. Our various properties are subject to numerous laws, including those relating to the preparation and sale of food and beverages, including alcohol. The failure to comply with such laws could subject us to a number of adverse consequences, including fines or even suspension or revocation of liquor licenses. We are also subject to laws governing our relationship with our employees in such areas as minimum wage and maximum working hours, overtime, working conditions, hiring and firing employees and work permits. Also, our ability to remodel, refurbish or add to our existing properties may be dependent upon our obtaining necessary building permits from local authorities. The failure to obtain any of these permits could adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and net income through capital improvements of our properties. In addition, we are subject to the numerous rules and regulations relating to state and federal taxation. Compliance with these rules and regulations requires significant management attention. Any failure to comply with all such rules and regulations could subject us to fines or audits by the applicable taxation authority.\nWe are subject to restrictions imposed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-corruption laws and regulations of other countries applicable to our operations, such as the UK Bribery Act. Anti-corruption laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons in order to receive or retain business. The compliance programs, internal controls and policies we maintain and enforce to promote compliance with applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws may not prevent our associates, contractors or agents from acting in ways prohibited by these laws and regulations. We are also subject to trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and the U.S. Department of Commerce. Our compliance programs and internal controls also may not prevent conduct that is prohibited under these rules. The United States may impose additional sanctions at any time against any country in which or with whom we do business. Depending on the nature of the sanctions imposed, our operations in the relevant country could be restricted or otherwise adversely affected. Any violations of anti-corruption laws and regulations or trade sanctions could result in significant civil and criminal penalties, reduce our profits, disrupt our business or damage our reputation. In addition, an imposition of further restrictions in these areas could increase our cost of operations, reduce our profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities that would otherwise support growth.\nUninsured and underinsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are responsible for insuring our hotel properties as well as obtaining the appropriate insurance coverage to reasonably protect our interests in the ordinary course of business except in connection with some of our hotels where insurance is provided for by the respective property owners. Additionally, each of our leases and loans typically specifies that comprehensive insurance be maintained on each of our hotel properties, including general liability, cyber liability, fire and extended coverage. There are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes and floods or terrorist acts, which may be uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be subject to insurance coverage limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments. We will use our discretion in determining amounts, coverage limits, deductibility provisions of insurance and the appropriateness of self-insuring, with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance coverage on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms. Uninsured and underinsured losses could harm our financial condition and results of operations. We could incur liabilities resulting from loss or injury to our hotels or to persons at our hotels. Claims, whether or not they have merit, could harm the reputation of a hotel or cause us to incur expenses to the extent of insurance deductibles or losses in excess of policy limitations, which could harm our results of operations.\nIn the event of a catastrophic loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover the full current market value or replacement cost of our lost investment. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. In that event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. In the event of a significant loss, our deductible may be high and we may be required to pay for all such repairs and, as a consequence, it could materially adversely affect our financial condition. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors might also keep us from using insurance proceeds to replace or renovate a hotel after it has been damaged or destroyed. Under those circumstances, the insurance proceeds we receive might be inadequate to restore our economic position on the damaged or destroyed property.\nWhen our current insurance policies expire, we may encounter difficulty in obtaining or renewing property or casualty insurance on our properties at the same levels of coverage and under similar terms. Such insurance may be more limited and for some catastrophic risks (e.g., earthquake, hurricane, flood and terrorism) may not be generally available at current levels. Even if we are able to renew our policies or to obtain new policies at levels and with limitations consistent with our current policies, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain such insurance at premium rates that are commercially reasonable. If we were unable to obtain adequate insurance on our properties for certain risks, it could cause us to be in default under specific covenants on certain of our indebtedness or other contractual commitments that require us to maintain adequate insurance on our properties to protect against the risk of loss. If this were to occur, or if we were unable to obtain adequate insurance and our properties experienced damage which would otherwise have been covered by insurance, it could materially adversely affect our financial condition and the operations of our properties.\nIn addition, local jurisdictions in the United States where our hotel properties are located do not allow for insurance to cover damages that are characterized as punitive or similar damages. As a result, any claims or legal proceedings, or settlement of any such claims or legal proceedings that result in damages that are characterized as punitive or similar damages may not be covered by our insurance. If these types of damages are substantial, our financial resources may be adversely affected.\nEnvironmental and other governmental laws and regulations could increase our compliance costs and liabilities and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur hotel properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to the environment, fire and safety and access and use by disabled persons. Under these laws, courts and government agencies have the authority to require us, if we are the owner of a contaminated property, to clean up the property, even if we did not know of or were not responsible for the contamination. These laws also apply to persons who owned a property at the time it became contaminated. In addition to the costs of clean-up, environmental contamination can affect the value of a property and, therefore, an owner\u2019s ability to borrow funds using the property as collateral or to sell the property. Under such environmental laws, courts and government agencies also have the authority to require that a person who sent waste to a waste disposal facility, such as a landfill or an incinerator, to pay for the clean-up of that facility if it becomes contaminated and threatens human health or the environment.\nFurthermore, various court decisions have established that third parties may recover damages for injury caused by property contamination. For instance, a person exposed to asbestos while staying in or working at a hotel may seek to recover damages for injuries suffered. Additionally, some of these environmental laws restrict the use of a property or place conditions on various activities. For example, some laws require a business using chemicals (such as swimming pool chemicals at a hotel) to manage them carefully and to notify local officials that the chemicals are being used.\nWe could be responsible for the types of costs discussed above. The costs to clean up a contaminated property, to defend against a claim, or to comply with environmental laws could be material. Future laws or regulations may impose material environmental liabilities on us, or the current environmental condition of our hotel properties may be affected by the condition of the properties in the vicinity of our hotels (such as the presence of leaking underground storage tanks) or by third parties unrelated to us.\nOur hotel properties are also subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, all public accommodations must meet various federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act could require removal of access barriers and non-compliance could result in the U.S. government imposing fines or in private litigants\u2019 winning damages. If we are required to make substantial modifications to our hotels, whether to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other changes in governmental rules and regulations, our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In addition, we are required to operate our hotel properties and laundry facilities in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and become applicable to our properties.\nClaims of illness or injury associated with the service of food and beverage to the public could adversely affect us.\nClaims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food and beverage business, and a number of these claims may exist at any given time. As a result, we could be adversely affected by negative publicity, whether or not accurate, regarding food quality or handling claims at one or more of the restaurants, bars or other food and beverage venues that we operate. In addition to decreasing sales and profitability at these restaurants, bars or other food and beverage venues, adverse publicity could negatively impact our reputation, hindering our ability to renew contracts on favorable terms or to obtain new business.\nLabor shortages could restrict our ability to operate our properties or grow our business or result in increased labor costs that could reduce our profits.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, train, manage and engage our employees. Our properties are staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week by thousands of employees. If we are unable to attract, retain, train and engage skilled workers, our ability to manage and staff our properties adequately could be impaired, which could harm our reputation. Staffing shortages could also hinder our ability to grow and expand our business. Because payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at our properties, a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase our labor costs, which could reduce our profits and the profits of our third-party owners.\nOur hotels may be faced with labor disputes or, upon expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, a strike, which would adversely affect the operation of our hotels.\nWe rely heavily on our employees to provide high-quality personal service at our hotels and any labor dispute or stoppage caused by poor relations with a labor union or the hotels\u2019 employees could adversely affect our ability to provide those services, which could reduce occupancy and room revenue, tarnish our reputation and hurt our results of operations. Most of our employees who work at Morgans, Royalton, Hudson, Mondrian SoHo and Clift are members of local labor unions. Our relationship with our employees or the union could deteriorate due to disputes relating to, among other things, wage or benefit levels or management responses to various economic and industry conditions. The collective bargaining agreement governing the terms of employment for employees working in our New York City hotels expires on June 30, 2019. The collective bargaining agreement with the unions representing the majority of the Clift employees expires in August 2018.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Corporate Structure\nMorgans Hotel Group Co. is a holding company with no operations.\nMorgans Hotel Group Co. is a holding company and we conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries. Morgans Hotel Group Co. does not have, apart from its ownership of Morgans Group, any independent operations. As a result and although we have no current plan to do so, we would rely on dividends and other payments or distributions from Morgans Group and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends on our common stock, although our current debt agreements restrict Morgans Hotel Group Co. from paying dividends. We also rely on dividends and other payments or distributions from Morgans Group and our other subsidiaries to meet our debt service and other obligations, including our obligations in respect of our trust preferred notes and Series A preferred securities. The ability of Morgans Group and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or distributions to us will depend on Morgans Group\u2019s operating results.\nIn addition, because Morgans Hotel Group Co. is a holding company, claims of our stockholders will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations (whether or not for borrowed money) of our subsidiaries. Therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, our assets and those of our subsidiaries will be able to satisfy the claims of our stockholders only after all of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 liabilities and obligations have been paid in full.\nSubstantially all of our businesses are held through our direct subsidiary, Morgans Group. Other than with respect to 75,446 membership units held by affiliates of NorthStar Capital Investment Corp. and LTIP Units convertible into membership units issued as part of our employee compensation plans, we own all of the outstanding membership units of Morgans Group. We may, in connection with acquisitions or otherwise, issue additional membership units of Morgans Group in the future. Such issuances would reduce our ownership of Morgans Group. Because our stockholders do not directly own Morgans Group units, they do not have any voting rights with respect to any such issuances or other corporate level activities of Morgans Group.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals, could delay, deter or prevent a change in control and could limit the price certain investors might be willing to pay for our stock.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit changes in control of our Company not approved by our Board of Directors or changes in the composition of our Board of Directors, which could result in the entrenchment of current management. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\na prohibition on stockholder action through written consents;\n\u00b7\na requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called by the Board of Directors;\n\u00b7\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations;\n\u00b7\nlimitations on the ability of stockholders to amend, alter or repeal the bylaws; and\n\u00b7\nthe authority of the Board of Directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with such terms as the Board of Directors may determine and additional shares of our common stock.\nWe are also afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents us from engaging in a business combination with a person who becomes a 15% or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date such person acquires such status unless certain Board of Directors or stockholder approvals are obtained. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nThe Yucaipa Investors, who own our Series A preferred securities and warrants to purchase our common stock, may have interests that are not aligned with yours and will have substantial influence over the vote on key matters requiring stockholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Yucaipa American Alliance Fund II, L.P. and Yucaipa American Alliance (Parallel) Fund II, L.P., (collectively, the \u201cYucaipa Investors\u201d), held warrants to purchase 12,500,000 shares of our common stock and 75,000 shares of our Series A preferred securities.\nFor so long as the Yucaipa Investors own a majority of the outstanding Series A preferred securities, they also have consent rights, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, over transactions involving the acquisition of the Company by any third party, pursuant to which the Series A preferred securities are converted or otherwise reclassified into or exchanged for securities of another entity, and certain other transactions where a vote of the holders of the Series A preferred securities is required by law or our certificate of incorporation.\nIn addition, subject to the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Yucaipa Investors have consent rights over certain transactions for so long as they collectively own or have the right to purchase through the cashless exercise of the warrants to purchase 6,250,000 shares of our common stock, including, subject to certain exceptions and limitations:\n\u00b7\nthe sale of all or substantially all of our assets to a third party;\n\u00b7\nthe acquisition (including by merger, consolidation or other business combination) by us of a third party where the equity investment by us is $100.0 million or greater;\n\u00b7\nour acquisition by a third party; or\n\u00b7\nany change in the size of our Board of Directors to a number below 7 or above 9.\nFor so long as the Yucaipa Investors collectively own or have the right to purchase through exercise of the warrants (assuming a cash exercise of such warrants) 875,000 shares of our common stock, we have agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to cause our Board of Directors to nominate and recommend to our stockholders the election of a person nominated by the Yucaipa Investors as a director of the Company and to use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Yucaipa Investors\u2019 nominee is elected to our Board of Directors at each such meeting. If that nominee is not elected as a director at a meeting of stockholders, the Yucaipa Investors have certain Board of Director observer rights. Further, if we do not, within 30 days from the date of such meeting, create an additional seat on the Board of Directors and make available such seat to the nominee, the dividend rate on the Series A preferred securities increases by 4% during any time that a Yucaipa Investors\u2019 nominee is not a member of our Board of Directors.\nAccordingly, the Yucaipa Investors have substantial control rights over our business and may be able to decide the outcome of key corporate decisions. The interests of the Yucaipa Investors may differ from the interests of our other stockholders, and they may cause us to take or not take certain actions with which you may disagree. Third parties may be discouraged from making a tender offer or bid to acquire us because of this concentration of ownership, and we may have more difficulty raising equity or debt financing due to the Yucaipa Investors\u2019 significant ownership and ability to influence certain decisions.\nPayment of dividends on our Series A preferred securities and any redemptions of warrants may negatively impact our cash flow and the value of our common stock.\nOn October 15, 2009 we issued 75,000 shares of Series A preferred securities to the Yucaipa Investors. The holders of such Series A preferred securities are entitled to cumulative cash dividends, payable in arrears on every three-month anniversary following the original date of issuance if such dividends are declared by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof, at a rate of 8% until October 2014, 10% per year until October 2016, and 20% per year thereafter. In addition, should the Yucaipa Investors\u2019 nominee fail to be elected to our Board of Directors, the dividend rate would increase by 4% during any time that the Yucaipa Investors\u2019 nominee is not a director. From July 14, 2013 through May 14, 2014, the dividend rate was 12% as a result of the Yucaipa Investors\u2019 nominee not being elected or appointed to our Board of Directors. On May 14, 2014, at our annual shareholder meeting, a Board of Directors nominee representing the Yucaipa Investors was elected as a director and the dividend rate on the Series A preferred securities returned to the stated rate of 8%. Accordingly, the current dividend rate on the Series A preferred securities is 10%.\nWe have the option to accrue any and all dividend payments. As of December 31, 2014, we have not declared or paid any dividends. The accrual of these dividends may have a negative impact on the value of our common stock. In addition, the payment of these dividends may limit our ability to grow and compete by reducing our ability to use capital for other business and operational needs.\nWe have the option to redeem any or all of the Series A preferred securities at any time. Our working capital and liquidity reserves may not be adequate to cover these redemption payments should we elect to redeem these securities, which would place pressure on us to find outside sources of financing that may or may not be available.\nOur basis in our Owned Hotels is generally substantially less than their fair market value which will decrease the amount of our depreciation deductions and increase the amount of recognized gain upon sale.\nSome of the hotels which were part of our formation and structuring transactions at the time of our initial public offering in 2006 were contributed to us in tax-free transactions. Accordingly, our tax basis in the assets contributed was not adjusted in connection with our initial public offering and is generally substantially less than the fair market value of the contributed hotels as of the date of our initial public offering. We also intend to generally use the \u201ctraditional\u201d method for making allocations under Section 704(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as opposed to the \u201ccurative\u201d or \u201cremedial\u201d method for making such allocations. Consequently, (i) our depreciation deductions with respect to our hotels will likely be substantially less than the depreciation deductions that would have been available to us had our tax basis been equal to the fair market value of the hotels as of the date of our initial public offering, (ii) we may recognize gain upon the sale of an asset that is attributable to appreciation in the value of the asset that accrued prior to the date of our initial public offering, and (iii) we may utilize available net operating losses against the potential gain from the sale of an asset.\nThe change of control rules under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code may limit our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future taxable income.\nWe have net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes. Generally, NOL carryforwards can be used to reduce future taxable income. Our use of our NOL carryforwards will be limited, however, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d) if we undergo a change in ownership of more than 50% of our capital stock over a three-year period as measured under Section 382 of the Code. These complex change of ownership rules generally focus on ownership changes involving stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of our stock, including certain public \u201cgroups\u201d of stockholders as set forth under Section 382 of the Code, including those arising from new stock issuances and other equity transactions. We believe we experienced an ownership change for these purposes in April 2008, but that the resulting annual limit on our NOL carryforwards did not affect our ability to use the NOL carryforwards that we had at the time of that ownership change. Our stock is actively traded and it is possible that we will experience another ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code, measured for this purpose by including transfers and issuances of stock that took place after the ownership change that we believe occurred in April 2008. If we experienced another ownership change, the resulting annual limit on the use of our NOL carryforwards (which would equal the product of the applicable federal long-term tax-exempt rate, multiplied by the value of our capital stock immediately before the ownership change, then increased by certain existing gains recognized within 5 years after the ownership change if we have a net built-in gain in our assets at the time of the ownership change) could result in a meaningful increase in our federal and state income tax liability in future years. Whether an ownership change occurs by reason of public trading in our stock is not within our control and the determination of whether an ownership change has occurred is complex. No assurance can be given that we have not already undergone, or that we will not in the future undergo, another ownership change that would have a significant adverse effect on the value of our stock. In addition, the possibility of causing an ownership change may reduce our willingness to issue new stock to raise capital.\nNon-U.S. holders owning more than 5% of our common stock may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain recognized on the disposition of our common stock.\nBecause of our significant U.S. real estate holdings, we believe that we are a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d as defined under Section 897 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, any \u201cnon-U.S. holder\u201d (as defined in the applicable tax provisions) will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if such non-U.S. holder has held, directly or indirectly, 5% of our common stock at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the disposition and such non-U.S. holder is not eligible for any treaty exemption.\nChanges in market conditions or sales of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. In addition to the possibility that we may sell shares of our common stock in a public offering at any time, we also may issue shares of common stock in connection with the warrants we issued to the Yucaipa Investors and their affiliates, grants of restricted stock or LTIP Units or upon exercise of stock options that we grant to our directors, officers and employees. All of these shares may be available for sale in the public markets from time to time. As of December 31, 2014, there were:\n\u00b7\nup to 12,500,000 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants we issued to the Yucaipa Investors at an exercise price of $6.00 per share, utilizing a cashless exercise method only, resulting in a net share issuance;\n\u00b7\n1,124,740 shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options, all of which were exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of $15.07 per share;\n\u00b7\n941,157 LTIP Units outstanding exercisable for a total of 941,157 shares of our common stock;\n\u00b7\n333,402 restricted stock units outstanding and subject to vesting requirements for a total of 333,402 shares of our common stock; and\n\u00b7\nup to 3,771,343 shares of our common stock available for future grants under our equity incentive plans.\nMost of the outstanding shares of our common stock are eligible for resale in the public market and certain holders of our shares have the right to require us to file a registration statement for purposes of registering their shares for resale. A significant portion of these shares is held by a small number of stockholders. If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline, which may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. We are unable to predict the effect that sales of our common stock may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nOur stock price has been and continues to be volatile.\nThe stock markets have, in the past, experienced extreme price fluctuations. These fluctuations have not always been related to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is traded. During the recent global economic downturn and thereafter, our stock price has been extremely volatile. Our stock price may continue to fluctuate as a result of various factors, such as:\n\u00b7\ngeneral industry and economic conditions, such as the lingering effects of the recent global economic downturn;\n\u00b7\ngeneral stock market volatility unrelated to our operating performance;\n\u00b7\nannouncements relating to significant corporate transactions;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in our quarterly and annual financial results;\n\u00b7\noperating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u00b7\nchanges in government regulation or proposals relating thereto; and\n\u00b7\nsales or the expectation of sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market.", "PERMNO": 91096, "SIC": 7011, "TIC": "MHGC"}
