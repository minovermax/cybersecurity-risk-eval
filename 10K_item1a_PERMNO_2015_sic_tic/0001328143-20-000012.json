{"cik": "1328143", "company": "Adamas Pharmaceuticals Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future growth prospects. Our business could be harmed by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nRisks related to the commercialization of GOCOVRI\u00ae (amantadine) extended release capsules\nOur success depends heavily on the success of GOCOVRI for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy, with or without concomitant dopaminergic medications. To the extent GOCOVRI is not commercially successful, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially harmed.\nWe have invested and continue to invest a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development, approval and commercialization of GOCOVRI for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy, with or without concomitant dopaminergic medications. The success of GOCOVRI will depend on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022GOCOVRI\u2019s efficacy and safety profile;\n\u2022our success in the marketing, sales, and distribution of GOCOVRI;\n\u2022acceptance of GOCOVRI by physicians, hospital administrators, patients, third-party payers, and others in the healthcare community;\n\u2022coverage and adequate reimbursement of GOCOVRI by third-party payers;\n\u2022willingness and ability of patients to pay out of pocket for GOCOVRI;\n\u2022successfully establishing and maintaining commercial manufacturing with third parties;\n\u2022effectively competing with other approved or used medicines and future compounds in development;\n\u2022continued demonstration of an acceptable safety profile of GOCOVRI; and\n\u2022obtaining, maintaining, enforcing, and defending intellectual property rights and claims.\nIf we are not successful in addressing these issues, or one or more of these factors negatively affect us, we could experience significant delays or an inability to further commercialize GOCOVRI, which would materially harm our business.\nIf we are unable to recruit and retain qualified personnel and third-party distributors, our business will be substantially harmed.\nCompetition for biotechnology and pharmaceutical employees, sales personnel and other key personnel is intense. We have experienced and may in the future experience difficulty attracting and retaining qualified candidates to fill open positions and may be required to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment and retention efforts. We are required to expend significant time and resources to market, sell, and distribute GOCOVRI to neurologists and movement disorder specialists in a credible, persuasive, and compliant manner consistent with applicable laws. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to recruit, employ, appropriately train, and retain experienced sales professionals to successfully execute our commercialization strategies and tactics, including educating potential customers about the benefits and risks of GOCOVRI and its proper administration.\nMoreover, there is no guarantee that the strategies, tactics and marketing messages, or the distribution and reimbursement capabilities that we have established will be successful. Specifically, for distribution of GOCOVRI, we\nare heavily dependent on third-party logistics, pharmacy and distribution partners. If they are unable to perform effectively or if they do not provide efficient distribution of the medicine to patients, our business will suffer.\nFailure to successfully obtain coverage and reimbursement for GOCOVRI in the United States, or the availability of coverage and reimbursement only at limited levels, would diminish our ability to generate product revenue.\nOur ability to commercialize GOCOVRI successfully in the United States will depend in part on the extent to which we obtain and maintain coverage and reimbursement for GOCOVRI from third-party payers, including government health administration authorities, such as those that administer the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and private health insurers. Patients who are prescribed medicine for the treatment of their conditions generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Coverage and adequate reimbursement from both governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payers are critical to GOCOVRI\u2019s commercial success. Coverage and reimbursement decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor newer drug products when more established or cheaper therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. For example, even though other versions of amantadine are not approved for dyskinesia, some payers have asked physicians if patients have had prior experience with such versions or required that physicians actually prescribe such versions prior to providing reimbursement for GOCOVRI. For some patients, coverage and reimbursement may not be available for GOCOVRI.\nEven if we obtain coverage for GOCOVRI, the resulting reimbursement rates might not be adequate or may require co-payments or co-insurance payments that patients find unacceptably high. Coverage and reimbursement determinations by third-party payers can impact the demand for GOCOVRI and therefore our revenues. Patients may choose not to use GOCOVRI if coverage is not provided or reimbursement is inadequate to cover a significant portion of its cost. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or are available only to limited levels, our business could be harmed.\nOur inability to obtain and maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private third-party payers for GOCOVRI could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, and our overall financial condition.\nWe face substantial competition in the commercialization of GOCOVRI.\nThe commercialization of pharmaceutical products is highly competitive, and we face substantial competition with respect to GOCOVRI. For example, although GOCOVRI is the first and only FDA-approved medicine for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy, with or without concomitant dopaminergic medications, we face competition from various branded and generic drugs approved for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease that physicians either have historically used or may use in attempt to manage dyskinesia. If approved, we will also face competition from investigational drugs in late stage development for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease, and may also face competition from drugs currently in development for dyskinesia in Parkinson\u2019s disease or for Parkinson\u2019s disease from a number of pharmaceutical companies.\nMany of our competitors, including a number of large pharmaceutical companies that compete directly with us, have significantly greater financial resources commercializing approved products than we do. Also, many of our competitors are large pharmaceutical companies that will have a greater ability to reduce prices for their competing drugs in an effort to gain market share and undermine the value proposition that we might otherwise be able to offer to payers.\nUnforeseen safety issues could emerge with GOCOVRI that could require us to change the prescribing information to add warnings, limit use of the product, and/or result in litigation. Any of these events could have a negative impact on our business.\nDiscovery of unforeseen safety problems or increased focus on a known problem could impact our ability to commercialize GOCOVRI and could result in restrictions on its permissible uses, including withdrawal of the medicine from the market.\nIf we or others identify additional undesirable side effects caused by GOCOVRI after approval:\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, specific warnings, contraindications, or field alerts to physicians and pharmacies;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product and require us to take our approved drugs off the market;\n\u2022we may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials, change the labeling of the product, or implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS;\n\u2022we may have limitations on how we promote our drugs;\n\u2022third-party payers may limit coverage or reimbursement for GOCOVRI;\n\u2022sales of GOCOVRI may decrease significantly;\n\u2022we may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n\u2022our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of GOCOVRI and could substantially increase our commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenue from its sale.\nFurther, GOCOVRI may also be affected by the safety and tolerability of its parent drug or drugs with similar mechanisms of action. Although amantadine, which is a component of GOCOVRI, has been used in patients for many years, problems identified with other approved amantadine products or amantadine products being studied in clinical trials could result in increased regulatory scrutiny of our products and/or adversely affect the commercialization of GOCOVRI.\nIf a safety issue emerges post-approval, we may become subject to costly product liability litigation by our customers, their patients or payers. Product liability claims could divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend, and result in sizable damage awards against us that may not be covered by insurance. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that GOCOVRI caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities.\nWe currently hold $15.0 million in product liability insurance coverage, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to obtain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in amounts adequate to satisfy any liability or associated costs that may arise in the future. These events could harm our business and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.\nIf manufacturers obtain approval for generic versions of GOCOVRI, or of products with which we compete, our business may suffer.\nUnder the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the FDA can approve an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, for a generic version of a branded drug without the ANDA applicant undertaking the clinical testing necessary to obtain approval to market a new drug. Generally, in place of such clinical studies, an ANDA applicant usually needs only to submit data demonstrating that its product has the same active ingredient(s), strength, dosage form, route of administration and that it is bioequivalent to the branded product. We have recently settled an ANDA litigation with a generic filer. See Litigation and Other Legal Proceedings in \u201cNote 9 - Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the accompanying \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in this Annual Report for more information. However, other filers could submit an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market another generic version of GOCOVRI, which could result in our expending significant time and incurring significant expenses in challenging the submissions. Further, if one or more of these filers is successful, the introduction of a generic version of GOCOVRI could harm our business and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.\nThe marketing and promotion of GOCOVRI must be limited to the approved indication for use and the information and clinical data included in or consistent with the approved prescribing information. If we want to expand the marketing and promotion of GOCOVRI beyond the approved indication or with information not consistent with the approved prescribing information, we will need to obtain additional regulatory approvals, which may not be granted.\nWith the August 2017 approval of GOCOVRI for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy, with or without concomitant dopaminergic medications, we currently are permitted to market or promote it, consistent with the information and data in its approved prescribing information, only for the treatment of dyskinesia and not for other uses. We are developing ADS-5102, the formulation in GOCOVRI for at least one additional indication, treatment of walking impairment in patients with multiple sclerosis. To market and promote GOCOVRI for this additional indication, we may need to conduct an additional clinical trial to obtain regulatory approval for such use that will likely be time-consuming and expensive. Our current marketing and promotional efforts is limited to the use of information included in or deemed to be consistent with the approved prescribing information for GOCOVRI for the treatment of dyskinesia, including the clinical data and results reflected in the prescribing information.\nIf we are found to have improperly promoted GOCOVRI, or if physicians misuse it, we may be subject to restrictions on the sale or marketing of GOCOVRI and significant fines, penalties, sanctions and product liability claims, and our image and reputation within the industry and marketplace could be harmed.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies, including regulatory authorities outside the United States, strictly regulate the marketing and promotional claims that are made about drug products, such as GOCOVRI. In particular, promotion of a product must be consistent with its labeling approved by the FDA or by regulatory agencies in other countries. For example, in the case of GOCOVRI, for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy, with or without concomitant dopaminergic medications, we cannot prevent physicians from prescribing GOCOVRI for indications or uses that are inconsistent with the approved label. If, however, we are found to have promoted such unapproved uses prior to the FDA\u2019s approval for an additional indication, we may, among other consequences, receive untitled or warning letters and become subject to significant liability, which would materially harm our business. Both the U.S. federal government and foreign regulatory authorities have levied significant civil and criminal fines against companies and individuals for alleged improper promotion and have entered into settlement agreements with pharmaceutical companies to limit inappropriate promotional activities. If we become the target of such an investigation or prosecution based on our marketing and promotional practices, we could face similar sanctions, which would materially harm our business. In addition, management\u2019s attention could be diverted from our business operations, significant legal expenses could be incurred, and our reputation could be damaged.\nPhysicians prescribing of our products for unapproved uses may also subject us to product liability claims, to the extent such uses lead to adverse events, side effects, or injury.\nIf we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program or other governmental pricing programs in the United States, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, fines, sanctions and exposure under other laws which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, as administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, and other federal and state government pricing programs in the United States, and we may participate in additional government pricing programs in the future. These programs generally require us to pay rebates or otherwise provide discounts to government payers in connection with drugs that are dispensed to beneficiaries/recipients of these programs. Pricing requirements and rebate/discount calculations are complex, vary among products and programs, and are often subject to interpretation by governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. Thus, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify all factors that may cause our discount and rebate payment obligations to vary from period to period, and our actual results may differ significantly from our estimated allowances for discounts and rebates. Changes in estimates and assumptions may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services and other Congressional enforcement and administrative bodies have increased their focus on pricing requirements for products,\nincluding, but not limited to the methodologies used by manufacturers to calculate average manufacturer price, or AMP, and best price, or BP, for compliance with reporting requirements under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. We are liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data and for any overcharging of government payers. For example, failure to submit monthly/quarterly AMP and BP data on a timely basis could result in significant civil monetary penalties for each day the submission is late beyond the due date. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify overpayments could result in allegations against us under the Federal False Claims Act and other laws and regulations. Any required refunds to the U.S. government or responding to a government investigation or enforcement action would be expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in the event that CMS were to terminate our rebate agreement, no federal payments would be available under Medicaid or Medicare for our covered outpatient drugs.\nGOCOVRI is complex to manufacture, and manufacturing disruptions may occur that could cause us to experience disruptions in the supply of GOCOVRI.\nGOCOVRI is a high-dose, extended release amantadine taken once-daily at bedtime that delivers high levels of amantadine in the morning upon waking and throughout the day. The manufacture of extended release versions of drugs is more complex than the manufacture of the immediate release versions of drugs. Notwithstanding the fact that we have validated our process, manufacturing disruptions may occur. Such problems may prevent the production of lots that meet the specifications required for sale of the product and may be difficult and expensive to resolve. If any such issues were to arise with respect to GOCOVRI, our business, financial results, or stock price could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to maintain orphan exclusivity for GOCOVRI for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy, with or without concomitant dopaminergic medications, our business may be substantially harmed.\nWhen GOCOVRI was approved for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy, with or without concomitant dopaminergic medications, GOCOVRI earned seven years of orphan drug exclusivity under the Orphan Drug Act. Even so, the FDA could still subsequently approve the same drug with the same active moiety for the same indication if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer or more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care, or if we are unable to assure that sufficient quantities of medicine are available to meet patient needs. If we are unable to maintain orphan drug exclusivity for GOCOVRI for the treatment of dyskinesia, our business would be substantially harmed.\nRisks related to ADS-5102 in clinical development and any other product candidates\nOur ability to benefit from our investment in ADS-5102 for the treatment of walking impairment in patients with multiple sclerosis depends on the timely clinical development, approval and successful commercialization of ADS-5102 for this indication.\nWe have invested significant effort and financial resources into the development and potential commercialization of ADS-5102 for the treatment of walking impairment in patients with multiple sclerosis. Our ability to generate product revenue from this product in development will depend heavily on the successful development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of ADS-5102 for this indication. The success of ADS-5102 for the treatment of walking impairment in patients with multiple sclerosis will depend on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022successfully engaging with the FDA and developing a regulatory pathway for ADS-5102 based on data from the INROADS trial;\n\u2022successfully completing the development program in a timely manner;\n\u2022receiving marketing approval from the FDA in a timely manner;\n\u2022successfully establishing and maintaining commercial manufacturing with third parties;\n\u2022commercializing our products, if approved, including marketing, sales, and distribution of the product independently or in partnership with another company;\n\u2022acceptance by the medical community and patients of the approved product;\n\u2022coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payers;\n\u2022willingness and ability of patients to pay out of pocket for the products;\n\u2022effectively competing with other approved or used medicines and future compounds in development;\n\u2022continued demonstration of an acceptable safety profile following approval; and\n\u2022obtaining, maintaining, enforcing, and defending intellectual property rights and claims.\nIf we do not achieve these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize ADS-5102 for the treatment of walking impairment in patients with multiple sclerosis, which would cause us not to realize on our investment in ADS-5102 for this indication. In addition, if we determine to pursue development of ADS-5102 for additional indications other than for the treatment of walking impairment in patients with multiple sclerosis, we will face many of these factors for those additional indications.\nWe will face risks in the development of ADS-5102 for additional indications.\nThere are risks associated with pursuing clinical trials in other indications for ADS-5102, including for the treatment of walking impairment in patients with multiple sclerosis, as we may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result, of clinical studies that could harm our ability to commercialize such products or to receive regulatory approval, including that:\n\u2022clinical studies may produce negative or inconclusive results or raise significant safety concerns, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical studies or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022even if clinical studies demonstrate statistically significant efficacy and acceptable safety, the FDA or similar authorities outside the United States may not consider the results of our studies to be sufficient for approval;\n\u2022our clinical sites and clinical investigators may fail to comply with, or inconsistently apply, the trial protocols, regulatory requirements including Good Clinical Practices, contractual obligations, and the rating assessments;\n\u2022our third-party vendors, including our Contract Research Organizations, or CROs, and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022we might have to suspend or terminate clinical studies for various reasons, including a finding that our products have unanticipated serious side effects or other unexpected characteristics or that the patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022regulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022the supply or quality of ADS-5102 or other materials necessary to conduct clinical studies may be insufficient or inadequate; and\n\u2022our new product discovery or research program may not be successful or warrant clinical development.\nIf we are forced to delay or abandon development of our products, our business, results of operations, and financial condition will be materially and adversely harmed.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product or indication and fail to capitalize on products or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we have chosen to focus on research programs and products for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with our product candidate or other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our investment in current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products for us or future partners.\nIf we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing, or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights.\nFailure to gain approval of or successfully commercialize ADS-5102 in additional indications in the United States could substantially harm our business.\nWe will face the same or similar challenges in obtaining FDA approval and in commercialization and manufacturing ADS-5102 as GOCOVRI, as outlined above, including but not limited to market acceptance by physicians and patients, coverage and reimbursement by third party payers, and manufacturing issues.\nIf we resume development of ADS-4101, or seek to develop additional product candidates that we may develop or acquire, we will face the same regulatory and development risks that we face with the development of ADS-5102 for the treatment of walking impairment in patients with multiple sclerosis.\nAlthough we have placed the development program for ADS-4101 (lacosamide) modified release capsules for the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy on hold, if we determine to resume development of ADS-4101, or develop or acquire other potential product candidates and seek to develop them, we will face the same regulatory and other development risks that we face with the development of ADS-5102 for the treatment of walking impairment in patients with multiple sclerosis discussed above.\nWe may in the future seek to acquire additional product candidates, which may subject us to additional risks and expense.\nIn the future in seeking to diversify our product candidate portfolio we may seek to identify and acquire or in-license novel product candidates. We may fail to identify and acquire or in-license product candidates, including for reasons discussed in these risk factors, and also:\n\u2022the process by which we identify and decide to acquire product candidates may not be successful;\n\u2022the competition to acquire or in-license promising product candidates is fierce and many of our competitors are large, multinational pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies with considerably more financial, development and commercialization resources and experience than we have;\n\u2022potential product candidates may, upon further study during or after the acquisition process, fail to demonstrate clinical efficacy, be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be products that will receive marketing approval or achieve market acceptance; and\n\u2022potential product candidates may not be effective in treating their targeted diseases.\nIn addition, if we do acquire additional product candidates and they prove to be unsuccessful, we will have spent significant amounts of resources in acquiring and pursuing these product candidates, and not receive any return on our investments. Further, time and resources spent searching for, identifying, acquiring, and developing potential product candidates may distract management\u2019s attention from our existing business.\nRisks related to our reliance on third parties\nWe rely on third-party organizations to manufacture, supply, and distribute GOCOVRI and ADS-5102. If one of these organizations fails to perform adequately or fulfill our needs, we may be required to incur significant costs and devote significant efforts to find new third party vendors and/or face delays in the commercialization and supply of ADS-5102.\nWe do not own facilities for clinical and commercial manufacturing of GOCOVRI or ADS-5102, and we rely upon third-party contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture, serialize and supply drug product for our clinical studies and to meet commercial demand. If our manufacturers were to encounter difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of GOCOVRI or ADS-5102 and quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, or fail to comply with strictly enforced cGMP requirements, other federal and state regulatory requirements, our commercial supply of GOCOVRI or ADS-5102 in our clinical trials could be jeopardized. We have little control over our manufacturers\u2019 operations or their compliance with applicable regulations and standards. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical study materials or commercial product could cause delays in our clinical programs, harm our ability to gain approval from regulatory authorities, and potentially disrupt patient access to our approved products. These events would substantially harm our business, reputation and stock price.\nWe also rely on a single specialty pharmacy to distribute and provide access to GOCOVRI for the vast majority of our patients. Accordingly, this specialty pharmacy is the Company\u2019s largest customer representing approximately 98% of the Company\u2019s product revenue. If this specialty pharmacy fails to perform, it could materially harm our business.\nAll third-party manufacturers of our products and ingredients thereof must comply with cGMP requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance, and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our products may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with other FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements. The FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies may also implement new standards at any time, or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing standards for manufacture, packaging, or testing of products. We have little control over our manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards. A failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety of any product supplied is compromised due to our manufacturers\u2019 failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our products and we may be held liable for any injuries sustained as a result. Any of these factors could cause a delay of clinical studies, regulatory submissions, approvals, commercialization or supply of our products, entail higher costs, impair our reputation, and potentially disrupt patient access or our approved products.\nWe rely on a single source third-party contract manufacturing organization for the manufacture and supply of our drug substances and drug product for GOCOVRI and ADS-5102.\nAlthough we have supply agreements with two drug substance suppliers, only one is currently manufacturing at commercial scales required for GOCOVRI. In addition, we also currently rely on a single drug product manufacturer for GOCOVRI and ADS-5102. We continue to seek additional long-term supply agreements with suppliers and supplier qualifications. A failure of our single source manufacturer or drug substance supplier or our failure to qualify at least one other manufacturer organization on a timely basis and validate the manufacturing process employed at that manufacturer or supplier could delay or harm commercialization of GOCOVRI or ADS-5102. Although we believe alternative sources of supply exist, the number of third-party suppliers with the necessary manufacturing and regulatory expertise and facilities is limited, and it could be expensive and take a significant amount of time to arrange and negotiate acceptable long-term contracts and obtain regulatory approvals and qualifications, which would adversely affect our business. New suppliers of any drug substance would be required to be qualified under applicable regulatory requirements and would need to have sufficient rights under applicable intellectual property laws to the method of manufacturing the product. Obtaining the necessary FDA approvals or other qualifications under applicable regulatory requirements and ensuring non-infringement of third-party intellectual property rights could result in a significant interruption of supply and could require the new manufacturer to bear significant additional costs, which may be passed on to us. Qualifying and negotiating long-term contracts with manufacturers and providers of packaging services is a lengthy process. If at any time, one or more of our qualified contract manufacturing organizations were not able to manufacture our drug substance\nor drug product or provide the requisite services, our business and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of these trials.\nWe do not independently conduct clinical studies of our products. Instead, we rely on third parties, such as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions, and clinical investigators to perform this function. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities, but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practice, for conducting, recording, and reporting the results of clinical studies to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity, and confidentiality of patients in clinical studies are protected, even though we are not in control of these processes. These third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines, or conduct our clinical studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, regulatory approvals for our products and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our products.\nWe also rely on other third parties to store and distribute supplies for our clinical studies. Any performance failure on the part of our existing or future distributors could delay clinical development or regulatory approval of our products or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nRisks related to government regulation\nChanges in healthcare law and implementing regulations, including government restrictions on pricing and reimbursement, as well as healthcare policy and other healthcare payer cost-containment initiatives and current societal pressures regarding pharmaceutical product pricing, may negatively impact our ability to generate revenues from or could limit or prevent our products\u2019 commercial success.\nIn the United States, there have been and we expect there will continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future revenue and profitability and the future revenue and profitability of our potential customers. Federal and state lawmakers regularly propose and, at times, enact legislation that would result in significant changes to the healthcare system, some of which are intended to contain or reduce the costs of medical products and services. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cPPACA\u201d) was passed, which has substantially changed how healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and has significantly impacted the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. Details of healthcare regulations, including changes under the PPACA, are discussed in the business heading \u201cOther healthcare regulations\u201d in Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe expect that the PPACA, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of our existing products.\nThe continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations, other payers of healthcare services, and patient and political groups to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may, among other things, adversely affect:\n\u2022our ability to set a price we believe is fair for our products;\n\u2022the reputation of our company;\n\u2022our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability; and\n\u2022the availability of capital.\nOur ability to commercialize our products successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our\nproducts, will depend in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including, in the United States, governmental payers such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations and private health insurers. Details of these considerations are discussed in the business heading \u201cOther healthcare regulations\u201d in Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense and subject us to penalties if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements.\nThe manufacturing, marketing, and further development of GOCOVRI are subject to continual review by the FDA and/or analogous non-U.S. regulatory authorities. In addition, we are and will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements with regard to the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, distribution, advertising, promotion, tracking, recordkeeping, and periodic reporting for our products. Further, we and our contract manufacturers of our drug products are required to comply with cGMP regulations, which include requirements related to quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Regulatory authorities must approve manufacturing facilities before they can be used to manufacture our drug products, and these facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations. Certain changes to the manufacturing processes would also be subject to pre-approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, if we or a third party discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions on that product, its manufacturer, or us, including but not limited to requiring withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. If we, our products or the manufacturing facilities for our products fail to comply with regulatory requirements of the FDA and/or applicable non-U.S. regulatory authorities, we could be subject to administrative or other sanctions, including:\n\u2022warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022civil or criminal penalties and fines;\n\u2022injunctions;\n\u2022suspension, variation, or withdrawal of regulatory approval;\n\u2022suspension of ongoing clinical studies;\n\u2022voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u2022requirements for dissemination of corrective information or modifications to promotional materials;\n\u2022refusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved applications filed by us;\n\u2022refusal to permit import or export of our products;\n\u2022restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022seizure or detention of our products.\nRegulatory requirements and policies may change, and we may need to comply with additional laws and regulations that are enacted. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or in other countries. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market, or continue to market, our future products and our business may suffer.\nIf we fail to comply with healthcare regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nHealthcare providers, physicians, distributors, and third-party payers play a primary role in the distribution, recommendation, and prescription of any pharmaceutical product for which we obtain marketing approval. Our\narrangements with third-party payers and customers expose us to broadly applicable federal and state fraud and abuse and other laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements through which we market, sell and distribute GOCOVRI and other products for which we may obtain marketing approval. The laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, lease, arrangement or recommendation of, any good, facility, item, or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Liability under the Anti-Kickback Statute may be established without a person or entity having actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act;\n\u2022the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibits individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment of government funds, or knowingly using false records or statements, to obtain payment from the federal government. In recent years, several pharmaceutical and other health care companies have faced enforcement actions under the False Claims Act for, among other things, allegedly submitting false or misleading pricing information to government healthcare programs, providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs, product and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement services, and marketing products for off-label or unapproved uses;\n\u2022the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payer (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items, or services relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which impose obligations on HIPAA covered entities and their business associates, including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to maintain the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the federal government information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and\n\u2022analogous state laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback, and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers. Several states also require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products in those states and to report gifts and payments to individual health care providers in those states. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing-relating activities, including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers. Some states require pricing reporting with respect to certain drug products. Certain state and localities also require the\nregistration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. In addition, several states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs, imprisonment, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Any action against us for violation of these or other laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security, and fraud laws may prove costly. In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. Moreover, the requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country.\nHealth Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures, and most European Union member states now have an HTA system. The HTA process in the European Union member states is governed by the national laws of these countries. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of the use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the national healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market.\nThe outcome of HTA may influence the pricing and reimbursement status for specific medicinal products within individual European Union member states. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of a specific medicinal product vary between the European Union member states.\nIn 2011, Directive 2011/24/EU was adopted at European Union level. This Directive concerns the application of patients\u2019 rights in cross-border healthcare. The Directive is intended to establish rules for facilitating access to safe and high-quality cross-border healthcare in the European Union. Pursuant to Directive 2011/24/EU, a voluntary network of national authorities or bodies responsible for HTA in the individual EU member states was established. The purpose of the network is to facilitate and support the cooperation between national authorities or bodies and the exchange of information concerning HTAs. This could lead to greater harmonization between European Union member states of the criteria taken into account in the conduct of HTA in pricing and reimbursement decisions.\nIf we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program or other governmental pricing programs that we may join if we successfully commercialize any of our product candidates, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe participate in and have certain price reporting obligations to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program and other governmental pricing programs.\nUnder the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, a manufacturer is required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for its covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates are based on pricing data reported by the manufacturer on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. These data include the average manufacturer price and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any entity in the United States in any pricing structure, calculated to include all sales and associated rebates, discounts and other price concessions.\nThe PPACA made significant changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, as discussed under the heading \u201cOther healthcare regulations\u201d in Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. On February 1, 2016, CMS issued\nfinal regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under the PPACA. These regulations became effective on April 1, 2016. The issuance of regulations and coverage expansion by various governmental agencies relating to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program may increase our costs and the complexity of compliance and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if we participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program if and when we successfully commercialize any of our product candidates.\nFederal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also participate in the Public Health Service\u2019s 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer\u2019s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge no more than the 340B \u201cceiling price\u201d for the manufacturer\u2019s covered outpatient drugs to a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The PPACA expanded the list of covered entities to include certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, but exempts \u201corphan drugs\u201d from the ceiling price requirements for these covered entities. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. Changes to the definition of average manufacturer price and the Medicaid rebate amount under the Healthcare Reform Act and CMS\u2019s final regulations implementing those changes also could affect the 340B ceiling price calculations for any of our product candidates that we successfully commercialize and could negatively impact our results of operations.\nThe PPACA obligates the Secretary of the HHS to update the agreement that manufacturers must sign to participate in the 340B program to obligate a manufacturer to offer the 340B price to covered entities if the manufacturer makes the drug available to any other purchaser at any price and to report to the government the ceiling prices for its drugs. The Health Resources and Services Administration, or HRSA, recently initiated the process of updating the agreement with participating manufacturers. The PPACA also obligates the Secretary of the HHS to create regulations and processes to improve the integrity of the 340B program. After implementation delays directed by the Trump Administration, on November 30, 2018, HRSA published its final rule regarding the calculation of 340B ceiling price and imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers for knowingly and intentionally overcharging covered entities, which became effective on January 1, 2019. The issuance of any other final regulations and guidance could affect our obligations under the 340B program in ways we cannot anticipate, if and when we successfully commercialize any of our product candidates and if we participate in the 340B program. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in an inpatient setting.\nPricing and rebate calculations vary across products and programs, are complex, and are often subject to interpretation by the reporting manufacturer, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. In the case of Medicaid pricing data, if we join the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we will be obligated to resubmit the corrected data for up to three years after those data originally were due. Such restatements and recalculations would increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate program and could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters. Price recalculations also may affect the ceiling price at which we would be required to offer any of our product candidates that we successfully commercialize under the 340B drug discount program.\nWe will be liable for errors associated with any submission of pricing data. In addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B program refunds, if we are found to have knowingly submitted any false price information to the government, we may be liable for significant civil monetary penalties per item of false information. Our failure to submit the required price data on a timely basis could result in significant civil monetary penalties for each day the information is late beyond the due date. Such failure also could be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we will participate in the Medicaid program if we join the program if and when we successfully commercialize any of our product candidates. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreement, federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for any of our product candidates that we successfully commercialize.\nCMS and the OIG have pursued manufacturers that were alleged to have failed to report these data to the government in a timely manner. Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid. We cannot assure you that our submissions, if we participate in the federal programs if and when we successfully commercialize any of our product candidates, will not be found by CMS to be incomplete or incorrect.\nIn order to be eligible to have any of our product candidates that we successfully commercialize paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by the Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, Department of Defense, Public Health Service, and Coast Guard, referred to collectively as the Big Four agencies, and certain federal grantees, we are required to participate in the VA Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program, established under Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. Under this program, we are obligated to make any of our product candidates that we successfully commercialize that meet the statutory definition of \u201ccovered drug\u201d (biologics and single and innovator multiple source drugs) available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to the Big Four agencies that is no higher than the Federal Ceiling Price, or FCP, which is a price calculated pursuant to a statutory formula. The FCP is derived from a calculated price point called the \u201cnon-federal average manufacturer price,\u201d or Non-FAMP, which we will be required to calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. Pursuant to applicable law, knowing provision of false information in connection with a Non-FAMP filing can subject a manufacturer to significant penalties for each item of false information. The FSS contract also contains extensive disclosure and certification requirements.\nUnder Section 703 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2008, we will be required to pay quarterly rebates on utilization of innovator products that are dispensed through the Tricare network pharmacies to Tricare beneficiaries. The rebates are calculated as the difference between the annual Non-FAMP and FCP. If we overcharge the government in connection with the FSS contract or Tricare Retail Pharmacy Rebate Program, whether due to a misstated FCP or otherwise, we are required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against us under the False Claims Act and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and any response to government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects if we successfully commercialize any of our product candidates.\nIf we fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations, we could be subject to government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation, increased compliance costs and/or adverse publicity, which could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nWe are subject to data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security). In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us, including civil and/or criminal penalties, private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results and business. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (e.g., healthcare providers who prescribe our products) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA, as amended by HITECH. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA-other than potentially with respect to providing certain employee benefits-we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. HIPAA generally requires that healthcare providers and other covered entities obtain written authorizations from patients prior to disclosing protected health information of the patient (unless an exception to the authorization requirement applies). If authorization is required and the patient fails to execute an authorization or the authorization fails to contain all required provisions, then we may not be allowed access to and use of the patient\u2019s information and our research efforts could be delayed. Furthermore, use of protected health information that is provided to us pursuant to a valid patient authorization is subject to the limits set forth in the authorization (e.g., for use in research and in submissions to regulatory authorities for product approvals). In addition, HIPAA does not replace federal, state, international or other laws that may grant individuals even greater privacy protections.\nOn June 28, 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent state privacy legislation in the U.S., which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.\nIn the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect on May 25, 2018, introducing sweeping new data protection requirements that carry potential fines of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of annual global revenue. The GDPR will increase our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data that we process, expose us to substantial potential fines in the event of violations, increase our compliance costs and could restrict our operations in Europe.\nThe regulatory approval process is expensive, time consuming, and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates.\nThe research, development, manufacturing, quality control, labeling, approval, safety, effectiveness, storage, record keeping, reporting, selling, import, export, advertising, promotion, marketing, and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States, and by regulatory authorities in other countries, with different regulations from country to country. We are not permitted to market our products in the United States or other countries until we receive regulatory approvals. In August 2017, GOCOVRI was FDA-approved for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy, with or without concomitant dopaminergic medications. The FDA will need to approve supplemental NDAs for GOCOVRI before we can market the drug for other indications, such as multiple sclerosis walking impairment.\nTo receive approval to commercialize any of our product candidates in the United States, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence from adequate and well-controlled clinical studies, and to the satisfaction of the FDA, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. Results from preclinical studies and clinical studies can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe the preclinical or clinical data for our product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA. Administering any of our product candidates to humans may produce undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay, or cause suspension of clinical studies of our product candidates and result in the denial of approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications.\nFDA approval of an NDA is not guaranteed, and the approval process is expensive and may take several years. The FDA also has substantial discretion in the approval process. Despite the time and expense we invest, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that require us to repeat clinical studies, perform additional preclinical studies and clinical studies, or abandon development and commercialization of a product candidate altogether. The number of preclinical studies and clinical studies that will be required for FDA approval varies depending on, among other factors, the product candidate, the disease or condition that the product candidate is designed to address, and the regulations applicable to any particular product candidate. The FDA can delay, limit, or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022disagreement with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022failure of clinical trials to show the level of statistical significance or clinical meaningfulness needed for approval;\n\u2022failure to demonstrate that a product candidate is safe or effective;\n\u2022insufficient data from preclinical and clinical studies to support an application;\n\u2022a finding by an institutional review board, or IRB, Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, Data Monitoring Committee, or DMC, or the FDA that the clinical trial exposes subjects or patients to an unacceptable health risk;\n\u2022disapproval of our or our third-party manufacturer\u2019s processes or facilities; or\n\u2022changes to FDA\u2019s approval policies or regulations.\nIf any of our product candidates fails to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical studies or does not gain regulatory approval, our business and results of operations will be materially and adversely harmed.\nIf the requirements for approval of ADS-5102 under Section 505(b)(2) are not as we expect, approval will likely take significantly longer, cost significantly more, and entail significantly greater complications and risks than anticipated, and in any case may not be successful. Similar obstacles may arise in other countries.\nSimilar to the approval pathway for GOCOVRI, we are developing ADS-5102, with the expectation that it will be eligible for approval through the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA allows an NDA to rely in part on the FDA\u2019s prior conclusions regarding the safety and effectiveness of an approved drug product, or reference listed drug, or RLD. Use of the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway could potentially decrease the amount of preclinical and/or clinical data that we would need to generate in order to obtain FDA approval. If the FDA does not allow us to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway as anticipated, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials, provide additional data and information, and meet additional standards for product approval. If this were to occur, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval, and the complications and risks associated with regulatory approval would likely substantially increase. Moreover, our inability to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway may result in competitive products reaching the market more quickly, which would adversely impact our competitive position and prospects. Even if we are able to utilize the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, there is no guarantee that utilizing this pathway will ultimately lead to faster product development or earlier approval for any product that we may attempt to develop and commercialize.\nRisks related to intellectual property\nOur ability to successfully commercialize GOCOVRI, ADS-5102, and any product candidates may be materially adversely affected if we are unable to obtain and maintain effective intellectual property rights for our products and product candidates.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain exclusivity, patent(s), and other intellectual property protection in the United States and in other countries with respect to GOCOVRI, ADS-5102, our product candidates, and any in- and out-licensed programs. We have sought to protect GOCOVRI, ADS-5102, and our product candidate(s) by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel discoveries, technologies, and products that are important to our business. This process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. In addition, we may not pursue or obtain patent protection in all relevant markets. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part. In addition, our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our discoveries or technologies or from developing competing products and technologies.\nThe patent position of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which many legal principles remain unresolved. In recent years, patent rights have been the subject of significant litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability, and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued in the United States or in other jurisdictions which protect our technology or products or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. In addition, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, might require that the term of a patent issuing from\na pending patent application be disclaimed and limited to the term of another patent that is commonly owned or names a common inventor. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability, and commercial value of our patent rights is highly uncertain.\nThe United States has enacted and implemented wide-ranging patent reform legislation. The United States Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on actions by the United States Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents that we have licensed or that we might obtain in the future. Similarly, changes in patent law and regulations in other countries or jurisdictions or changes in the governmental bodies that enforce them or changes in how the relevant governmental authority enforces patent laws or regulations may weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents that we have licensed or that we may obtain in the future.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in opposition, interference, derivation, inter partes review, post-grant review, or other proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others, and the outcome of any proceedings are highly uncertain. An adverse determination in any such proceeding could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us or Allergan, without payment to us.\nEven if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us, or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its scope, validity, or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in the patent claims of our owned or licensed patents being narrowed, invalidated, or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop or prevent us from stopping others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing, and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours or otherwise provide us with a competitive advantage.\nFor our partnered assets, like Namzaric, we may not have the right to control the prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain or enforce the patent, covering our products or product candidates that we license to third parties or that we may license from third parties. Therefore, we cannot be certain that these patents and applications will be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. In addition, if third parties who license patents to us or from us fail to maintain such patents, or lose rights to those patents, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting, and defending patents on all of our products and product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but where enforcement is not as strong as in the United States. These products may compete with our products and product candidates in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents, and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products against third parties in violation of our proprietary rights generally. The initiation of proceedings by third parties to enforce our patent\nrights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends upon compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment, and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment, and other provisions during the patent prosecution process and following the issuance of a patent. Our failure to comply with such requirements could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction.In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case if our patent were in force.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits or other proceedings to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming, and if unsuccessful could materially harm our business.\nCompetitors may infringe or otherwise violate our patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property for GOCOVRI and ADS-5102, our partnered products, any product candidates, and any in- and out-licensed programs. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we or our licensees may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. For example, on February 16, 2018, Osmotica Pharmaceuticals LLC and Vertical Pharmaceuticals LLC (\u201cOsmotica\u201d) filed an action against us in U.S. District Court for the state of Delaware, requesting a declaratory judgment that Osmotica\u2019s newly-approved product Osmolex ER\u2122 (amantadine) extended release tablets does not infringe certain of our patents. For further information, see Litigation and Other Legal Proceedings in \u201cNote 9 - Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the accompanying \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in this Annual Report.\nWe anticipate that the prosecution of any lawsuits related to our partnered products and any lawsuits related to GOCOVRI may require a significant amount of time and attention from our senior executives and management. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours (or a patent we license) is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the product in question. An adverse result in any litigations or proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Such a result could limit our ability to prevent others from using or commercializing similar or identical products, limit our ability to prevent others from launching generic versions of our products and could limit the duration of patent protection for our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Also, a successful challenge to our patents could reduce or eliminate our right to receive royalties from Allergan under our license agreement with Allergan. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we or our partners are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our partners to develop, manufacture, market, and sell our products and product candidates and to use our proprietary discoveries and technologies without infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating the proprietary rights or intellectual property of third parties. We or our partners may become party to, or be threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference, derivation, re-examination, inter partes review, post-grant review, opposition, or similar proceedings before the USPTO and its foreign counterparts. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and the proceedings may result in a loss of such intellectual property rights. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent disputes and litigation more effectively than we can, because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any disputes or litigation could adversely affect our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us or our partners based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. Under our license agreement with Allergan we are obliged to indemnify Allergan under certain circumstances and our royalty entitlements may also be reduced. Our\nindemnification obligation to Allergan, while subject to customary limitations, has no monetary cap, and our right to receive royalties from Allergan may be eliminated in any calendar quarter in which certain third party generic competition exists. If we or our partners are found to infringe a third-party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third-party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our products and product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe may be unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, thus harming our business and competitive position.\nIn addition to our patented technology and products, we rely upon trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology, and other proprietary information, to develop and maintain our competitive position, which we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, our partners, and consultants. We also have agreements with our employees and selected consultants that obligate them to assign their inventions to us. However, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute such agreements, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. In addition, it is possible that technology relevant to our business will be independently developed by a person that is not a party to such an agreement.\nWhile to our knowledge the confidentiality of our trade secrets has not been compromised, if the employees, consultants or partners that are parties to these agreements breach or violate the terms of these agreements, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or violation, and we could lose our trade secrets through such breaches or violations. Further, our trade secrets could be disclosed, misappropriated, or otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors. In addition, intellectual property laws in foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If our trade secrets are disclosed or misappropriated, it would harm our ability to protect our rights and adversely affect our business.\nRisks related to Namzaric\u00ae\nUnder our license agreement with Allergan, if Allergan fails to successfully commercialize Namzaric for any reason or if the license agreement with Allergan is terminated, the potential royalties we are eligible to receive under our license agreement with Allergan may not occur or may be minimal, and would have a negative impact on our revenue potential and harm our business.\nIn November 2012, we entered into a license agreement with Allergan pursuant to which we granted Allergan a right to develop and commercialize Namzaric in the United States. Under that agreement, we expect to receive future royalties from Allergan on the net sales of Namzaric, starting in May 2020. If for any reason Allergan fails to successfully commercialize Namzaric, on which we are eligible to receive royalties in the low double digits to mid-teens, we may not receive such future royalties or receive minimal amounts, and our business may be harmed. Even if we do receive royalties, based on 2019 net sales of Namzaric, we expect the tiered royalty to be in the low double digits through the term of the agreement.\nWe are the subject of litigation claiming violation of Federal and state false claims acts in connection with the commercialization of Namenda XR and Namzaric by Allergan, which may have a material and negative impact on our business.\nOn April 1, 2019, we were served with a complaint against us and several Allergan entities alleging violations of Federal and state false claims acts (\u201cFCA\u201d) in connection with the commercialization of Namenda XR and Namzaric by Allergan, as further described in Litigation and Other Legal Proceedings in \u201cNote 9 - Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the accompanying \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in this Annual Report. The complaint alleges that patents held by Allergan and us covering Namenda XR and Namzaric were procured through fraud on the\nUnited States Patent and Trademark Office and that these patents were asserted against potential generic manufacturers of Namenda XR and Namzaric to prevent the generic manufacturers from entering the market, thereby wrongfully excluding generic competition resulting in artificially high price being charged to government payors. The complaint includes a claim for damages of \u201cpotentially more than $2.5 billion dollars,\u201d treble damages and statutory penalties. We are in the early stages of this litigation. Defending this litigation may be costly, divert time and attention of our management from the conduct of our business, and if we are unable to prevail in this litigation it may result in substantial damages, each of which could have a material and negative impact on our business.\nRisks related to our financial condition and need for additional capital\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. Any future revenue will depend on our ability to market and sell GOCOVRI, ADS-5102 and our product candidate, the payment of royalties to us from Allergan under terms of our licensing agreement regarding Namzaric, or the establishment of potential future collaboration and license agreements, if any, and the achievement of any upfront or milestone payments provided thereunder. Furthermore, our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of other factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including:\n\u2022the level of demand for our products, which may vary significantly as they are launched and compete for position in the marketplace;\n\u2022pricing and reimbursement policies with respect to GOCOVRI, ADS-5102 and our product candidate, if approved, and the competitive response from existing and potential future therapeutic approaches that compete with our products and product candidate;\n\u2022the cost of manufacturing our products and product candidate, which may vary due to a number of factors, including the terms of our agreements with contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs;\n\u2022the timing, cost, level of investment, and success or failure of research and development activities relating to our products and product candidate, which may change from time to time;\n\u2022expenditures that we may incur to acquire and develop additional product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022the timing and success or failure of clinical studies for competing product candidates, or any other change in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our competitors or partners;\n\u2022the timing and magnitude of upfront and milestone payments under any potential future collaboration and licensing agreements;\n\u2022future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; and\n\u2022changing or volatile U.S., European, and global economic environments.\nThe cumulative effects of these factors could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Investors should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated operating results and/or earnings guidance that we may provide.\nIf we do not have adequate funds to cover all of our development and commercial activities, we may have to raise additional capital or curtail or cease operations.\nWe began to commercialize GOCOVRI for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy, with or without concomitant dopaminergic medications, in January 2018, and it will require substantial funds to continue to commercialize GOCOVRI. In addition, funds are required for the continued operation of our business. We have entered into a Sales Agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC under which we may offer and sell our common stock having aggregate sales proceeds of up to $50 million from time to time through Cowen and Company, LLC as our sales agent. As of December 31, 2019, we have not made any sales under this facility. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $132.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. We believe that our available cash, cash equivalents, and investments will be sufficient to fund our anticipated level of operations for at least the next 12 months, but there can be no assurance that this will be the case.\nWe have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from our license agreement with Allergan, public and private equity offerings, our Royalty-Backed Loan with HealthCare Royalty Partners III, L.P., or HCRP, since 2017 with sales of GOCOVRI, and, to a lesser extent, government grants, venture debt, and benefits from tax credits made available under a federal stimulus program supporting drug development. We anticipate that our cash requirements will be substantial as we:\n\u2022commercialize GOCOVRI, including distribution, marketing, and sales capabilities;\n\u2022manufacture GOCOVRI for commercial use;\n\u2022investigate ADS-5102 in preclinical and clinical trials for the treatment of walking impairment in patients with MS, and potentially other indications;\n\u2022seek regulatory approvals for our products and any product candidates that successfully complete clinical studies;\n\u2022continue the research, development, and manufacture of our current products and product candidate; and\n\u2022seek to discover or in-license additional product candidates.\nIf we do not have adequate funds to support these activities, our business opportunities could be hindered.\nIf we need additional funds to operate our business and if we cannot raise additional capital when needed, or if additional capital is not available to us on favorable terms, our stockholders may be adversely affected or our business may be harmed.\nIf we need additional funds to support our business and additional funding is not available on favorable terms or at all, we may need to delay or reduce the scope of our research and clinical development programs or commercialization efforts. We do not have any committed external source of funds or other support for our development efforts. We expect to finance future cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, royalty financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, asset sales, and other marketing and distribution arrangements. Additional financing may not be available to us when we need it or it may not be available on favorable terms. If we raise additional capital through debt financings, royalty financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to our products and product candidate, technologies, future revenue streams, or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we raise additional capital through equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders\u2019 rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, in addition to the repayment of principal and interest on negotiated terms, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or suspend one or more of our clinical studies or research and development programs or our commercialization efforts.\nWe have outstanding debt backed by two of our principal assets, GOCOVRI and royalties we may receive on Namzaric, and failure by us or our royalty subsidiary to fulfill our obligations under the applicable loan agreements may cause the repayment obligations to accelerate.\nIn May 2017, we, through a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a royalty-backed note arrangement with HCRP, pursuant to which we initially borrowed $35 million and then borrowed an additional $65 million upon FDA approval and FDA\u2019s recognition in the Orange Book of the seven-year orphan drug exclusivity that GOCOVRI earned upon approval in August 2017, for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy, with or without concomitant dopaminergic medications.\nInterest and principal on the loan will be payable from the proceeds of royalty on U.S. net sales of GOCOVRI and up to $15 million of our annual royalties from Allergan on U.S. net sales of Namzaric starting in May 2020. The HCRP notes mature in December 2026, if not earlier repaid.\nWe secured the loan with rights to GOCOVRI (ADS-5102) and rights to certain payment amounts on Namzaric and the loan documents further provide for assignment into our subsidiary holding these rights to any future intellectual property, licenses, assets and agreements with respect to the manufacture, development, supply, distribution, sale and commercialization of GOCOVRI. The loan documents contain customary events of default permitting HCRP to accelerate and require mandatory prepayment of outstanding principal and interest, including: failure to timely pay principal and interest when due and payable; failure to perform specified covenants with respect to maintenance of the collateral and prohibitions on liens with respect to the collateral; limitations on payments of dividends, additional loans, acquisition or merger transactions not in accordance with the arrangement. Upon the occurrence, an event of default under the loan documents, we could be required to prepay the entire loan and, if we are not able to do so, we may lose control over certain rights and payments to GOCOVRI and royalty payments with respect to Namzaric, either of which would seriously harm our business.\nWe are and in the future may be subject to securities litigation, which may be expensive and could divert management attention.\nOur share price is volatile, and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We have become the target of this type of litigation and in May 2019 a putative class action lawsuit alleging violations of the federal securities laws was filed against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers alleging violations of the securities laws by us and certain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with our January 2018 secondary public offering of common stock. In addition, in December 2019, another putative class action lawsuit was filed against us and certain former officers alleging violations of the Securities Act of 1934. For more information, please see Litigation and Other Legal Proceedings in \u201cNote 9 - Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d Lawsuits such as this one can be expensive to defend and could divert our management\u2019s attention from the conduct of our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nRisks related to ownership of our common stock\nOur stock price may be volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has fluctuated in the past and may be volatile in the future. The stock market in general and the market for securities of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may experience losses on their investments in our stock.\nIn addition, the clinical development stage of our operations may make it difficult for investors to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022our success in commercializing GOCOVRI for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease;\n\u2022the availability of reimbursement by third-party payers at acceptable levels, or at all, for GOCOVRI;\n\u2022the success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u2022results of clinical studies of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u2022introductions and announcements of new products and product candidates by us, our commercialization partners, or our competitors, and the timing of these introductions or announcements;\n\u2022actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our or our competitors\u2019 products, product candidates, clinical studies, manufacturing process, or sales and marketing terms;\n\u2022variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be comparable to us;\n\u2022our revenue performance, both in absolute terms and relative to analyst and shareholder expectations;\n\u2022the success of our efforts to acquire or in-license additional products or product candidates;\n\u2022developments concerning our collaborations, including but not limited to those with our sources of manufacturing and our commercialization partners;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u2022developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain patent protection for our current or future products;\n\u2022our ability or inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it;\n\u2022the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022changes in the structure of healthcare reimbursement systems;\n\u2022regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries, especially changes in laws or regulations applicable to our current or future products;\n\u2022market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in revenue forecasts, earnings estimates or changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally;\n\u2022trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u2022general economic, industry, and market conditions; and\n\u2022the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nThese broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Additionally, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and our bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be\nwilling to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. Among others, these provisions include that:\n\u2022our board of directors is divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms, which may delay or prevent a change of our management or a change in control;\n\u2022our board of directors has the right to change the size of our board of directors and to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022our stockholders may not act by written consent or call special stockholders\u2019 meetings; as a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to take certain actions other than at annual stockholders\u2019 meetings or special stockholders\u2019 meetings called by the board of directors or the chairman of the board and chief executive officer;\n\u2022our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022stockholders must provide advance notice and additional disclosures in order to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company; and\n\u2022our board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, and the ability to issue undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nOther Risks\nOur ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $354.4 million and $325.8 million, respectively. The federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire, if not utilized, beginning in 2025, and the state net operating loss carryforward begins expiring in 2028. These net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Under the newly enacted federal income tax law, federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses is limited. It is still uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. It is possible that we have experienced an ownership change limitation. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If an ownership change occurs and our ability to use our net operating loss\ncarryforwards is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and we cannot be certain whether the reduced reporting requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and, as such, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may suffer or be more volatile.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, floods, hurricanes, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Our corporate headquarters is located in California and certain clinical sites for our product candidates, operations of our existing and future partners, and suppliers are or will be located near major earthquake faults and fire zones. The ultimate impact on us, our significant partners, suppliers, and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and fire zones and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown, but our operations and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake, fire, or other natural or manmade disaster.\nAny future operations or business arrangements with entities outside the United States present risks that could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf we obtain approval to commercialize any approved products or utilize CMOs outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business. If any product or product candidates that we may develop are approved for commercialization outside the United States, we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships, including:\n\u2022different regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;\n\u2022reduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022different payer reimbursement regimes, governmental payers or patient self-pay systems and price controls;\n\u2022economic weakness, including inflation or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022difficulties in assuring compliance with foreign corrupt practices laws;\n\u2022compliance with tax, employment, immigration, and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022compliance with privacy laws;\n\u2022production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes or typhoons, floods, and fires.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our CROs, CMOs, or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our business.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our CROs, CMOs, specialty pharmacy, distributors, and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we are not aware of any material system failure, accident, or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs or commercialization efforts. For example, the loss of clinical study data from completed or ongoing clinical studies for any of our products or product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. While we back-up our internal computer systems periodically and store such data off-site or in the cloud, we can offer no assurance that such off-site storage of data will allow us to continue our business without interruptions to our operations, which could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs or commercialization efforts. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our products and product candidates could be delayed.", "PERMNO": 14589, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ADMS"}
