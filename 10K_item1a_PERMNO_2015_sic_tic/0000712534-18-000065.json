RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS\nThere are a number of factors, including those specified below, that may adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s business, financial results or stock price. Additional risks that the Corporation currently does not know about or currently views as immaterial may also impair the Corporation\u2019s business or adversely impact its financial results or stock price.\nINDUSTRY AND CORPORATE RISK FACTORS\n\u2022\nThe Corporation\u2019s business and financial results are significantly affected by general business and economic conditions.\nThe Corporation\u2019s business activities and earnings are affected by general business conditions in the United States and abroad. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, monetary supply, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, and the strength of the United States economy and the state and local economies in which the Corporation operates. The Corporation's offices are primarily located in central and northern Indiana, northeast Illinois and central Ohio. Worsening economic conditions in our market areas could negatively impact the financial condition, results of operations and stock price of the Corporation. For example, a prolonged economic downturn, increases in unemployment, or other events that affect household and/or corporate incomes could result in deterioration of credit quality, an increase in the allowance for loan losses, or reduced demand for loan or fee-based products and services. Changes in the financial performance and condition of the Corporation\u2019s borrowers could negatively affect repayment of those borrowers\u2019 loans. In addition, changes in securities market conditions and monetary fluctuations could adversely affect the availability and terms of funding necessary to meet the Corporation\u2019s liquidity needs.\n\u2022\nChanges in the domestic interest rate environment could reduce the Corporation\u2019s net interest income as well as the valuation of assets and liabilities.\nThe operations of financial institutions, such as the Corporation, are dependent to a large degree on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. An institution\u2019s net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest, which in turn are affected by prevailing economic conditions, by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and by the policies of various regulatory agencies. In addition to affecting profitability, changes in interest rates can impact the valuation of assets and liabilities. For example, rate changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans which in turn affect loss rates on those assets. Also, the demand for interest rate based products and services, including loans and deposit accounts, may decline resulting in the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments. Direct investments, such as U.S. Government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles, including mutual funds, generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions, because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements.\n\u2022\nChanges in the laws, regulations and policies governing banks and financial services companies could alter the Corporation\u2019s business environment and adversely affect operations.\nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its fiscal and monetary policies determine in a large part the Corporation\u2019s cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect the Corporation\u2019s net interest margin. Federal Reserve Board policies can also materially affect the value of financial instruments that the Corporation holds, such as debt securities. The Corporation and the Bank are heavily regulated at the federal and state levels. This regulation is to protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole. Congress and state legislatures and federal and state agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. After the Great Recession, efforts to promote the safety and soundness of financial institutions, financial market stability, the transparency and liquidity of financial markets, and consumer and investor protection resulted in increased regulation in the financial services industry. Regulatory agencies have intensified their examination practices and enforcement of laws and regulations. Compliance with regulations and other supervisory initiatives could increase the Corporation\u2019s expenses and reduce revenues by limiting the types of financial services and products that the Corporation offers and/or increasing the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products. See a description of recent legislation in the \u201cREGULATION AND SUPERVISION OF FIRST MERCHANTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\u201d section of Item 1: Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe banking industry, as well as the broader economy, may be subject to new legislation, regulation, and government policy. At this time, we are not able to predict the legislative and regulatory changes that may result from having a the President of the United States and both Houses of Congress and the White House with majority memberships from the same political party. However, both the President and senior members of the House of Representatives have advocated for significant reduction of banking regulation, including possible amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act. Future legislation, regulation, and government policy could affect the banking industry as a whole, including our business and results of operations, in a way that cannot accurately be predicted. In addition, our financial condition and results of operations also could be adversely affected by changes in the way in which existing statutes and regulations are interpreted or applied by courts and government agencies.\nCertain regulations require the Corporation to maintain certain capital ratios, such as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets. Both the Dodd-Frank Act, which reformed the regulation of financial institutions in a comprehensive manner, and the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, which increase both the amount and quality of capital that financial institutions must hold, impact capital requirements. If the Corporation is unable to satisfy these heightened regulatory capital requirements, due to a decline in the value of the loan portfolio or otherwise, raising additional capital or disposing of assets could be required. Additional capital could be raised by selling additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, which could significantly dilute the ownership percentages of stockholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Events or circumstances in the capital markets generally may increase capital costs and impair the ability to raise capital at any given time. Disposal of assets cannot guarantee disposal at prices appropriate for the disposition, and future operating results could be negatively affected.\nPART I: ITEM 1A.
