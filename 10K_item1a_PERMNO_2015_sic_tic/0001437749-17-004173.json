Additionally, the following risk factors could cause our actual results to materially differ from those reflected in any forward-looking statements.\nIf economic conditions decline, this could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. Uncertainty about global economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses postpone spending in response to tighter credit, unemployment, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on demand for our products and services. Our customers include pharmaceutical, food, medical and chemical companies; laboratories; government agencies; and public and private research institutions. The capital spending of these entities can have a significant effect on the demand for our products. Decreases in capital spending by any of these customer groups could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, business and results of operations.\nFurther, our customers\u2019 and independent representatives\u2019 ability to borrow money from their existing lenders or to obtain credit from other sources to purchase our products may be impacted. Although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and such losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same loss rates that we have in the past, especially given the current turmoil in certain parts of the worldwide economy. A significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of our customers could cause unfavorable trends in our receivable collections and additional allowances may be required, which could adversely affect our operating results. If investors have concerns that our business, operating results and financial condition will be negatively impacted by a worldwide economic downturn, our share price could decrease.\nIf we violate the terms of our credit agreement and financial covenants, it could cause our lender to demand immediate repayment of our credit facilities.\nWe have a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, our primary lender, with which we entered into a line of credit through August 26, 2018. Our credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank includes various financial and restrictive covenants. Our current internal projections indicate that we will be in compliance with our financial and restrictive covenants for the next 12 months. However, unforeseen circumstances may develop which could result in us violating our loan covenants. If we violate the terms of our credit agreement, including our financial and restrictive covenants, Wells Fargo Bank could deem us to be in default and require us to immediately repay the entire outstanding balance of our credit facilities, if any. If we do not have the funds available to repay the credit facilities or we cannot find another source of financing, we may fail to meet the terms of our agreement which could decrease the value of our common stock or have other material adverse consequences for us.\nSome of the markets in which we operate have experienced minimal growth in recent years, and in the case of the oil and gas market has experienced declines, and our ability to increase our revenue will depend in part on our ability to develop new products, develop new applications for our existing products or acquire complementary businesses and product lines.\nWe have identified a number of strategies that we believe will allow us to grow our business and increase our revenue in markets experiencing minimal growth. This includes developing new products and technologies, entering new markets such as food safety, developing new applications for our technologies, acquiring complementary businesses and product lines, and strengthening our sales force. However, we can make no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these strategies, or that these strategies will result in the growth of our business or an increase in our revenue. Acquisitions that we may find attractive may be subject to the consent of Wells Fargo Bank under the credit agreement we have executed with them.\nIf we fail to attract and retain qualified managerial and technical personnel, we may fail to remain competitive.\nOur future success depends, in significant part, upon the continued service and performance of our senior management and other key personnel. We rely on knowledgeable, experienced and skilled technical personnel, particularly engineers, scientists and service personnel, to design, assemble, sell and service our products. The loss of the services of our management team, some of whom have significant experience in our industry, and other key personnel could impair our ability to effectively manage our company and to carry out our business plan. Our inability to attract or retain qualified personnel could have a significant negative effect and thereby materially harm our business.\nWe face risks of technological changes that may render our products obsolete.\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by technological change and evolving industry standards. As a result of such changes and evolving standards, our products may become noncompetitive or obsolete and we may have to develop new products in order to maintain or increase our revenue. New product introductions that are responsive to these factors require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing process levels, and we may not be able to timely develop new products. In addition, industry acceptance of new technologies that we may develop may be slow due to, among other things, existing regulations or standards written specifically for older technologies and general unfamiliarity of users with new technologies. As a result, any new products that we may develop may not generate any meaningful revenue or profits for us for a number of years, if at all.\nA significant portion of our revenue is generated from foreign countries and selling in foreign countries entails a number of risks which could result in a decrease in our revenue or an increase in our operating expenses.\nRevenue outside the United States accounted for approximately 66 percent of our revenue in 2016, 66 percent in 2015 and 69 percent in 2014, and we expect that foreign revenue will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the future. Revenue to customers in foreign countries are subject to a number of risks including, among others:\n\u25cf\nagreements may be difficult to enforce;\n\u25cf\nreceivables may be difficult to collect;\n\u25cf\ncertain regions may experience political unrest and conflict and economic instability;\n\u25cf\nforeign customers may have longer payment cycles;\n\u25cf\nthe countries into which we sell may impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade;\n\u25cf\ncurrency fluctuations could reduce reported revenue and profitability in future periods;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand;\n\u25cf\nlegal and regulatory requirements may be difficult to monitor and comply with, especially if inconsistent with U.S. laws and regulations;\n\u25cf\ncustomizing products for foreign countries and managing and staffing international operations may lead to increased costs; and\n\u25cf\nprotection of intellectual property in foreign countries may be more difficult to enforce.\nIf any of these risks were to materialize, our revenue into foreign countries could decline, or our operating costs could increase, which would adversely affect our financial results.\nA portion of our revenue is derived from third party distributors and a disruption to our relationship with them could adversely impact our business. In addition, a portion of our international revenue is derived through third party distributors. As a result, we are dependent upon the financial health of our distributors. We also are dependent upon the compliance of our distributors with foreign laws and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA. If a distributor were to go out of business, it would take substantial time, cost and resources to find a suitable replacement.\nFurther, changes to tax and trade policies, international trade agreements and other governmental regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries could adversely affect our ability to sell our products in countries outside the United States, increases the costs of selling outside the United States or decrease the profitability of selling outside the United States. Recent elections in the United States could increase the likelihood of any such change being pursued by the United States government.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our cash, revenue and earnings.\nBecause the functional currency of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency, we are exposed to foreign currency transaction risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business, such as revenue to third party customers and purchases from suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. At December 31, 2016, there were no forward contract hedge instruments in place in our foreign operations.\nSome of our competitors have greater resources than we do, which may provide our competitors with an advantage in the development and marketing of new products.\nWe currently encounter, and expect to continue to encounter, competition in the sale of our products. We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our products include product quality and performance, price, reliability and customer service. Our competitors include large multinational corporations. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can. In addition, competition could increase if new companies enter the market or if existing competitors expand their product lines or intensify efforts within existing product lines. Our current products, products under development and our ability to discover new technologies may be insufficient to enable us to compete effectively with our competitors.\nOur reliance upon patents, domestic trademark laws, trade secrets and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property from others who may sell similar products.\nWe hold patents relating to various aspects of our products and believe that proprietary technical know-how is critical to many of our products. Proprietary rights relating to our products are protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are maintained in confidence as trade secrets. We cannot be certain that we will be issued any patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us or that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad enough to protect our technology. In the absence of patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products or gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary know-how. Our competitors may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents, or they may use their resources to design comparable products that do not infringe our patents. We may incur substantial costs if our competitors initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents or if we initiate any proceedings to protect our proprietary rights. If the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. There may also be pending or issued patents held by parties not affiliated with us that relate to our products or technologies and we may need to acquire licenses to any such patents to continue selling some or all of our products. If we are required to obtain any such license in order to be able to continue to sell some or all of our products, we may not be able to do so on terms that are favorable to us, if at all.\nIn addition, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. Even if these confidentiality agreements are not breached, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past, and will likely continue to do so in the future, and any broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past, with closing prices ranging from a high of $19.65 and a low of $13.01 during 2016. Several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. Some of these factors include:\n\u25cf\nannouncements of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nquarterly fluctuations in our financial results;\n\u25cf\nmerger and acquisition activity in our industry segment;\n\u25cf\ncustomer contract awards;\n\u25cf\na change to the rates at which we have historically paid dividends, which could be impacted by our credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank;\n\u25cf\nchanges in regulation; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and political conditions in the various markets where our products are sold.\nIn addition, the share prices of instrumentation companies have experienced significant fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. This market volatility may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nComplying with securities laws and regulations is costly for us.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including regulations promulgated by the SEC and Nasdaq, are creating particular challenges for smaller publicly-held companies like us. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nWe are exposed to risks relating to our evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nOur efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding our assessment of its internal control over financial reporting have required and will continue to require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Although our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016 and our independent registered public accounting firm agreed, no assurance can be provided that our management or independent registered public accounting firm will reach a similar conclusion as of any later date. Our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nIf we experience any increase in the cost of raw materials or supplies, we may experience a decrease in profit margins.\nIn the past, the overall cost of the materials that we purchase has not risen much more than the rate of inflation. We believe that the price of our products and the prices of our competitors\u2019 products is a significant factor affecting our customers\u2019 buying decisions and consequently, we may not be able to pass along any cost increases in raw materials and supplies in the form of price increases or sustain profit margins that we have achieved in prior years.\nWe have spent significant resources to develop new products, and the realized revenue from these products may be minimal for a time frame after each new product is being introduced to the marketplace.\nIn recent years we began to market new products including next generation of existing products such as the OX-TRAN 2/22, PERMATRAN-W 3/34 and LeakProtego. We believe that there are significant markets for our new products and while we believe these products are superior in many respects to similar products being sold by our competitors, each one is new to the marketplace and may not gain the market acceptance necessary to allow us to capitalize on what we believe will be an increasing demand in the industries for which products are utilized. While we have realized increasing revenue of products introduced in the marketplace historically, there can be no assurance that revenue of these products will continue. While we believe our recent new product offerings represent a dramatic improvement over existing technology being used in the respective applications, for some of them, we have not realized significant revenue to date.\nIf we are not able to successfully market new products, we will not recover the significant research and development and other expenses we have incurred to bring these products to market.\nOur information systems are critical to our business. If our information systems fail to adequately perform, or any our systems were accessed by unauthorized parties, our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe have many information systems that are critical to our business. These information systems are used to record, process, summarize, transmit, and store electronic information, including, among other things, sensitive data related to our research and development efforts and third party information. Although we take steps to secure our information systems and protect data stored on these systems, the security measures we have implemented may not be effective and our systems may be vulnerable to theft, loss, damage, and interruption from a number of potential sources and events, including unauthorized access or security breaches, cyber attacks, computer or other disruptive events. Any unauthorized access of our information systems or loss of information stored on our information systems could result in legal claims or proceedings and could disrupt our business and harm our reputation, which cause our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results to suffer.\nBeginning in 2015, we implemented a realignment plan (\u201cRealignment Plan\u201d), which may result in additional or unanticipated non-recurring charges, and we may not be able to achieve the cost savings and other benefits expected from these realignment efforts.\nThroughout 2015, we completed an initiative to reduce the number of legal entities by merging those entities into other legal entities we have. This initiative is intended to reduce the complexity and administrative burden and cost of maintaining those legal entities. Further, to improve our profitability, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we brought the Package Testing and Permeation segment sales and marketing functions under common leadership and decreased our U.S. headcount by 5 percent. We continued these efforts during 2016, with the elimination of the chief operating officer position and the hiring of a Sr. VP of Global Sales and Marketing, and other personnel changes. These changes were also designed to strengthen our market presence and provide a cost-effective approach to achieving our objectives.\nHowever, we may not be able to achieve the level of benefits that we expect to realize from these or any future realignment activities, within expected timeframes, or at all. Changes in the amount, timing and character of charges related to our current or future realignment activities and the failure to complete, or a substantial delay in completing, our current and any future realignment plan could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.", "PERMNO": 54675, "SIC": 3829, "TIC": "MOCO"}
