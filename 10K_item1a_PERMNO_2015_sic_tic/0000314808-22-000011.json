Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business, Operations, Indebtedness and Market Conditions\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely impacted, and could continue to adversely impact, our financial condition and results of operations.\nBeginning in March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures implemented by governments worldwide negatively impacted the global macroeconomic environment and resulted in a sharp decline in global oil demand and prices. In response to reduced oil price expectations, our customers significantly lowered their capital expenditure plans. As of February 2022, crude oil prices and demand have recovered from the historic lows seen in the first half of 2020. While the near-term outlook for the offshore drilling industry has improved, particularly for floaters, the global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic remains uneven, and there is still uncertainty around the sustainability of the improvement in oil prices and the recovery in demand for offshore drilling services.\nTo date, there have been various impacts from the pandemic and the resultant drop in oil prices, including contract cancellations and the delay or cancellation of drilling programs by operators, contract concessions, stacking rigs, inability to change crews due to travel restrictions, and workforce reductions. Our operations and business may be subject to further disruptions as a result of the spread of COVID-19 and its variants among our workforce, the extension or imposition of further public health measures affecting our supply chain and logistics, and the impact of the pandemic on key customers, suppliers, and other counterparties. In addition, government vaccine mandates and the vaccination requirements of our customers could affect our ability to retain offshore crews or require us to increase wages to retain qualified personnel for our drilling rigs.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could continue to adversely impact the supply chain for equipment or services needed for operations, including as a result of mandatory shutdowns and other pandemic-related measures implemented in locations where such equipment or services are manufactured or distributed. In addition to experiencing increased shipping costs, we could also see significant disruptions of the operations to our logistics and service providers.\nOil prices may continue to be volatile as a result of production instability, ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks, including variant strains of COVID-19, the implementation of vaccination programs and the related impact on overall economic activity, global inflation, changes in oil inventories, industry demand and global and national economic performance.\nThe success of our business largely depends on the level of activity in offshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, which can be significantly affected by volatile oil and natural gas prices.\nThe success of our business largely depends on the level of activity in offshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production. Oil and natural gas prices, and market expectations of potential changes in these prices, significantly affect the level of drilling activity. Historically, when operator capital spending declines, utilization and day rates also decline and drilling may be reduced or discontinued, resulting in an oversupply of drilling rigs. The oversupply of drilling rigs may be exacerbated by the entry of newbuild rigs into the market. Oil and natural gas prices declined significantly from prices in excess of $100 since mid-2014, causing operators to reduce capital spending and cancel or defer existing programs, substantially reducing the opportunities for new drilling contracts. While market conditions have recently improved, we have not yet experienced an extended period of sustained oil and natural gas prices. The lack of a sustained and stable recovery of oil and natural gas prices, further price reductions or volatility in prices may cause our customers to lower levels of capital spending or reduce their overall level of activity, in which case demand for our services may decline and revenues may be adversely affected through lower rig utilization and/or lower day rates. Numerous factors may affect oil and natural gas prices and the level of demand for our services, including:\n\u2022regional and global economic conditions and changes therein,\n\u2022COVID-19 and related public health measures implemented by governments worldwide and the occurrence or threat of other epidemic or pandemic diseases, including variants of COVID-19, and any government response to such occurrence or threat,\n\u2022oil and natural gas supply and demand, which is affected by worldwide economic activity and population growth,\n\u2022expectations regarding future energy prices,\n\u2022the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\"OPEC\") to reach further agreements to set and maintain production levels and pricing and to implement existing and future agreements,\n\u2022capital allocation decisions by our customers, including the relative economics of offshore development versus alternative prospects,\n\u2022the level of production by non-OPEC countries,\n\u2022U.S. and non-U.S. tax policy,\n\u2022advances in exploration and development technology,\n\u2022costs associated with exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas,\n\u2022the rate of discovery of new oil and gas reserves and the rate of decline of existing oil and gas reserves,\n\u2022investors reducing, or ceasing to provide, funding to the oil and gas industry in response to initiatives to limit climate change,\n\u2022laws and government regulations that limit, restrict or prohibit exploration and development of oil and natural gas in various jurisdictions, or materially increase the cost of such exploration and development (such as the current moratorium on oil and gas leasing and permitting in federal lands and waters, which is currently subject to ongoing litigation),\n\u2022the development and exploitation of alternative fuels or energy sources and increased demand for electric-powered vehicles,\n\u2022disruption to exploration and development activities due to hurricanes and other severe weather conditions and the risk thereof,\n\u2022natural disasters or incidents resulting from operating hazards inherent in offshore drilling, such as oil spills, and\n\u2022the worldwide military or political environment, including the global macroeconomic effects of trade disputes and increased tariffs and sanctions and uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities or other crises in oil or natural gas producing areas or geographic areas in which we operate, or acts of terrorism.\nThe agreements of OPEC and certain non-OPEC countries to freeze and/or cut production may not be fully realized. The lack of actual production cuts or freezes, or the perceived risk that OPEC countries may not comply with such agreements, may result in depressed commodity prices for an extended period of time.\nHigher commodity prices may not necessarily translate into increased activity, however, and even during periods of high commodity prices, customers may cancel or curtail their drilling programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditure for exploration and production for a variety of reasons, including their expectations for future oil prices, extended periods of price volatility and their lack of success in exploration efforts. Advances in onshore exploration and development technologies, particularly with respect to onshore shale, could also result in our customers allocating more of their capital expenditure budgets to onshore exploration and production activities and less to offshore activities. In addition, some of our customers are transitioning their businesses to renewable energy projects and away from oil and natural gas exploration and production, which could result in reduced capital spending by such customers on oil and natural gas projects and in turn reduced demand for our services. These factors could cause our revenues and profits to decline, as a result of declines in utilization and day rates, and limit our future growth prospects. Any significant decline in day rates or utilization of our drilling rigs could materially reduce our revenues and profitability. In addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate or are otherwise required by our contracts.\nThe offshore contract drilling industry historically has been highly competitive and cyclical, with periods of low demand and excess rig availability that could result in adverse effects on our business.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and our contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Pricing, safety records and competency are key factors in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a contract. Rig availability, location and technical capabilities also can be significant factors in the determination. If we are not able to compete successfully, our revenues and profitability may decline.\nDemand for offshore contract drilling services is highly cyclical, which is primarily driven by the demand for drilling rigs and the available supply of drilling rigs. Demand for drilling rigs is driven by the levels of offshore exploration and development conducted by oil and gas companies, which is beyond our control and may fluctuate substantially from year-to-year and from region-to-region.\nProlonged periods of reduced demand or excess rig supply have required us, and may in the future require us, to idle or scrap rigs and enter into low day rate contracts or contracts with unfavorable terms. There can be no assurance that the current demand for drilling rigs will increase in the future or that any short-term improvement to market conditions will be sustained. Any further decline in demand for drilling rigs, coupled with the prolonged oversupply of drilling rigs, could adversely affect our financial position, operating results or cash flows.\nOur current backlog of contract drilling revenue may not be fully realized and may decline significantly in the future.\nAs of February 21, 2022, our contract backlog was approximately $2.4 billion, which represents an increase of $1.4 billion to the reported backlog of $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2020. This amount reflects the remaining contractual terms multiplied by the applicable contractual day rate. The contractual revenue may be higher than the actual revenue we ultimately receive because of a number of factors, including rig downtime or suspension of operations. Several factors could cause rig downtime or a suspension of operations, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022the early termination, repudiation or renegotiation of contracts,\n\u2022breakdowns of equipment,\n\u2022work stoppages, including labor strikes,\n\u2022shortages of material or skilled labor,\n\u2022surveys by government and maritime authorities,\n\u2022periodic classification surveys,\n\u2022severe weather, strong ocean currents or harsh operating conditions,\n\u2022the occurrence or threat of epidemic or pandemic diseases and any government response to such occurrence or threat, and\n\u2022force majeure events.\nOur customers may seek to terminate, repudiate or renegotiate our drilling contracts for various reasons, including in the event of a total loss of the drilling rig, the suspension or interruption of operations for extended periods due to breakdown of major rig equipment, failure to comply with performance conditions or equipment specifications, \"force majeure\" events, the failure of the customer to receive final investment decision (FID) with respect to projects for which the drilling rig was contracted or other reasons. Generally, our drilling contracts permit early termination of the contract by the customer for convenience (without cause), exercisable upon advance notice to us, and in certain cases without making an early termination payment to us. There can be no assurances that our customers will be able to or willing to fulfill their contractual commitments to us.\nA decline in oil prices and any resulting downward pressure on utilization may cause some customers to consider early termination of select contracts despite having to pay onerous early termination fees in certain cases. Customers may request to renegotiate the terms of existing contracts, or they may request early termination or seek to repudiate contracts. Furthermore, as contracts expire, we may be unable to secure new contracts for our drilling rigs. Therefore, revenues recorded in future periods could differ materially from our current backlog. Our inability to realize the full amount of our contract backlog may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or cash flows.\nOur business will be adversely affected if we are unable to secure contracts on economically favorable terms or if option periods in existing contracts are not exercised as expected.\nOur ability to renew expiring contracts or obtain new contracts and the terms of any such contracts will depend on market conditions. Our customers\u2019 decisions to exercise option periods resulting in additional work for the rig under contract also depend on market conditions. We may be unable to renew our expiring contracts, including contracts expiring for failure by the customer to exercise option periods, or obtain new contracts for the drilling rigs under contracts that have expired or have been terminated, and the day rates under any new contracts or any renegotiated contracts may be substantially below the existing day rates, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. If customers do not exercise option periods under contracts that we currently expect to be exercised, we may face increased idle time associated with the related rig, as we may have difficulty securing additional work to cover the option period. In addition, we may choose to stack idle rigs that are not under contract, which would require us to incur stacking costs for such rigs.\nOur customers may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their contractual commitments to us, including their obligations to pay for losses, damages or other liabilities.\nCertain of our customers are subject to liquidity risk and such risk could lead them to seek to repudiate, cancel or renegotiate our drilling contracts or fail to fulfill their commitments to us under those contracts. These risks are heightened in periods of depressed market conditions. Our drilling contracts provide for varying levels of indemnification from our customers. Our drilling contracts also provide for varying levels of indemnification and allocation of liabilities between our customers and us with respect to loss or damage to property and injury or death to persons arising from the drilling operations we perform. Under our drilling contracts, liability with respect to personnel and property customarily is allocated so that we and our customers each assume liability for our respective personnel and property. Our customers have historically assumed most of the responsibility for and indemnified us from loss, damage or other liability resulting from pollution or contamination, including clean-up and removal and third-party damages arising from operations under the contract when the source of the pollution originates from the well or reservoir, including those resulting from blow-outs or cratering of the well. However, we regularly are required to assume a limited amount of liability for pollution damage caused by our negligence, which liability generally has caps for ordinary negligence, with much higher caps or unlimited liability where the damage is caused by our gross negligence or willful misconduct. Notwithstanding a contractual indemnity from a customer, there can be no assurance that our customers will be financially able to assume their responsibility and honor their indemnity to us for such losses. In addition, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, such indemnities under certain circumstances are not enforceable if the cause of the damage was our gross negligence or willful misconduct. This could result in us having to assume liabilities in excess of those agreed in our contracts due to customer balance sheet or liquidity issues or applicable law.\nWe may suffer losses if our customers terminate or seek to renegotiate our contracts, if operations are suspended or interrupted or if a rig becomes a total loss.\nIn market downturns, our customers may not be able to honor the terms of existing contracts, may terminate contracts even where there may be onerous termination fees, may seek to void or otherwise repudiate our contracts including by claiming we have breached the contract, or may seek to renegotiate contract day rates and terms. Our drilling contracts may be subject to termination without cause or termination for convenience upon notice by the customer. In certain cases, our contracts require the customer to pay an early termination fee in the event of an early termination for convenience (without cause), exercisable upon advance notice to us. Such payment would provide some level of compensation to us for the lost revenue from the contract but in many cases would not fully compensate us for all of the lost revenue. Certain contracts may permit termination by the customer without an early termination fee. Furthermore, financially distressed customers may seek to negotiate reduced termination fees as part of a restructuring package.\nDrilling contracts customarily specify automatic termination or termination at the option of the customer in the event of a total loss of the drilling rig and often include provisions addressing termination rights or reduction or cessation of day rates if operations are suspended or interrupted for extended periods due to breakdown of major rig equipment, unsatisfactory performance, \"force majeure\" events beyond the control of either party or other specified conditions.\nIf a customer cancels a contract or if we terminate a contract due to the customer\u2019s breach and, in either case, we are unable to secure a new contract on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, or if a contract is disputed or suspended for an extended period of time or renegotiated, it could materially and adversely affect our financial position, operating results or cash flows.\nThe loss of a significant customer or customer contract, as well as customer consolidation and changes to customer strategy, could adversely affect us.\nWe provide our services to major international, government-owned and independent oil and gas companies. During the eight months ended December 31, 2021 (Successor), our five largest customers accounted for 42% of consolidated revenues, with our largest customer representing 11% of our consolidated revenues and a significant percentage of our operating cash flows. During the four months ended April 30, 2021 (Predecessor), our five largest customers accounted for 45% of consolidated revenues. BP, our only customer who accounts for 10% or more of consolidated revenues, accounted for 14% of consolidated revenues. Our financial position, operating results or cash flows may be materially adversely affected if any of our higher day rate contracts were terminated or renegotiated on less favorable terms or if a major customer terminates its contracts with us, fails to renew its existing contracts with us, requires renegotiation of our contracts or declines to award new contracts to us.\nSome of our customers have consolidated and could use their size and purchasing power to achieve economies of scale and pricing concessions. In addition, certain of our customers are increasingly focusing their business strategy on renewable energy projects and away from oil and gas exploration and production. Such customer consolidation and strategic transitions could result in reduced capital spending by such customers, decreased demand for our drilling services, loss of competitive position and negative pricing impacts. If we cannot maintain service and pricing levels for existing customers or replace such revenues with increased business activities from other customers, our results of operations or financial condition will be negatively impacted.\nRig reactivation, upgrade and enhancement projects are subject to risks, including delays and cost overruns, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or cash flows.\nThe costs required to reactivate a stacked rig and return the rig to drilling service are significant. Depending on the length of time that a rig has been stacked, we may incur significant costs to restore the rig to drilling capability, which may also include capital expenditures due to, among other things, technological obsolescence or an equipment overhaul of the rig. During 2022, we currently anticipate that we will be reactivating four floater rigs. These drilling rigs were previously stacked, and expenditures will be required to return these rigs to drilling service. In the future, market conditions may not justify these types of expenditures or enable us to operate our rigs profitably during the remainder of their economic lives. In addition, we may not recover the expenditures incurred to reactivate rigs through the associated drilling contract or otherwise. We can provide no assurance that we will have access to adequate or economical sources of capital to fund the return of stacked rigs to drilling service.\nDuring periods of increased rig reactivation, upgrade and enhancement projects, shipyards and third-party equipment vendors may be under significant resource constraints to meet delivery obligations. Such constraints may lead to substantial delivery and commissioning delays, equipment failures and/or quality deficiencies. Furthermore, drilling rigs may face start-up or other operational complications following completion of upgrades or maintenance. Other unexpected difficulties, including equipment failures, design or engineering problems, could result in significant downtime at reduced or zero day rates or the cancellation or termination of drilling contracts.\nRig reactivation, upgrade, life extension and repair projects are subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns, including the following:\n\u2022failure of third-party equipment to meet quality and/or performance standards,\n\u2022delays in equipment deliveries or shipyard construction,\n\u2022shortages of materials or skilled labor,\n\u2022disruptions occurring as the result of COVID-19 and related public health measures implemented by governments worldwide,\n\u2022damage to shipyard facilities, including damage resulting from fire, explosion, flooding, severe weather, terrorism, war or other armed hostilities,\n\u2022unforeseen design or engineering problems, including those relating to the commissioning of newly designed equipment,\n\u2022unanticipated actual or purported change orders,\n\u2022strikes, labor disputes or work stoppages,\n\u2022financial or operating difficulties of equipment vendors or the shipyard while enhancing, upgrading, improving or repairing a rig or rigs,\n\u2022unanticipated cost increases,\n\u2022foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacting overall cost,\n\u2022inability to obtain the requisite permits or approvals,\n\u2022client acceptance delays,\n\u2022disputes with shipyards and suppliers,\n\u2022latent damages or deterioration to hull, equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions,\n\u2022claims of force majeure events, and\n\u2022additional risks inherent to shipyard projects in a non-U.S. location.\nWe have historically made substantial expenditures to meet customer requirements, maintain our fleet to comply with laws and the applicable regulations and standards of governmental authorities and organizations, or to expand our fleet, and we may be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain our competitiveness.\nWe have historically made substantial expenditures to maintain our fleet. These expenditures could increase as a result of changes in:\n\u2022offshore drilling technology,\n\u2022the cost of labor and materials,\n\u2022customer requirements,\n\u2022fleet size,\n\u2022the cost of replacement parts for existing drilling rigs,\n\u2022the geographic location of the drilling rigs,\n\u2022length of drilling contracts,\n\u2022governmental regulations and maritime self-regulatory organization and technical standards relating to safety, security or the environment, and\n\u2022industry standards.\nChanges in offshore drilling technology, customer requirements for new or upgraded equipment, such as equipping the VALARIS DS-11 with 20,000 psi well-control equipment, and competition within our industry may require us to make significant capital expenditures. In addition, changes in governmental regulations relating to decarbonization, environmental, emissions, safety or equipment standards, as well as compliance with standards imposed by maritime self-regulatory organizations, may require us to make additional unforeseen capital expenditures. In addition, commitments made by us, or our customers, to reduce emissions, or decarbonize, may require us to upgrade or retrofit our drilling rigs with additional equipment, less carbon intensive equipment or instrumentation. As a result, we may be required to take our drilling rigs out of service for extended periods of time, with corresponding losses of revenues, in order to make such alterations or to add such equipment. In the future, market conditions may not justify these expenditures or enable us to operate our drilling rigs profitably during the remainder of their economic useful lives.\nAdditionally, in order to expand our fleet, we may require additional capital in the future. If we are unable to fund capital requirements with cash flows from operations or proceeds from sales of non-core assets, we may be required to either incur additional borrowings or raise capital through the sale of debt or equity securities. Our ability to access the capital markets may be limited by our financial condition at the time, by restrictive covenants in our debt agreements, bye-laws and regulations and by adverse market conditions resulting from, among others, general economic conditions, contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control. Similarly, when lenders and institutional investors reduce, and in some cases cease to provide, funding to industry borrowers, the liquidity and financial condition of us and our customers can be adversely impacted. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, existing shareholders may experience dilution, and if we raise funds by issuing additional debt securities, we may have to pledge some, or all, of our assets as collateral. Our failure to obtain the funds for necessary future capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business and on our financial position, operating results or cash flows.\nFailure to recruit and retain skilled personnel could adversely affect our business.\nWe require skilled personnel to operate our drilling rigs and to provide technical services and support for our business, and our rig reactivation program will require that we hire additional skilled personnel. Competition for the labor required for drilling operations and construction projects has recently intensified as the number of active drilling rigs has increased, potentially leading to shortages of qualified personnel in the industry. During such periods of intensified competition, it is more difficult and costly to recruit, train and retain qualified employees, including in foreign countries that require a certain percentage of national employees. The recent prolonged industry downturn and reductions in offshore personnel wages further reduced the number of qualified personnel available. As demand for our services has increased, competition for labor has intensified, resulting in higher wages in order to retain qualified offshore personnel. The increase in wages causes an increase in operating expenses, with a resulting reduction in net income, and our ability to fully staff and operate our drilling rigs may be negatively affected. In addition, due to the specialized skills and qualifications required to operate an offshore drilling rig, new personnel that we hire may need to undergo training to develop the skills needed to perform their job duties. There can be no assurance that our training programs will be adequate for these purposes, which could expose us to operational hazards and risks. We may also incur additional training costs to ensure that new or promoted personnel have the right skills and qualifications.\nIn an environment where competition for labor is intense, we may be required to increase existing levels of compensation to retain our skilled workforce, especially if our competitors raise their wage rates. We also are subject to potential legislative or regulatory action that may impact working conditions, paid time off or other conditions of employment, including mandated vaccination programs. These conditions could further increase our costs or limit our ability to fully staff and operate our drilling rigs.\nOur shared service center may not create the operational efficiencies that we expect, and may create risks relating to the processing of transactions and recording of financial information, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results or cash flows.\nWe have undertaken a shared service center initiative pursuant to which we are outsourcing certain finance, human resources, supply chain and IT functions. We have and will continue to align the design and operation of our financial control environment as part of our shared service center initiative. As part of this initiative, we are outsourcing, and will continue to outsource, certain accounting, payroll, human resources, supply chain and IT functions to a third-party service provider. The party that we utilize for these services may not be able to handle the volume of activity or perform the quality of service necessary to support our operations. The failure of the third-party to fulfill its obligations could disrupt our operations. In addition, the move to a shared service environment, including our reliance on a third-party provider, may create risks relating to the processing of transactions and recording of financial information. We could experience a lapse in the operation of internal controls due to turnover, lack of legacy knowledge, inappropriate training and use of a third-party provider, which could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and have an adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results or cash flows.\nWe may not realize the expected benefits of ARO, which depends on a single customer for its income and accounts receivable, and our inability to realize such benefits may introduce additional risks to our business.\nOur 50/50 joint venture with Saudi Aramco, ARO, has plans to purchase 20 newbuild jackup rigs over an approximate 10-year period. In January 2020, ARO ordered the first two newbuild jackups. The first rig is expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2022, and the second rig is expected either late in the fourth quarter of 2022 or in the first quarter of 2023. ARO is expected to place orders for two additional newbuild jackups in 2022. There can be no assurance that the new jackup rigs will begin operations as anticipated or we will realize the expected return on our investment. We may also experience difficulty in jointly managing the venture. Further, in the event ARO has insufficient cash from operations or is unable to obtain third-party financing, we may periodically be required to make additional capital contributions to ARO, up to a maximum aggregate contribution of $1.25 billion. Any required capital contributions we make will negatively impact our liquidity position and financial condition.\nIn 2017 and 2018, Rowan Companies Limited (formerly Rowan Companies plc) (\"Rowan\") issued 10-year shareholder notes receivables to ARO, which are governed by the laws of Saudi Arabia, earn interest based on a one-year LIBOR rate, set as of the end of the year prior to the year applicable, plus two percent and mature during 2027 and 2028. In the event of a dispute with ARO over the repayment of the long-term notes receivable, our ability to enforce the payment obligations of ARO or to exercise other remedies are subject to several significant limitations, including that our ability to accelerate outstanding amounts under the long-term notes receivable is subject to the consent of Saudi Aramco and that the long-term notes receivable are governed by the laws of Saudi Arabia and we are limited to the remedies available under Saudi law.\nAs a result of these risks, it may take longer than expected for us to realize the expected returns from ARO or such returns may ultimately be less than anticipated. Additionally, if we are unable to make any required contributions, our ownership in ARO could be diluted which could hinder our ability to effectively manage ARO and adversely impact our operating results or financial condition.\nARO\u2019s income and accounts receivable are concentrated with one customer. The loss of this customer, or a substantial decrease in demand by this customer for ARO\u2019s services, would have a material adverse effect on ARO\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, which could adversely impact our operating results or financial condition.\nARO, as a provider of offshore drilling services, faces many of the same risks as we face. Operating through ARO, in which we have a shared interest, may result in our having less control over many decisions made with respect to projects, operations, safety, utilization, internal controls and other operating and financial matters. ARO may not apply the same controls and policies that we follow to manage our risks, and ARO\u2019s controls and policies may not be as effective. As a result, operational, financial and control issues may arise, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, in order to establish or preserve our relationship with our joint venture partner we may agree to risks and contributions of resources that are proportionately greater than the returns we could receive, which could reduce our income and return on our investment in ARO compared to what we may traditionally require in other areas of our business.\nOur information technology systems, including rig operating systems, and critical data are subject to cybersecurity risks.\nWe depend on technologies, systems and networks to conduct our offshore operations and help run our financial and onshore operations functions, including the collection of payments from customers, payments to vendors and employees and storage of company records. Our information technology and infrastructure may fail or be subject to flaws that could adversely impact our business. In addition, despite our security measures, we could be vulnerable to attacks by third-parties or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. The risks associated with the failure of our computer systems and cyber incidents and attacks on our information technology systems could include disruptions of certain systems on our rigs; other impairments of our ability to conduct our operations, including disruptions in our ability to make or receive payments and financial and onshore operating functions, loss of intellectual property, proprietary information, customer and vendor data or other sensitive information; corruption or unauthorized release of our or our customer\u2019s critical data; disruption of our or our customers' operations; and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events. Any such breach or attack could result in injury to people, loss of control of, or damage to, our, or our customer's, assets, downtime, loss of revenue or harm to the environment. Any such breach or attack could also compromise our networks or our customers' and vendors' networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in significant fines, civil and/or criminal claims or proceedings. Laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential or protected information, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potential costs, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties and legal liability. Disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation could adversely affect our financial position, operating results or cash flows. In the past, we have experienced data security breaches resulting from unauthorized access to our systems, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations; however, there can be no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future. There can also be no assurance that our efforts, or the efforts of our partners and vendors, to invest in the protection of information technology infrastructure and data will prevent or identify breaches in our systems.\nWe may have difficulty obtaining or maintaining insurance in the future on terms we find acceptable and our insurance coverage cannot protect us against all of the risks and hazards we face, including those specific to offshore operations.\nOur operations are subject to hazards inherent in the offshore drilling industry, such as blow-outs, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well-control, uncontrolled formation pressures, lost or stuck drill strings, equipment failures and mechanical breakdowns, punch-throughs, craterings, industrial accidents, fires, explosions, oil spills and pollution. These hazards can cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, which could lead to claims by third-parties or customers or prosecution by governmental authorities, suspension of operations and contract terminations. Our fleet is also subject to hazards inherent in marine operations, either while on-site or during mobilization, such as punch-throughs, capsizing, sinking, grounding, mooring failures, collision, damage from severe weather and marine life infestations. We have safety processes in place in an effort to mitigate the risks of the above hazards occurring, but our processes may not be effective to fully eliminate these risks or may not be followed. Additionally, a cyber-attack or other security breach of our information systems or other technological failure could lead to a material disruption of our operations, information systems and/or loss of business information, which could result in an adverse impact to our business. Our drilling contracts provide for varying levels of indemnification from our customers, including with respect to well-control and subsurface risks. For example, most of our drilling contracts include limitations in the form of liability caps for damages and losses resulting from our gross negligence and willful misconduct and for fines and penalties and punitive damages levied or assessed directly against us.\nWe generally identify and assess the operational hazards for which we will procure insurance coverage based on the likelihood of loss, the potential magnitude of loss, the cost, availability and reliability of insurance coverage, the requirements of our customer contracts and applicable legal requirements. Although we maintain what we believe to be an appropriate level of insurance covering hazards and risks we currently encounter during our operations, it is not possible to obtain insurance against all potential risks and hazards, nor may it always be possible to maintain the same levels and types of coverage that we have maintained in the past. Cyclical insurance market conditions, major insurance losses, changes in the perceived risk exposure, new regulations, changes in our financial position and/or our operating conditions could cause insurance companies to increase our premiums and deductibles or limit our coverage amounts.\nAs a result of climate change activism or increased costs to insurance companies due to regulatory, geopolitical or other developments, insurance companies that have historically participated in underwriting energy-related risks may discontinue that practice, may reduce the insurance capacity they are willing to deploy or demand significantly higher premiums or deductibles to cover these risks. Additionally, a significant number of high cost energy-related insurance claims or natural catastrophes such as floods, windstorms or earthquakes may result in withdrawal of insurance capacity and increasing premiums to energy industry companies.\nFurthermore, our insurance carriers may interpret our insurance policies such that they do not provide coverage for all of our losses. Our insurance policies also have exclusions of coverage for some losses. Uninsured exposures may include radiation hazards, certain loss or damage to property onboard our drilling rigs, loss of hire and losses relating to terrorist acts or strikes and some cyber events.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain adequate insurance at rates and with deductibles or retention amounts that we consider commercially reasonable, we may choose to forgo insurance coverage and retain the associated risk of loss or damage.\nIf a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or contractual indemnity (or if our contractual indemnity is not enforceable under applicable law or our clients are unable to meet their indemnification obligation), it could adversely affect our financial position, operating results or cash flows.\nThe potential for U.S. Gulf of Mexico hurricane related windstorm damage or liabilities could result in uninsured losses and may cause us to alter our operating procedures during hurricane season.\nCertain areas of the world, such as the U.S. Gulf of Mexico experience hurricanes or similar extreme weather conditions on a relatively frequent basis. Some of our drilling rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico are located in areas that could cause them to be susceptible to damage and/or total loss by these storms. We had 10 rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as of December 31, 2021. Damage caused by high winds and turbulent seas could result in personal injury, rig loss or damage, termination of drilling contracts for lost or severely damaged rigs or curtailment of operations on damaged drilling rigs with reduced or suspended day rates for significant periods of time until the damage can be repaired. Moreover, even if our drilling rigs are not directly damaged by such storms, we may experience disruptions in our operations due to damage to our customers' platforms and other related facilities in the area. Our drilling operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have been impacted by hurricanes in the past, including the total loss of drilling rigs, with associated losses of contract revenues and potential liabilities.\nInsurance companies incurred substantial losses in the offshore drilling, exploration and production industries as a consequence of hurricanes that occurred in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during 2004, 2005 and 2008. Accordingly, insurance companies have substantially reduced the nature and amount of insurance coverage available for losses arising from named tropical storm or hurricane damage in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and have dramatically increased the cost of available windstorm coverage. The tight insurance market not only applies to coverage related to U.S. Gulf of Mexico windstorm damage or loss of our drilling rigs, but also impacts coverage for any potential liabilities to third-parties associated with property damage, personal injury or death and environmental liabilities, as well as coverage for removal of wreckage and debris associated with hurricane losses. It is likely that the tight insurance market for windstorm damage, liabilities and removal of wreckage and debris will continue into the foreseeable future.\nWe have not purchased windstorm insurance for hull and machinery losses to our drilling rigs arising from windstorm damage in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico due to the significant premium, high deductible and limited coverage for windstorm damage. We believe it is no longer customary for drilling contractors with similar size and fleet composition to purchase windstorm insurance for drilling rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for the aforementioned reasons. Accordingly, we have retained the risk of loss or damage for our drilling rigs arising from windstorm damage in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.\nWe have established operational procedures designed to mitigate risk to our drilling rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during hurricane season, and these procedures may, on occasion, result in a decision to decline to operate on a customer-designated location during hurricane season notwithstanding that the location, water depth and other standard operating conditions are within a rig's normal operating range. Our procedures and the associated regulatory requirements addressing drilling rig operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during hurricane season, coupled with our decision to retain (self-insure) certain windstorm-related risks, may result in a significant reduction in the utilization of our jackups in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.\nAny retained exposures for property loss or damage and wreckage and debris removal or other liabilities associated with U.S. Gulf of Mexico tropical storms or hurricanes may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or cash flows if we sustain significant uninsured or underinsured losses or liabilities as a result of these storms or hurricanes.\nGeopolitical events and violence could affect the markets for our services and have a material adverse effect on our business and cost and availability of insurance.\nGeopolitical events have resulted in military actions, terrorist, pirate and other armed attacks, civil unrest, political demonstrations, mass strikes and government responses. Military action by the United States or other nations could escalate, and acts of terrorism, piracy, kidnapping, extortion, acts of war, violence, civil war or general disorder may initiate or continue. Such acts could be directed against companies such as ours. Such developments have caused instability in the world\u2019s financial and insurance markets in the past. In addition, these developments could lead to increased volatility in prices for oil and natural gas and could affect the markets for our services, particularly to the extent that such events take place in regions with significant oil and natural gas reserves, refining facilities or transportation infrastructure. Insurance premiums could increase and coverage for these kinds of events may be unavailable in the future. Any or all of these effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or cash flows.\nOur drilling contracts with national oil companies may expose us to greater risks than we normally assume in drilling contracts with non-governmental customers.\nWe currently own and operate 15 drilling rigs that are contracted with national oil companies. The terms of these contracts are often non-negotiable and may expose us to greater commercial, political and operational risks than we assume in other contracts, such as exposure to materially greater environmental liability, personal injury and other claims for damages (including consequential damages), or, in certain cases, the risk of early termination of the contract for convenience (without cause), exercisable upon advance notice to us, contractually or by governmental action, without making an early termination payment to us. We can provide no assurance that the increased risk exposure will not have an adverse impact on our future operations or that we will not increase the number of drilling rigs contracted to national oil companies with commensurate additional contractual risks.\nUnionization efforts and labor regulations in certain countries in which we operate could materially increase our costs or limit our flexibility with regard to the management of our personnel.\nOutside of the U.S., we are often subject to collective bargaining agreements that require periodic salary negotiations, which usually result in higher personnel expenses and other benefits. Efforts have been made from time to time to unionize other portions of our workforce. In addition, we have been subjected to strikes or work stoppages and other labor disruptions in certain countries. Additional unionization efforts, new collective bargaining agreements or work stoppages could materially increase our costs, reduce our revenues or limit our flexibility.\nCertain legal obligations require us to contribute certain amounts to retirement funds or other benefit plans and restrict our ability to dismiss employees. Future regulations or court interpretations established in the countries in which we conduct our operations could increase our costs and materially adversely affect our business, financial position, operating results or cash flows.\nSignificant equipment or part shortages, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality and sourcing issues or price increases could increase our operating costs, decrease our revenues and adversely impact our operations.\nOur reliance on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, parts, components and sub-systems used in our operations exposes us to potential volatility in the quality, prices and availability of such items. Certain high-specification parts and equipment that we use in our operations may be available only from a small number of suppliers, manufacturers or service providers, or in some cases must be sourced through a single supplier, manufacturer or service provider. The business environment since the 2014 downturn as well as industry consolidation has reduced the number of available suppliers, and our suppliers have been and may continue to be impacted by supply chain and logistics disruptions that began during the COVID-19 pandemic. A disruption in the deliveries from such third-party suppliers, manufacturers or service providers, capacity constraints, production disruptions, price increases, including those related to inflation and supply chain disruption, quality control issues, recalls or other decreased availability of parts and equipment could adversely affect our ability to meet our commitments to customers by making it cost prohibitive to do so, thus adversely impacting our operations and revenues and/or our operating costs. Delays in the delivery of critical drilling equipment could cause unscheduled operational downtime, or such delays could cause our drilling rigs to be unavailable within the commencement window established by the operator in the contract and subject us to potential termination of the contract for such late delivery of the drilling rig.\nWe may incur impairments as a result of future declines in demand for offshore drilling rigs.\nWe evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment, primarily our drilling rigs, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such rigs may not be recoverable. The offshore drilling industry historically has been highly cyclical, and it is not unusual for rigs to be idle or underutilized for significant periods of time and subsequently resume full or near full utilization when business cycles change. Likewise, during periods in which rig supply exceeds rig demand, competition may force us to contract our rigs at or near cash break-even rates for extended periods of time.\nSince 2014 Predecessor has recorded pre-tax, non-cash losses on impairment of long-lived assets totaling $9.8 billion, including $756.5 million aggregate pre-tax, non-cash impairments with respect to certain floaters, jackups and spare equipment, which Predecessor recorded during the first quarter of 2021. See \"Note 8 - Property and Equipment\" to our consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\nOur long-term contracts are subject to the risk of cost increases, which could adversely impact our profitability.\nIn general, our costs increase as the demand for contract drilling services and skilled labor increases. While some of our contracts include cost escalation provisions that allow changes to our day rate based on stipulated cost increases or decreases, the timing and amount earned from these day rate adjustments may differ from our actual increase in costs and many contracts do not allow for such day rate adjustments. During times of reduced demand, reductions in costs may not be immediate as portions of the crew may be required to prepare our rigs for stacking, after which time the crew members are assigned to active rigs or dismissed. Moreover, as our rigs are mobilized from one geographic location to another, the labor and other operating and maintenance costs can vary significantly. In general, labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels in a particular geographic location and inflation. Equipment maintenance expenses fluctuate depending upon the type of activity a drilling rig is performing and the age and condition of the equipment, as well as the impact of supply chain disruptions and inflation on the costs of parts and materials. Contract preparation expenses vary based on the scope and length of contract preparation required.\nOur ability to pay our operating and capital expenses and make payments due on our debt depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to pay our operating and capital expenses and make payments due on our debt depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, legislative and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. The First Lien Notes contain payment-in-kind interest provisions, which reduce the cash needed to pay interest while increasing the principal amount of First Lien Notes that ultimately must be retired with a cash payment. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, which could result in our being unable to repay indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. A range of economic, competitive, business and industry factors will affect our future financial performance, and many of these factors, such as the economic and financial condition of our industry, the global economy and initiatives of our competitors, are beyond our control. If we do not generate enough cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as:\n\u2022selling assets;\n\u2022reducing or delaying capital investments;\n\u2022seeking to raise additional capital; or\n\u2022restructuring or refinancing all or a portion of our indebtedness at or before maturity.\nWe cannot be assured that we will be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives. The failure to generate sufficient cash flow or to achieve any of these alternatives could materially adversely affect our ability to pay the amounts due under our debt.\nThe indenture dated April 30, 2021 (the \"Indenture\") governing the First Lien Notes contains operating and financial restrictions that restrict our business and financing activities and could limit our growth.\nThe primary restrictive covenants contained in the Indenture governing the First Lien Notes limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness or issue certain types of preferred shares;\n\u2022sell or convey certain assets;\n\u2022make loans to or investments in others;\n\u2022enter into mergers;\n\u2022engage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022make certain payments;\n\u2022incur liens; and\n\u2022pay dividends or repurchase Common Shares.\nAs a result of these restrictive covenants, we will be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities, take advantage of business opportunities or finance future operations or capital needs. A failure to comply with these operating restrictions, as well as the other financial covenants under the First Lien Notes, would result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, would cause some or all of our indebtedness to become immediately due and payable and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn April 30, 2021, we emerged from bankruptcy, which may adversely affect our business and relationships.\nOur having filed for bankruptcy and our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases on April 30, 2021 may adversely affect our business and relationships with our vendors, suppliers, service providers, customers, employees and other third-parties. Many risks exist as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases and our emergence, including the following:\n\u2022we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable and sufficient financing to execute our business plan;\n\u2022key suppliers, vendors and customers may, among other things, renegotiate the terms of their agreements with us, attempt to terminate their relationship with us or require financial assurances from us;\n\u2022our ability to renew existing contracts and obtain new contracts on reasonably acceptable terms and conditions may be adversely affected;\n\u2022our ability to attract, motivate and retain key employees and executives may be adversely affected; and\n\u2022competitors may take business away from us, and our ability to compete for new business and attract and retain customers may be negatively impacted.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and reputation. We cannot assure you that having been subject to bankruptcy protection will not adversely affect our operations in the future.\nOur actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy may not be comparable to our projections filed with the Bankruptcy Court in the course of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nIn connection with the disclosure statement we filed with the Bankruptcy Court and the hearing to consider confirmation of the plan of reorganization, we prepared projected financial information to demonstrate to the Bankruptcy Court the feasibility of the plan of reorganization and our ability to continue operations upon our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases. Those projections were prepared solely for the purpose of the Chapter 11 Cases and have not been and will not be updated and should not be relied upon by investors. At the time they were prepared, the projections reflected numerous assumptions concerning our anticipated future performance with respect to then prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions that were and remain beyond our control and that may not materialize. We have not updated the projections prepared solely for the purpose of our Chapter 11 Cases or the assumptions on which they were based after our emergence. Projections are inherently subject to substantial and numerous uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks, and the assumptions underlying the projections or valuation estimates may prove to be wrong in material respects. Actual results may vary significantly from those contemplated by the projections. As a result, investors should not rely on these projections.\nOur historical financial information will not be indicative of future financial performance as a result of the implementation of the plan of reorganization and the related transactions, as well as our application of fresh start accounting following emergence.\nOur capital structure was significantly impacted by the plan of reorganization. Under fresh start accounting rules that we applied on the Effective Date, assets and liabilities were adjusted to fair values and our accumulated deficit was reset to zero. Accordingly, as a result of the application of fresh start accounting, our financial condition and results of operations following emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases are not comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements on or prior to the Effective Date.\nThe exercise of all or any number of outstanding warrants or the issuance of stock-based awards may dilute the holders of our Common Shares.\nOn the Effective Date, we issued 75,000,000 Common Shares and 5,645,161 warrants to purchase 5,645,161 Common Shares at an exercise price of $131.88 per share, exercisable for a seven year period commencing on that date. Additionally, on May 3, 2021, our board of directors approved and ratified the Valaris Limited 2021 Management Incentive Plan (the \u201cMIP\u201d) and reserved 8,960,573 of our Common Shares for issuance under the MIP primarily for employees and directors. The grant and vesting of equity awards in the future, any exercise of the warrants into Common Shares and any sale of Common Shares underlying outstanding warrants would have a dilutive effect to the holdings of our existing shareholders and could have an adverse effect on the market for our Common Shares, including the price that an investor could obtain for their Common Shares.\nESG Risks\nRegulation of greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business.\nGovernments around the world are increasingly focused on enacting laws and regulations regarding climate change and regulation of greenhouse gases. Lawmakers and regulators in the U.S. and the jurisdictions where we operate have proposed or enacted regulations requiring reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and the restriction thereof, including increased fuel efficiency standards, carbon taxes or cap and trade systems, restrictive permitting, and incentives for renewable energy. In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues and impose reductions of hydrocarbon-based fuels, including plans developed in connection with the Paris climate conference in December 2015, the Katowice climate conference in December 2018 and the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference in November 2021.\nLaws or regulations incentivizing or mandating the use of alternative energy sources such as wind power and solar energy have also been enacted in certain jurisdictions. Additionally, numerous large cities globally and several countries have adopted programs to mandate or incentivize the conversion from internal combustion engine powered vehicles to electric-powered vehicles and placed restrictions on non-public transportation. Such policies or other laws, regulations, treaties and international agreements related to greenhouse gases and climate change may negatively impact the price of oil relative to other energy sources, reduce demand for hydrocarbons, limit drilling in the offshore oil and gas industry, or otherwise unfavorably impact our business, our suppliers and our customers, and result in increased compliance costs and additional operating restrictions, all of which would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition to potential impacts on our business resulting from climate-change legislation or regulations, our business also could be negatively affected by climate-change related physical changes or changes in weather patterns. An increase in severe weather patterns could result in damages to or loss of our drilling rigs, impact our ability to conduct our operations and/or result in a disruption of our customers\u2019 operations. Finally, increasing attention to the risks of climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of lawsuits or investigations brought by public and private entities against oil and natural gas companies in connection with their greenhouse gas emissions. Should we be targeted by any such litigation or investigations, we may incur liability, which could be imposed without regard to the causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. The ultimate impact of greenhouse gas emissions-related agreements, legislation and measures on our company\u2019s financial performance is highly uncertain because we are unable to predict with certainty, for a multitude of individual jurisdictions, the outcome of political decision-making processes and the variables and trade-offs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes.\nConsumer preferences for alternative fuels and electric-powered vehicles, as part of the global energy transition, may lead to reduced demand for our services.\nThe increasing penetration of renewable energy into the energy supply mix, the increased production of electric-powered vehicles and improvements in energy storage, as well as changes in consumer preferences, including increased consumer demand for alternative fuels, energy sources and electric-powered vehicles may affect the demand for oil and natural gas and our drilling services. This evolving transition of the global energy system from fossil-based systems of energy production and consumption to more renewable energy sources, commonly referred to as the energy transition, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. As a result of changes in consumer preferences and uncertainty regarding the pace of the energy transition and expected impacts on oil and natural gas demand, some of our customers are transitioning their businesses to renewable energy projects and away from oil and natural gas exploration and production, which could result in reduced capital spending by such customers on oil and natural gas projects and in turn reduced demand for our services.\nIncreased scrutiny from stakeholders and others regarding climate change, as well as our ESG practices and reporting responsibilities, could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our business and reputation.\nIn recent years the investment community, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth, pension and endowment funds, has promoted the divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressured lenders to cease or limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Such initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and decarbonization could ultimately interfere with our business activities and operations and our access to capital.\nIn addition to such initiatives, ESG matters more generally have been the subject of increased focus by investors, investment funds and other market and industry participants, as well as certain regulators, including in the U.S. and the EU. We publish an annual Sustainability Report, which includes disclosure of our ESG practices and goals. We published our 2020 Sustainability Report in September 2021. Our disclosures on these matters, a failure\nto meet these goals or evolving stakeholder expectations for ESG practices and reporting may potentially harm our reputation and impact employee retention, customer relationships and access to capital. For example, certain market participants use third-party benchmarks or scores to measure a company\u2019s ESG practices in making investment decisions and customers and suppliers may evaluate our ESG practices or require that we adopt certain ESG policies as a condition of awarding contracts. By electing to set and share publicly our corporate ESG standards, our business may also face increased scrutiny related to ESG activities. As ESG best-practices and reporting standards continue to develop, we may incur increased costs related to ESG monitoring and reporting and complying with ESG initiatives. In addition, it may be difficult or expensive for us to comply with any ESG-linked contracting policies adopted by customers and suppliers, particularly given the complexity of our supply chain and our reliance on third-party manufacturers.\nRegulatory, Legal and Tax Risks\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery statutes could result in fines, criminal penalties, drilling contract terminations and an adverse effect on our business.\nWe operate in a number of countries throughout the world, including countries known to have a reputation for corruption and are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") regulations, the U.K. Bribery Act (\"UKBA\"), other U.S. laws and regulations governing our international operations and similar laws in other countries.\nIn August 2017, one of our Brazilian subsidiaries was contacted by the Office of the Attorney General for the Brazilian state of Paran\u00e1 in connection with a criminal investigation procedure initiated against agents of both Samsung Heavy Industries, a shipyard in South Korea (\u201cSHI\u201d), and Pride International LLC (\"Pride\") in relation to the drilling services agreement with Petrobras for the DS-5 (the \"DSA\"). The Brazilian authorities requested information regarding our compliance program and the findings of our internal investigations relating to the DSA. We cooperated with the Office of the Attorney General and provided documents in response to its request. We cannot predict the scope or ultimate outcome of this procedure or whether any Brazilian governmental authority will open an investigation into Pride\u2019s involvement in this matter, or if a proceeding were opened, the scope or ultimate outcome of any such investigation.\nAny violation of the FCPA, OFAC regulations, the UKBA or other applicable anti-corruption laws by us, our affiliated entities or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents could in some cases provide a customer with termination rights and other remedies under the terms of their contracts(s) with us and also result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions and could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results or cash flows. Further, we may incur significant costs and consume significant internal resources in our efforts to detect, investigate and resolve actual or alleged violations.\nIncreasing regulatory complexity could adversely impact the costs associated with our offshore drilling operations and reduce demand.\nThe offshore contract drilling industry is dependent on demand for services from the oil and gas industry. Accordingly, we will be directly affected by the approval and adoption of laws and regulations limiting or curtailing exploration and development drilling for oil and natural gas for economic, environmental, safety and other policy reasons. Furthermore, we may be required to make significant capital expenditures or incur substantial additional costs to comply with new governmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that legislative and regulatory activity could adversely affect our operations by limiting drilling opportunities or significantly increasing our operating costs. Increases in regulatory requirements could significantly increase our costs. In recent years, we have seen several significant regulatory changes that have affected the way we operate in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters.\u201d\nAny new or additional regulatory, legislative, permitting or certification requirements in the U.S., including laws and regulations that have or may impose increased financial responsibility, oil spill abatement contingency plan capability requirements, or additional operational requirements and certifications, could materially adversely affect our financial position, operating results or cash flows.\nWe anticipate that government regulation in other countries where we operate may follow the U.S. in regard to enhanced safety and environmental regulation, which could also result in governments imposing sanctions on contractors when operators fail to comply with regulations that impact drilling operations. Even if not a requirement in these countries, most international operating companies, and many others, are voluntarily complying with some or all of the U.S. inspections and safety and environmental guidelines when operating outside the U.S. Such additional governmental regulation and voluntary compliance by operators could increase the cost of our operations and expose us to greater liability.\nCompliance with or breach of environmental laws can be costly and could limit our operations.\nOur operations are subject to laws and regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, pollution, contamination and hazardous waste disposal or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Environmental laws and regulations specifically applicable to our business activities could impose significant liability on us for damages, clean-up costs, fines and penalties in the event of oil spills or similar discharges of pollutants or contaminants into the environment or improper disposal of hazardous waste generated in the course of our operations. To date, such laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our operating results, and we have not experienced an accident that has exposed us to material liability arising out of or relating to discharges of pollutants into the environment. However, the legislative, judicial and regulatory response to a well incident could substantially increase our and our customers' liabilities. In addition to potential increased liabilities, such legislative, judicial or regulatory action could impose increased financial, insurance or other requirements that may adversely impact the entire offshore drilling industry. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters.\u201d\nESG initiatives and high profile and catastrophic events, including the 2010 Macondo well incident, have increased the regulation of offshore oil and gas drilling. We are adversely affected by restrictions on drilling in certain areas in which we operate, including policies and guidelines regarding the approval of drilling permits, restrictions on development and production activities, and directives and regulations that have and may further impact our operations. From time to time, legislative and regulatory proposals have been introduced that would materially limit or prohibit offshore drilling in certain areas, or that would increase the liabilities or costs associated with offshore drilling. If new laws are enacted, or if government actions are taken that restrict or prohibit offshore drilling in our principal areas of operation or that impose environmental or other requirements that materially increase the liabilities, financial requirements or operating or equipment costs associated with offshore drilling, exploration, development, or production of oil and natural gas, our financial position, operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nThe IRS may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes.\nAlthough Valaris Limited is incorporated in Bermuda (and thus would generally be considered a \u201cforeign\u201d corporation (or non-U.S. tax resident)), the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) may assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and U.S. tax resident) pursuant to the rules under Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code. While we do not believe we are a U.S. corporation pursuant to these rules, the rules are complex and the determination is subject to factual uncertainties. If the IRS successfully challenged our status as a foreign corporation, significant adverse tax consequences would result for us and for certain of our shareholders.\nU.S. tax laws and IRS guidance could affect our ability to engage in certain acquisition strategies and certain internal restructurings.\nEven if we are currently treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code and U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, including temporary Treasury Regulations, may adversely affect our ability to engage in certain future acquisitions of U.S. businesses in exchange for our equity, which may affect the tax efficiencies that otherwise might be achieved in such potential future transactions.\nGovernments may pass laws that subject us to additional taxation or may challenge our tax positions.\nThere is increasing uncertainty with respect to tax laws, regulations and treaties, and the interpretation and enforcement thereof that may affect our business. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) has issued its final reports on base erosion and profit shifting, which generally focus on situations where profits are earned in low-tax jurisdictions, or payments are made between affiliates from jurisdictions with high tax rates to jurisdictions with lower tax rates. Certain countries within which we operate have recently enacted changes to their tax laws in response to the OECD recommendations or otherwise and these and other countries may enact changes to their tax laws or practices in the future (prospectively or retroactively), which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or cash flows. U.S. federal income tax reform legislation enacted in late 2017 introduced significant changes to U.S. income tax law, including a reduction in the statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income, a base erosion anti-abuse tax that effectively imposes a minimum tax on certain payments to non-U.S. affiliates, new and revised rules relating to the current taxation of certain income of foreign subsidiaries and revised rules associated with limitations on the deduction of interest.\nIn addition, our tax positions are subject to audit by U.K., U.S. and other foreign tax authorities. Such tax authorities may disagree with our interpretations or assessments of the effects of tax laws, treaties or regulations or their applicability to our corporate structure or certain transactions we have undertaken. Even if we are successful in maintaining our tax positions, we may incur significant expenses in defending our positions and contesting claims asserted by tax authorities. If we are unsuccessful in defending our tax positions, the resulting assessments or rulings could significantly impact our consolidated income taxes in past or future periods.\nAs required by law, we file periodic tax returns that are subject to review and examination by various revenue agencies within the jurisdictions in which we operate. We are currently subject to tax assessments in various jurisdictions, which we are contesting.\nAs a result of these uncertainties, as well as changes in the administrative practices and precedents of tax authorities or other matters (such as changes in applicable accounting rules) that increase the amounts we have provided for income taxes or deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, we cannot provide any assurances as to what our consolidated effective income tax rate will be in future periods. If we are unable to mitigate the negative consequences of any change in law, audit or other matters, this could cause our consolidated income taxes to increase and cause a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or cash flows.\nOur consolidated effective income tax rate may vary substantially over time.\nWe cannot provide any assurances as to what our future consolidated effective income tax rate will be because of, among other matters, uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of our business activities in any particular jurisdiction in the future and the tax laws of such jurisdictions, as well as potential changes in U.K., U.S. and other foreign tax laws, regulations or treaties or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, changes in the administrative practices and precedents of tax authorities or other matters (such as changes in applicable accounting rules) that increase the amounts we have provided for income taxes or deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, as a result of frequent changes in the taxing jurisdictions in which our drilling rigs are operated and/or owned, changes in the overall level of our income and changes in tax laws, our consolidated effective income tax rate may vary substantially from one reporting period to another. In periods of declining profitability, our income tax expense may not decline proportionately with income. Further, we may continue to incur income tax expense in periods in which we operate at a loss. Income tax rates imposed in the tax jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries conduct operations vary, as does the tax base to which the rates are applied. In some cases, tax rates may be applicable to gross revenues, statutory or negotiated deemed profits or other bases utilized under local tax laws, rather than to net income. In some instances, the movement of drilling rigs among taxing jurisdictions will involve the transfer of ownership of the drilling rigs among our subsidiaries. If we are unable to mitigate the negative consequences of any change in law, audit, business activity or other matters, this could cause our consolidated effective income tax rate to increase and cause a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or cash flows.\nWe are a Bermuda company and it may be difficult to enforce judgments against us or our directors and executive officers.\nWe are a Bermuda exempted company. As a result, the rights of holders of our Common Shares are governed by Bermuda law and our memorandum of association and bye-laws. The rights of shareholders under Bermuda law may differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions. Some of our directors and officers are not residents of the United States, and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process on those persons in the United States or to enforce in the United States judgments obtained in U.S. courts against us or those persons based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws. It is doubtful whether courts in Bermuda will enforce judgments obtained in other jurisdictions, including the United States, against us or our directors or officers under the securities laws of those jurisdictions or entertain actions in Bermuda against us or our directors or officers under the securities laws of other jurisdictions.\nOur bye-laws restrict shareholders from bringing legal action against our officers and directors.\nOur bye-laws contain a broad waiver by our shareholders of any claim or right of action, both individually and on our behalf, against any of our officers or directors. The waiver applies to any action taken by an officer or director, or the failure of an officer or director to take any action, in the performance of his or her duties, except with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the officer or director. This waiver limits the right of shareholders to assert claims against our officers and directors unless the act or failure to act involves fraud or dishonesty.\nProvisions in our bye-laws could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our Common Shares.\nThe existence of some provisions in our bye-laws could delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a shareholder may consider favorable, which could adversely affect the price of our Common Shares. Certain provisions of our bye-laws could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of our company, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions include:\n\u2022authority of our board to determine its size;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred shares without shareholder approval;\n\u2022limitations on the removal of directors; and\n\u2022limitations on the ability of our shareholders to act by written consent in lieu of a meeting.\nIn addition, our bye-laws establish advance notice provisions for shareholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of shareholders.\nOur business could be affected as a result of activist investors.\nPublicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by activist investors advocating corporate actions such as actions related to ESG matters, financial restructuring, increased borrowing, dividends, share repurchases or sales of assets or even the entire company. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by such activist investors or others in the future could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of investor activism or changes to the composition of the Board of Directors may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business, instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. If customers choose to delay, defer or reduce transactions with us or transact with our competitors instead of us because of any such issues, then our revenue, earnings and operating cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, the trading price of our shares could experience periods of increased volatility as a result of investor activism.\nRisks Related to Our International Operations\nOur non-U.S. operations involve additional risks not typically associated with U.S. operations.\nRevenues from non-U.S. operations were 87%, 81%, 83% and 85% of our total consolidated revenues during eight months ended December 31, 2021 (Successor), four months ended April 30, 2021 (Predecessor), year-ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (Predecessor), respectively. Our non-U.S. operations and shipyard rig construction and enhancement projects are subject to political, economic and other uncertainties, including:\n\u2022terrorist acts, war and civil disturbances,\n\u2022expropriation, nationalization, deprivation or confiscation of our equipment or our customer's property,\n\u2022repudiation or nationalization of contracts,\n\u2022assaults on property or personnel,\n\u2022piracy, kidnapping and extortion demands,\n\u2022significant governmental influence over many aspects of local economies and customers,\n\u2022unexpected changes in law and regulatory requirements, including changes in interpretation or enforcement of existing laws,\n\u2022work stoppages, often due to strikes over which we have little or no control,\n\u2022complications associated with repairing and replacing equipment in remote locations,\n\u2022limitations on insurance coverage, such as war risk coverage, in certain areas,\n\u2022imposition of trade barriers,\n\u2022wage and price controls,\n\u2022import-export quotas,\n\u2022exchange restrictions,\n\u2022currency fluctuations,\n\u2022changes in monetary policies,\n\u2022uncertainty or instability resulting from hostilities or other crises in the Middle East, West Africa, Latin America, Southeastern Asia or other geographic areas in which we operate,\n\u2022changes in the manner or rate of taxation,\n\u2022limitations on our ability to recover amounts due,\n\u2022increased risk of government and vendor/supplier corruption,\n\u2022increased local content requirements,\n\u2022the occurrence or threat of epidemic or pandemic diseases (including the COVID-19 pandemic) and any government response to such occurrence or threat,\n\u2022changes in political conditions, and\n\u2022other forms of government regulation and economic conditions that are beyond our control.\nWe historically have maintained insurance coverage and obtained contractual indemnities that protect us from some, but not all, of the risks associated with our non-U.S. operations such as nationalization, deprivation, expropriation, confiscation, political and war risks. However, there can be no assurance that any particular type of contractual or insurance protection will be available in the future or that we will be able to purchase our desired level of insurance coverage at commercially feasible rates. Moreover, we may initiate a self-insurance program through one or more captive insurance subsidiaries. In circumstances where we have insurance protection for some or all of the risks associated with non-U.S. operations, such insurance may be subject to cancellation on short notice, and it is unlikely that we would be able to remove our rig or rigs from the affected area within the notice period. Accordingly, a significant event for which we are uninsured, underinsured or self-insured, or for which we have not received an enforceable contractual indemnity from a customer, could cause a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or cash flows.\nWe are subject to various tax laws and regulations in substantially all countries in which we operate or have a legal presence. Actions by tax authorities that impact our business structures and operating strategies, such as changes to tax treaties, laws and regulations, or the interpretation or repeal of any of the foregoing or changes in the administrative practices and precedents of tax authorities, adverse rulings in connection with audits or otherwise, or other challenges may have a material impact on our tax expense.\nAs required by law, we file periodic tax returns that are subject to review and examination by various revenue agencies within the jurisdictions in which we operate. We are currently subject to tax assessments in various jurisdictions, which we are contesting. Although the outcome of such assessments cannot be predicted with certainty, unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.\nOur non-U.S. operations also face the risk of fluctuating currency values, which may impact our revenues, operating costs and capital expenditures. We currently conduct contract drilling operations in certain countries that have experienced substantial fluctuations in the value of their currency compared to the U.S. dollar. In addition, some of the countries in which we operate have enacted exchange controls. Generally, we have contractually mitigated these risks by invoicing and receiving payment in U.S. dollars (our functional currency) or freely convertible currency and, to the extent possible, by limiting our acceptance of foreign currency to amounts which approximate our expenditure requirements in such currencies. However, not all of our contracts contain these terms and there is no assurance that our contracts will contain such terms in the future.\nA portion of the costs and expenditures incurred by our non-U.S. operations, including certain capital expenditures, are settled in local currencies, exposing us to risks associated with fluctuation in the value of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. We have historically used foreign currency forward contracts to reduce this exposure in certain cases. However, a relative weakening in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the local currencies in these countries may increase our costs and expenditures.\nOur non-U.S. operations are also subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to the operation of drilling rigs and the requirements for equipment. We may be required to make significant capital expenditures to operate in such countries, which may not be reimbursed by our customers. Governments in some countries are active in regulating and controlling the ownership of oil, natural gas and mineral concessions and companies holding such concessions, the exploration of oil and natural gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industry in their countries. In some areas of the world, government activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work performed by major international oil companies and may continue to do so. Moreover, certain countries accord preferential treatment to local contractors or joint ventures or impose specific quotas for local goods and services, which can increase our operational costs and place us at a competitive disadvantage. There can be no assurance that such laws and regulations or activities will not have a material adverse effect on our future operations.\nThe shipment of goods, services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import activities are governed by specific customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. Moreover, many countries, including the United States, control the export and re-export of certain goods, services and technology and impose related export recordkeeping and reporting obligations. Governments also may impose express or de facto economic sanctions against certain countries, persons and other entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities.\nThe laws and regulations concerning import activity, export recordkeeping and reporting, export control and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing. These laws and regulations may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner materially impacting our operations. Shipments can be delayed and denied export or entry for a variety of reasons, some of which are outside our control and some of which may result from failure to comply with existing legal and regulatory regimes. Shipping delays or denials could cause unscheduled operational downtime, reduced day rates during such downtime and contract cancellations. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory trading obligations also could result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions, such as fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government contracts, seizure of shipments and loss of import and export privileges.\nOur employees, contractors and agents may take actions in violation of our policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or cash flows.\nLegislation enacted in Bermuda as to Economic Substance may affect our operations.\nPursuant to the Economic Substance Act 2018 (as amended) of Bermuda (the \u201cES Act\u201d) that came into force on January 1, 2019, a registered entity other than an entity which is resident for tax purposes in certain jurisdictions outside Bermuda (\u201cnon-resident entity\u201d) that carries on as a business any one or more of the \u201crelevant\nactivities\u201d referred to in the ES Act must comply with economic substance requirements. The ES Act may require in-scope Bermuda entities which are engaged in such \u201crelevant activities\u201d to be directed and managed in Bermuda, have an adequate level of qualified employees in Bermuda, incur an adequate level of annual expenditure in Bermuda, maintain physical offices and premises in Bermuda or perform core income-generating activities in Bermuda. The list of \u201crelevant activities\u201d includes carrying on any one or more of: banking, insurance, fund management, financing, leasing, headquarters, shipping, distribution and service center, intellectual property and holding entities. The ES Act could affect the manner in which we operate our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.K.'s withdrawal from the E.U. may have a negative effect on economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nOn April 27, 2021, the European Parliament approved the agreement on the terms of the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the E.U. (the \u201cTrade and Cooperation Agreement\u201d), which provides for zero tariffs and quotas on the movement of goods between the U.K. and the E.U. (provided they comply with the parties\u2019 agreed rules of origin) and seeks to minimize trade disruption arising from technical and administrative barriers to trade. However, there can be no guarantee that the ongoing implementation of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement will not lead to significant increased costs and supply chain disruption for our business and the businesses of our U.K. customers and suppliers. Any incremental costs incurred by our U.K. suppliers may be passed on to us and any supply chain disruption experienced by our U.K. customers or suppliers may in turn disrupt our own operations.\nThe U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the E.U. has also given rise to calls for the governments of other E.U. member states to consider withdrawal, while the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal negotiation process has increased the risk of the possibility of a further referendum concerning Scotland\u2019s independence from the rest of the U.K. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global, regional and/or national economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global market liquidity.\nThe implementation of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and/or any subsequent divergence of the law applicable in the U.K. and the E.U. could depress economic activity, result in changes to currency exchange rates, taxes, import/export regulations, laws and other regulatory matters, and/or restrict our access to capital and the free movement of our employees, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or cash flows. Approximately 22% and 19% of our total revenues were generated in the U.K. for the eight months ended December 31, 2021 (Successor) and four months ended April 30, 2021 (Predecessor), respectively.", "PERMNO": 62519, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "VALPQ"}
