Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and related notes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. In addition, the impact of COVID-19 and any worsening of the economic environment may exacerbate the risks described below, any of which could have a material impact on us. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.\nSummary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that you should consider before investing in our common stock. These risks are described more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risks relating to the following:\n\uf0b7Limited operating history and lack of revenue producing operations\n\uf0b7Lack of product revenue\n\uf0b7Our ability to obtain sufficient funding\n\uf0b7Our ability to comply with covenants under our indebtedness\n\uf0b7Fluctuation of our operating results\n\uf0b7Competition within our industry\n\uf0b7Health epidemics, including the coronavirus pandemic\n\uf0b7Reliance on third parties\n\uf0b7Loss of key management personnel\n\uf0b7Security breaches, loss of data, and other disruptions to us or our third-party service providers that could compromise sensitive information\n\uf0b7Potential product liability lawsuits and other litigation\n\uf0b7Timing, unpredictability, and expense of clinical development process\n\uf0b7Trial results and changes in trial data\n\uf0b7Failure to obtain and maintain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals\n\uf0b7Determination and validation of the mechanism of action of our NPS technology platform\n\uf0b7Safety and effectiveness of our product candidates, and potential adverse side effects\n\uf0b7Failure to obtain broad adoption of our CellFX System and NPS technology\n\uf0b7Enrollment of patients in our clinical trials\n\uf0b7Ability to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement by Medicare and other third-party payers\n\uf0b7Protection of intellectual property, potential litigation related to intellectual property, and obligations under intellectual property agreements\n\uf0b7Stringent domestic and foreign regulation in respect of any potential devices and products, including healthcare laws and regulations\n\uf0b7Healthcare policy changes\n\uf0b7Volatility of the price of our common stock\n\uf0b7Concentration of ownership by our principal stockholder and Chairman of our board of directors, Robert W. Duggan\n\uf0b7Unfavorable global economic or political conditions\n\uf0b7Material weaknesses and maintenance of an effective system of internal control over financial reporting\nRisks Relating to Our Business, Industry and Financial Condition\nSince we have a limited operating history and have not commenced any revenue producing operations, it is difficult to evaluate the future of our business.\nWe are a bioelectric medicine technology company and have not yet commenced revenue-producing operations. To date, our operations on a consolidated basis have consisted of the continued development and clinical studies of our technologies and implementation of the early parts of our business plan. We have incurred significant operating losses in each year since our inception and we may continue to incur additional losses for the next several years. In addition, a high percentage of our expenses will continue to be fixed; accordingly, our losses may be greater than expected and our operating results may suffer. We have limited historical financial data upon which we may base our projected revenue and base our planned operating expenses. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our technology or prospective operations and business prospects.\nWe currently have no product revenue and may never become profitable.\nTo date, we have not generated revenue and have historically relied on financing from the sale of equity securities to fund our operations. We expect that our future financial results will depend primarily on our success in launching, selling, and supporting our therapies and treatments utilizing our CellFX System or other products based on our NPS technology. We expect to expend significant resources on hiring of personnel, continued scientific and product research and development, potential product testing and pre-clinical and clinical investigation, intellectual property development and prosecution, marketing and promotion, capital expenditures, working capital, general and administrative expenses, and fees and expenses associated with our capital raising efforts. We expect to incur costs and expenses related to consulting costs, laboratory development costs, hiring of scientists, engineers, sales representatives, and other operational personnel, and the continued development of relationships with potential partners. We are incurring significant operating losses, we expect to continue to incur additional losses for at least the next several years, and we cannot assure you that we will generate revenue or be profitable in the future. There are no assurances that our future products will be cleared or approved or become commercially viable or accepted for use. Even with commercially viable applications of our technology, which may include licensing, we may never recover our research and development expenses.\nInvestment in medical technology is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product will fail to demonstrate adequate efficacy or clinical utility. Investors should evaluate an investment in us in light of the uncertainties encountered by developing medical technology companies in a competitive environment. There can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that we will ultimately be able to achieve profitability. Even if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could significantly impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, or continue to implement our business plan.\nIf we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, we may be unable to execute our business plan and fund operations. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Our existing indebtedness, as well as any future indebtedness, has resulted in and may result in increased fixed payment obligations and certain covenants.\nWe have experienced operating losses, and we may continue to incur operating losses for the next several years as we implement our business plan. Currently, we have no revenue and, although we have received funding in the form of a loan from Robert W. Duggan, Chairman of our board of directors, and also implemented an at-the-market equity offering program, do\nnot have arrangements in place for all the anticipated financing that would be required to fully implement our business plan. Our prior losses combined with expected future losses, have had, and will continue to have, for the foreseeable future, an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nWe will need to raise additional capital in order to continue to execute our business plan. There is no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or that management will be able to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional funds, we will have to scale back our operations. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and resulting negative impact on the global macroeconomic environment and capital markets may make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds. We have incurred and may further incur additional debt, including the debt recently incurred through the entry into a term loan agreement (Loan Agreement) with Mr. Duggan, for a loan from Mr. Duggan to us of an aggregate principal amount of $41 million. We may not have sufficient cash to make required payments under the terms of this debt, and, should this occur, debt holders have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets.\nWe cannot give any assurance that we will be able to obtain all the necessary funding that we may need. In addition, we believe that we will require additional capital in the future to fully develop our technologies and planned products, or other future products to commercial launch. We have pursued and may pursue additional funding through various financing sources, including the private sale of our equity securities, debt financings, our an at-the-market equity offering program, licensing fees for our technology, joint ventures with capital partners, and project type financing. If we raise funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, dilution to some or all our stockholders will result. Any equity securities issued may also provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. We also may seek government-based financing, such as development and research grants. There can be no assurance that funds will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nOur existing indebtedness has resulted in increased fixed payment obligations, and has imposed certain covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt. Any future indebtedness could further increase our fixed payment obligations and could impose additional covenants, including, further limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to issue additional equity, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights, and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. In addition, the issuance of additional equity securities by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the event that we enter into collaborations or licensing arrangements to raise capital, we may be required to accept unfavorable terms. These agreements may require that we relinquish, or license to a third party on unfavorable terms, our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves or reserve certain opportunities for future potential arrangements when we might otherwise be able to achieve more favorable terms. In addition, we may be forced to work with a partner on one or more of our products or market development programs, which could lower the economic value of those programs to us.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, we may terminate or delay the development of one or more of our products, delay clinical trials necessary to market our products, or delay establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities necessary to commercialize our products. If this were to occur, our ability to grow and support our business and to respond to market challenges could be significantly limited or we may be unable to continue operations, in which case you could lose your entire investment.\nOur outstanding Loan Agreement contains covenants that may limit our operating flexibility.\nOur Loan Agreement with Mr. Duggan subjects us to certain affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on our ability to transfer or dispose of assets, merge with or acquire other companies, and incur additional indebtedness and liens. As a result of these covenants, we have certain limitations on the manner in which we can conduct our business, and we may be restricted from engaging in favorable business activities or financing future operations or capital needs until our current debt obligations are paid in full or we obtain the consent of Mr. Duggan, which we may not be able to obtain. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow or revenue to pay the principal and interest on our debt. In addition, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Loan Agreement, Mr. Duggan, among other things, can declare all indebtedness due and payable immediately, which would adversely impact our liquidity and reduce the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. These fluctuations may occur due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including:\n\uf0b7the timing and cost of, and level of investment in, research, development, and commercialization activities relating to our product and product candidates, which may change from time to time;\n\uf0b7the timing of receipt of approvals or clearances for our product candidates from regulatory authorities in the U.S. or internationally;\n\uf0b7the timing and status of enrollment for our clinical trials;\n\uf0b7coverage and reimbursement policies with respect to our product and product candidates, including the degree to which treatments using our products are covered and receive adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, and potential future drugs or devices that compete with our products;\n\uf0b7the cost of manufacturing our product, as well as building out our supply chain, which may vary depending on the quantity of production and the terms of our agreements with manufacturers;\n\uf0b7expenditures that we may incur to acquire, develop or commercialize additional product candidates and technologies;\n\uf0b7the level of demand for our product and any product candidates, if approved or cleared, which may vary significantly over time;\n\uf0b7litigation, including patent, employment, securities class action, stockholder derivative, general commercial, and other lawsuits;\n\uf0b7future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; and\n\uf0b7the timing and success or failure of nonclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates or competing product candidates, or any other change in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our competitors or partners.\nThe cumulative effects of these factors could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Investors should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.\nThis variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated revenue or earnings guidance we may provide.\nWe expect to operate in a highly competitive market, we may face competition from large, well-established medical technology, device and product manufacturers with significant resources, and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe medical technology, medical device, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense and dynamic competition to develop new technologies and proprietary therapies. We face competition from a number of sources, such as pharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, generic drug companies, biotechnology companies, and academic and research institutions. We may find ourselves in competition with companies that have competitive advantages over us, such as:\n\uf0b7significantly greater name recognition;\n\uf0b7established relations with healthcare professionals, customers, and third-party payers;\n\uf0b7greater efficacy or better safety profiles;\n\uf0b7established distribution networks;\n\uf0b7additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates, higher discounts, or incentives to gain a competitive advantage;\n\uf0b7greater experience in obtaining patents and regulatory approvals for product candidates and other resources;\n\uf0b7greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval for products, and marketing approved products; and\n\uf0b7greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing, and patent litigation.\nWe may also face increased competition in the future as new companies enter our markets and as scientific developments surrounding electro-signaling therapeutics continue to accelerate. While we will seek to expand our technological capabilities to remain competitive, research and development by others may render our technology or product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive or result in treatments or cures superior to any therapy developed by us. In addition, certain of our product candidates may compete with other dermatological products, including over the counter (OTC) treatments, for a share of some patients\u2019 discretionary budgets and for physicians\u2019 attention within their clinical practices. Even if a generic product or an OTC product is less effective than our product candidates, a less effective generic or OTC product may be more quickly adopted by physicians and patients than our competing product candidates based upon cost or convenience. As a result, we may not be able to compete effectively against current and potential future competitors or their devices and products.\nWe may rely on third parties for our sales, marketing, manufacturing and/or distribution, and these third parties may not perform satisfactorily.\nTo be able to commercialize our planned products, we may elect to internally develop aspects of sales, marketing, large-scale manufacturing, or distribution, or we may elect to utilize third parties with respect to one or more of these items. Our reliance on these third parties may reduce our control over these activities; however, reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our responsibility to ensure compliance with all required legal, regulatory, and scientific standards. These third parties may be adversely impacted by COVID-19 which could affect their ability to perform satisfactorily. Any failure of these third parties to perform satisfactorily and in compliance with relevant laws and regulations could lead to delays in the development of our planned products, including delays in our clinical trials, or failure to obtain regulatory approval for our planned products, or failure to successfully commercialize our planned products or other future products. Some of these events could be the basis for FDA or other regulatory action, including injunction, recall, seizure, or total or partial suspension of production.\nWe have not yet commenced revenue-producing operations and may be unsuccessful in earning revenues. We believe that developing the commercialization aspects of a company will take a substantial amount of capital and commitment of time and effort. We may seek development and marketing partners and license our technology to others in order to avoid our having to provide the marketing, manufacturing, and distribution capabilities within our organization. There can be no assurance that we will find any development and marketing partners or companies that are interested in licensing our technology. If we are unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution capabilities, independently or with others, we will not be able to generate product revenue, and may not become profitable.\nIf we lose key management personnel, our ability to identify, develop and commercialize new or next generation product candidates will be impaired, could result in loss of markets or market share and could make us less competitive.\nWe are highly dependent upon the principal members of our management team, including our Chief Executive Officer, Darrin Uecker, and members of our finance, sales, marketing, scientific, and engineering teams. These persons have significant experience and knowledge with sub-microsecond pulsed electric fields and more broadly in aesthetics, dermatology, life sciences, and medical technologies. The loss of any team member could impair our ability to design, identify, and develop new intellectual property and new scientific or product ideas. The loss of a key employee, the failure of a key employee to perform in his or her current position, or our inability to attract and retain skilled employees could result in our inability to continue to grow our business or to implement our business strategy. We compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science companies, academic institutions, and research institutions. Our employees could leave our company with little or no prior notice and may be free to work for a competitor. If one or more of our senior executives or other key personnel were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them easily or at all, and other\nsenior management may be required to divert attention from other aspects of the business. In addition, we do not have \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies covering any member of our management team or other key personnel. The loss of any of these individuals or any inability to attract or retain qualified personnel, including scientists, engineers, and others, could prevent us from pursuing collaborations and materially and adversely affect our product development and introductions, business growth prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThere is a limited talent pool of experienced professionals in our industry. If we are not able to retain and recruit personnel with the requisite technical skills, we may be unable to successfully execute our business strategy.\nThe specialized nature of our industry results in an inherent scarcity of experienced personnel in the field. Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, including scientific, technical, commercial, business, regulatory and administrative personnel, necessary to support our anticipated growth, develop our business and perform certain contractual obligations. Given the scarcity of professionals with the scientific knowledge that we require and the competition for qualified personnel among life science businesses, we may not succeed in attracting or retaining the personnel we require to continue and grow our operations.\nRapidly changing technology in life sciences could make the products we are developing obsolete.\nThe life sciences industries are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards. Our future success will depend on our ability to continually develop and then improve the products that we design and to develop and introduce new products that address the evolving needs of our customers on a timely and cost-effective basis. We also will need to pursue new market opportunities that develop as a result of technological and scientific advances. These new market opportunities may be outside the scope of our proven expertise or in areas which have unproven market demand. Any new products developed by us may not be accepted in the intended markets. Our inability to gain market acceptance of new products could harm our future operating results.\nIf we are unable to manage the anticipated growth of our business, our future revenue and operating results may be harmed.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in our business. Recent and future growth imposes significant added responsibilities on management, including the need to identify, recruit, train, and integrate additional employees. Rapid expansion in personnel could mean that less experienced people carry out our research and development activities, manufacture, market, and sell CellFX System and NPS therapies and treatments, which could result in inefficiencies and unanticipated costs, reduced quality, and disruptions to our operations. In addition, rapid and significant growth may strain our administrative and operational infrastructure, and the failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative, operating and financial control systems or the occurrence of unexpected expansion difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to timely execute our business plan. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, it may be difficult for us to execute our business strategy and our business could be harmed.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations relating to personally identifiable information, and maintain other sensitive information. Security breaches, loss of data and other disruptions to us or our third-party service providers could compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we, and our third-party service providers may collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected health information, personally identifiable information about our patients, information related to our trials, intellectual property, and our proprietary business and financial information. We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing a combination of on-site and vendor-owned systems. We face a number of risks related to our protection of, and our service providers\u2019 protection of, this critical information, including loss of access, data, unauthorized disclosure and unauthorized access, as well as risks associated with our ability to identify and audit such events.\nAlthough we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure, or those of our vendors, may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses or otherwise breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other activities. While we believe we have not experienced any such attack or breach, we, and our vendors may be unable to anticipate attacks, to implement adequate preventative or mitigation measures, to identify any attacks or incidents on a timely basis, or to remediate or otherwise address any attacks or incidents in a timely manner. If any such attack or other incident were to occur, our systems and networks would be compromised and the information we store on those systems and networks could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in a loss of intellectual property protection, legal claims or proceedings,\nliability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, such as the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which was enacted in June 2018 and became operative on January 1, 2020, or regulatory penalties, and could require substantial efforts to remediate and otherwise respond to the incident. The CCPA requires covered companies to, among other things, make certain enhanced disclosures related to California residents regarding our use or disclosure of their personal information, allow California residents to opt-out of certain uses and disclosures of their personal information without penalty, provide Californians with other choices related to personal data in our possession, and obtain opt-in consent before engaging in certain uses of personal information relating to Californians under the age of 16. The California Attorney General may seek substantial monetary penalties and injunctive relief in the event of our non-compliance with the CCPA. The CCPA also allows for private lawsuits from Californians in the event of certain data breaches. Certain aspects of the CCPA and its interpretation remain uncertain, and we may need to modify our policies or practices in an effort to comply with it. Moreover, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) was recently approved by California voters, which significantly modifies the CCPA, resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply.\nUnauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also disrupt our operations, including our ability to process tests, provide test results, provide services, conduct research and development activities, collect, process and prepare company financial information, provide information about our product candidates and manage the administrative aspects of our business and could damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any future claim will not be excluded or otherwise be denied coverage by any insurer. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results and reputation.\nIn addition, the interpretation and application of federal and state consumer, health-related and data protection laws in the U.S. are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is, or alleged to be, inconsistent with our practices. If so, this could result in regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, private litigation, claims for damages, and government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, any of which could adversely affect our business. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices, systems and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of our product or any future products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the sale of our product and the future sale of planned products and the use of these in human clinical studies. For example, we may be sued if our product or any of our product candidates, including any that are developed in combination therapies, allegedly causes injury, or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing, or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability, and a breach of warranties. We may also be subject to liability for a misunderstanding of, or inappropriate reliance upon, the information we provide. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product or planned products caused injuries, we may incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\uf0b7decreased demand for our product or any planned products that we may develop;\n\uf0b7injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\uf0b7withdrawal of patients from clinical studies or cancellation of studies;\n\uf0b7significant costs to defend the related litigation and distraction to our management team;\n\uf0b7substantial monetary awards to patients;\n\uf0b7loss of revenue; and\n\uf0b7the inability to commercialize any future products that we may develop.\nFor example, for our clinical trials in the field of oncology, patients with the types and stages of cancer targeted by our NPS technology may already be in severe and advanced stages of disease, may have worsened conditions despite traditional therapies, may not be surgical candidates, and/or may have both known and unknown significant pre-existing and potentially life-threatening conditions. During the course of treatment, patients may suffer adverse events, including death, for reasons that may be related to our CellFX System or our NPS technology. Such events could subject us to costly litigation, require us to pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients, delay, negatively impact, or end our opportunity to receive or maintain regulatory approval to market those products, or require us to suspend or abandon our commercialization efforts. Even in a circumstance in which we do not believe that an adverse event is related to our product, the investigation into the circumstance may be time-consuming or inconclusive. These investigations may interrupt our sales efforts, delay our regulatory approval processes, or impact and limit the type of regulatory approvals our products could receive or maintain. As a result of these factors, a product liability claim, even if successfully defended, could harm our business.\nWe currently maintain product liability insurance coverage, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception and anticipate that we may continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. If not utilized, some of our federal and state net operating losses (NOLs) carryforwards will begin to expire in various years beginning after 2034. Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and certain similar state tax provisions, we are generally allowed to carry forward our NOLs from a prior taxable year to offset our future taxable income, if any, until such NOLs are used or expire, subject to certain limitations. The same is true of other unused tax attributes, such as tax credits.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. We believe that we have had one or more ownership changes, and, as a result, a portion of our existing NOLs may be subject to limitation. Future changes in our stock ownership could result in additional limitations. We may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOLs even if we attain profitability.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, was enacted on March 27, 2020 in the U.S. and provides economic relief, helping to generate liquidity for companies negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Key provisions of the act include delaying certain payroll tax payments, Section 163(j)limitation increases and Section 172(b)(1) NOL carrybacks and carryforwards. The CARES Act modifies the NOL rule to allow for a five-year carryback period for NOLs incurred for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2017, but before Jan. 1, 2021. There has been no material impact to the Company's financial statements as a result of this legislation.\nWe have a substantial amount of goodwill and intangible assets which over time may have to be written down as we make the required periodic assessments as to their value as reflected in our financial statements.\nA significant portion of our total assets are comprised of goodwill and intangibles that arose from our 2014 business acquisitions. We review goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. We also review our intangible assets for impairment at each fiscal year end or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed their current fair values. If we take an impairment charge for either goodwill or intangible assets, the overall assets will be reduced. Such an impairment charge may result in a change in the perceived value of the company and ultimately may be reflected as a reduction in the market price of our securities. Additionally, an impairment charge may also adversely influence our ability to raise capital in the future.\nRisks Related to Product Development\nClinical development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure or delay can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. Success in nonclinical studies and early feasibility clinical studies does not ensure that expanded clinical trials that will be used to support regulatory submissions will be successful. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, nonclinical findings made while clinical trials were underway, and safety\nor efficacy observations made in clinical trials, including previously unreported adverse events. Even if our clinical trials are completed, the results may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval or clearance for our product candidates.\nInterim \u201ctop-line\u201d and preliminary results from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publish interim top-line or preliminary results from our clinical trials. Interim results from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Preliminary or top-line results also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, interim and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects and may cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.\nIf we fail to maintain necessary regulatory clearance for our product, or if clearances or approvals for future devices and indications are delayed or not issued, our commercial operations would be harmed. Additionally, changes in methods of product candidate manufacturing may result in additional costs or delay.\nOur product candidates under development are medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation by FDA in the U.S. and by regulatory agencies in other countries where we plan to do business. Government regulations specific to medical devices are wide-ranging and govern, among other things:\n\uf0b7device design, development and manufacture;\n\uf0b7laboratory, pre-clinical and clinical testing, labeling, packaging, storage and distribution;\n\uf0b7premarketing clearance or approval;\n\uf0b7record keeping;\n\uf0b7device marketing, promotion and advertising, sales and distribution; and\n\uf0b7post-marketing surveillance, including reporting of deaths and serious injuries and recalls and correction and removals.\nBefore a new medical device or a new intended use for, an existing device can be marketed in the U.S., a company must first submit and receive either 510(k) clearance or PMA from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. In the 510(k) clearance process, the FDA will determine that a proposed device is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to a device legally on the market, known as a \u201cpredicate\u201d device, with respect to intended use, technology and safety and effectiveness, in order to clear the proposed device for marketing. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. The PMA pathway requires an applicant to demonstrate reasonable safety and effectiveness of the device based on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trial, manufacturing, and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices. Products that are approved through a PMA application generally need FDA approval before they can be modified. Similarly, some modifications made to products cleared through a 510(k) may require a new 510(k). Either process can be expensive, lengthy and unpredictable.\nIn February 2021, we received a 510(k) clearance from the U.S. FDA for our CellFX System for dermatologic procedures requiring ablation and resurfacing of the skin. Following this general dermatologic indication, we plan to pursue specific indications for the CellFX System, starting with an indication for the treatment of SH lesions. This will require an additional 510(k) submission, as will each subsequent indication, and will likely be based on comparative clinical data.\nHowever, the failure to obtain further 510(k) clearances may add significant time and expense to our regulatory clearance process, may delay our ability to generate revenue, and may have a negative impact on our stock price. We may not be able to obtain the necessary clearances or approvals necessary to market our CellFX System for specific indications or such approvals or clearances may be unduly delayed, which could harm our business. If the FDA rejects our 510(k) submissions for specific indications, we may be required to obtain FDA approval through the de novo pathway, which will require additional time and resources, including the need to conduct more clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of our candidate device.\nThe FDA may not approve or clear, or may delay approval or clearance of, our 510(k), de novo, or PMA applications on a timely basis or at all. Such delays or refusals could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition. The FDA may also change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.\nThe FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also regulate the advertising and promotion of our devices to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances or approvals, that there are adequate and reasonable data to substantiate the claims and that our promotional labeling and advertising is neither false nor misleading in any respect. If the FDA or the FTC determines that any of our advertising or promotional claims are misleading, not substantiated or not permissible, we may be subject to enforcement actions, including FDA warning letters, and we may be required to revise our promotional claims and make other corrections or restitutions.\nFDA and state authorities have broad enforcement powers. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA or state agencies, which may include any of the following sanctions:\n\uf0b7adverse publicity, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, and civil penalties;\n\uf0b7repair, replacement, refunds, recall, or seizure of our devices;\n\uf0b7operating restrictions, partial suspension, or total shutdown of production;\n\uf0b7refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new devices, new intended uses or modifications to existing devices;\n\uf0b7withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted; and\n\uf0b7criminal prosecution.\nIf any of these events were to occur, our business and financial condition would be harmed.\nOur efforts may never demonstrate the feasibility of our technology.\nOur research and development efforts remain subject to all of the risks associated with the development of new technology. Development of the underlying technology, including the development of our CellFX System, may be affected by unanticipated technical or other problems, among other development and research issues, and the possible insufficiency of funds needed in order to complete development of these products or devices. Regulatory and clinical hurdles or challenges also may result in delays and cause us to incur additional expenses that may increase our need for capital and result in additional losses. In addition, the potential indications for our NPS technology are numerous, and we may fail to pursue the most optimal indications. If we cannot complete, or if we experience significant delays in developing our technology, applications or products for use in potential commercial applications, particularly after incurring significant expenditures, our business may fail and investors may lose the entirety of their investment.\nThe mechanism of action of NPS technology platform has not been fully determined or validated.\nThe exact mechanism(s) of action(s) of the NPS technology platform is not fully understood, and data is still being gathered regarding its use. Furthermore, there are only a relatively small number of scientists and researchers who can be considered experts in the use of this emerging technology. A full understanding of our product\u2019s, and any future product\u2019s, mechanism of action and a large scale of scientific experts are typically believed to make product development less risky. The FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities may view this as increasing the potential risks, and diminishing the potential benefits, of products based on NPS technology. In addition, potential partners may view this as a limitation of the program, and it may be more challenging for us to obtain a partnership on favorable terms as a result.\nOur product and any product candidates may cause serious adverse side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial desirability of an approved label or result in significant negative consequences following any marketing approval.\nThe risk of failure of clinical development is high. For example, the vast majority of our in vivo data has been a result of animal testing, and we have only completed a limited number of feasibility studies in humans. It is difficult to predict when or\nif any planned future products will prove safe enough to receive regulatory approval or clearance. Undesirable side effects caused by our CellFX System, NPS pulses, or any of our planned future products could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials. They could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval of planned future products by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authority.\nAdditionally, if we or others identify undesirable side effects caused by such product, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\uf0b7we may be forced to recall such product and suspend the marketing of such product;\n\uf0b7regulatory authorities may withdraw their approvals of such product;\n\uf0b7regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label and/or narrow the indication that could diminish the usage or otherwise limit the commercial success of such products;\n\uf0b7the FDA or other regulatory authorities may issue safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases, or other communications containing warnings about such product;\n\uf0b7the FDA may restrict distribution of our products and impose burdensome implementation requirements on us;\n\uf0b7we may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials;\n\uf0b7we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to subjects or patients;\n\uf0b7we may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n\uf0b7our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular planned product, if approved.\nOur business is dependent upon physicians adopting our CellFX System and NPS technology, and if we fail to obtain broad adoption, our business would be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to educate physicians regarding the benefits of CellFX procedures over existing treatment modalities and to persuade them to prescribe CellFX procedures for their patients. We do not know if the CellFX System or NPS technology will be successful over the long term, and market acceptance may be hindered if physicians are not presented with compelling data demonstrating the efficacy and safety of our products compared to alternative treatments. Any studies we, or third parties, may conduct comparing our CellFX System or NPS technology with alternative treatments may be expensive, time consuming or may not yield positive results. Additionally, adoption will be directly influenced by a number of financial factors, including the ability of providers to attract cash payments from patients or to obtain sufficient reimbursement from third-party commercial payors, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for the professional services they provide in administering CellFX procedures. The efficacy, safety, performance and cost-effectiveness of our CellFX System, NPS technology, or other potential products based on NPS technology, on a stand-alone basis and relative to competing services, will determine the availability and level of reimbursement received by us and providers. If physicians do not adopt and prescribe our future products, we may never become profitable.\nWe may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials. If we cannot enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in the clinical trials, we may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials, which could delay or prevent development of our product candidates.\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical trials depends on the speed at which we can recruit patients to participate in testing our product candidates as well as completion of required follow-up periods. In general, if patients are unwilling to participate in our trials because of negative publicity from adverse events in the health care industry or for other reasons, including competitive clinical trials for similar patient populations, the timeline for recruiting patients, conducting trials and obtaining regulatory approval or clearance of planned products may be delayed. If there are delays in accumulating the required patients and patient data, there may be delays in completing the trial. Further, if any of our clinical trial sites fail to comply with required good clinical practices, we\nmay be unable to use the data gathered at those sites. If our clinical investigators fail to carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be delayed, suspended, or terminated. These delays could result in increased costs, delays in advancing our product development, delays in testing the effectiveness of our technology or termination of the clinical trials altogether, and delays in obtaining regulatory authorization for our products. Our clinical trials may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Site initiation and patient enrollment may be delayed, for example, due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic, travel restrictions imposed by governments, and the inability to access sites for initiation and monitoring.\nLaboratory conditions differ from commercial conditions and field conditions, and the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates may depend on the technique of the user.\nObservations and developments that may be achievable under laboratory circumstances may not be able to be replicated in broader research and development phases, in commercial settings, or in the use of any of the product candidates in the field. Furthermore, CellFX procedures will be administered by healthcare professionals and will require a degree of training and practice to administer correctly. Treatment results achieved during the laboratory or in clinical trials conducted by us or other investigators may not be representative of the results actually encountered during commercial use of our products due to variability in administration technique. The training and skills of investigators in our clinical trials may not be representative of the training and skills of future product users, which could negatively affect treatment results. In addition, there may be a selection bias in the patients and/or sites of administration chosen for any clinical trials that would positively affect treatment results that may not be representative or predictive of real-world experience with our products.\nIssues with our firmware and software may negatively affect the function of our devices.\nThe safety and effectiveness of CellFX procedures and therapies may depend, in part, on the function of firmware run by the microprocessors embedded in the device and associated software. This firmware and software is proprietary to us. While we have made efforts to test the firmware and software extensively, it is potentially subject to malfunction which in turn may harm a patient. Further, it may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, hackers, improper employee or contractor access, computer viruses, programming errors, data breaches, or similar problems. Any of these might result in harm to a patient or the unauthorized release of confidential medical, business or other information of other persons or of ours.\nWe may encounter manufacturing problems or delays that could result in lost revenue. Additionally, we currently rely on third-party suppliers for critical materials needed to manufacture our CellFX System and related applicators. Any problems experienced by these suppliers could result in a delay or interruption of their supply to us, and as a result, we may face delays in the development and commercialization of planned products.\nWe perform final assembly of our devices at our facility in California. We believe we have an adequate inventory of materials and manufacturing capacity to support all our commercial launch activities. However, if demand for our product increases significantly, we will need to either expand our manufacturing capabilities or outsource to other manufacturers. We are in the process of commencing commercial-scale manufacturing of our product, and we currently rely upon third-party suppliers to manufacture and supply components for our CellFX System. The manufacture of these products in compliance with the FDA\u2019s regulations requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of medical device products often encounter difficulties in production, including difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with applicable FDA requirements, other federal and state regulatory requirements, and foreign regulations.\nWe do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with the regulatory requirements, and if our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture our product that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions, we may not be able to rely on their manufacturing facilities for the manufacture of our product. In addition, we have limited control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority finds these facilities inadequate for the manufacture of our product or if such facilities are subject to enforcement action in the future or are otherwise inadequate with respect to complying with applicable regulatory requirements, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop and market our product or to obtain regulatory approval or clearance for our product candidates.\nWe currently purchase components for our CellFX System under purchase orders and do not have long-term contracts with most of the suppliers of these materials. If suppliers were to delay or stop producing our components, or if the prices they charge us were to increase significantly, or if they elected not to sell to us, we would need to identify other suppliers. These suppliers may be adversely impacted by COVID-19 which could affect their ability to perform satisfactorily. Any failure of these suppliers to perform satisfactorily could adversely impact our business and results of operations and we may experience delays in manufacturing of our devices while finding another acceptable supplier.\nWe may not become commercially viable if our ultimate commercialized products or related treatments fail to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement by Medicare and other third-party payers.\nWe believe that the commercial viability of our device and any potential devices and products and related treatments, and therefore our commercial success as a company, may be affected by the availability of government reimbursement and medical insurance coverage and reimbursement for newly approved medical therapies, technologies, and devices. Insurance coverage and reimbursement are not assured. It typically takes a period of use in the marketplace before coverage and reimbursement are granted, if it is granted at all. In the U.S. and other jurisdictions in Europe and other regions, physicians and other healthcare providers generally rely on insurance coverage and reimbursement for their revenues, therefore this is an important factor in the overall commercialization plans of a proposed product and whether it will be accepted for use in the marketplace. Without insurance coverage and reimbursement for our planned products, we would expect to earn only diminished revenues, if any revenues are earned.\nMedicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations and other third-party payers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both the scope of coverage and the level of reimbursement of new medical technologies and products, and as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for the use of our planned products. In order to obtain satisfactory reimbursement arrangements, we may have to agree to reduce the fee or sales price than initially planned. Each plan may separately require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products and, as a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained at all. Even if Medicare and other third-party payers decide to cover treatments involving our proposed devices and products, we cannot be certain that the reimbursement levels will be adequate. Accordingly, even if our planned products are approved for commercial sale, unless government and other third-party payers provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our devices and products, some physicians may be discouraged from using them, and our sales would suffer.\nMedicare reimburses for medical technologies and products in a variety of ways, depending on where and how the item is used. However, Medicare only provides reimbursement if CMS determines that the item should be covered and that the use of the device or product is consistent with the coverage criteria. A coverage determination can be made at the local level by the Medicare administrative contractor, a private contractor that processes and pays claims on behalf of CMS for the geographic area where the services were rendered, or at the national level by CMS through a national coverage determination. There are statutory provisions intended to facilitate coverage determinations for new technologies, but it is unclear how these new provisions will be implemented, and it is not possible to indicate how they might apply to any of our proposed devices and products, as they are still in the development stages. Coverage presupposes that the technology, device, or product has been cleared or approved by the FDA and further, that the coverage will be consistent with the approved intended uses of the device or product as approved or cleared by the FDA, but coverage can be narrower. A coverage determination may be so limited that relatively few patients will qualify for a covered use of a device or product.\nObtaining a coverage determination, whether local or national, is a time-consuming, expensive and highly uncertain proposition, especially for a new technology, and inconsistent local determinations are possible. On average, Medicare coverage determinations for medical devices and products lag behind FDA approval or clearance. The Medicare statutory framework is also subject to administrative rulings, interpretations and discretion that affect the amount and timing of reimbursement made under Medicare. Medicaid coverage determinations and reimbursement levels are determined on a state-by-state basis, because Medicaid, unlike Medicare, is administered by the states under a state plan filed with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Medicaid generally reimburses at lower levels than Medicare. Moreover, Medicaid programs and private insurers are frequently influenced by Medicare coverage determinations.\nWe work with outside scientists and their institutions in developing our product and product candidates. These scientists may have other commitments or conflicts of interest, which could limit our access to their expertise, harm our ability to leverage our discovery platforms, or negatively impact our clinical trials.\nWe work with scientific advisors and collaborators at academic research institutions in connection with our product development. These scientists and collaborators are not our employees, but they serve as either independent contractors or\nresearchers under research agreements that we have with their sponsoring clinic, academic institution or research institution. Such scientists and collaborators may have other commitments that would limit their availability to us. Although our scientific advisors generally agree not to do competing work, if an actual or potential conflict of interest between their work for us and their work for another entity arises, we may lose their services. It is also possible that some of our valuable proprietary knowledge may become publicly known through these scientific advisors if they breach their confidentiality agreements with us, which would cause competitive harm to our business. To the extent these scientists and collaborators may receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services from time to time, these relationships and any related compensation may result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, or a regulatory authority to conclude that the financial relationship may have affected the interpretation of the trial, such that the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be questioned and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized, which could result in the delay or rejection of the marketing application we submit.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we or our licensors are unable to protect our/their intellectual property, then our financial condition, results of operations and the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nPatents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business, and our ability to compete effectively with other companies is dependent upon the proprietary nature of our technologies. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We seek to protect these, in part, through confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants and other parties. Our success will depend in part on the ability of our licensors and us to obtain, to maintain (including making periodic filings and payments) and to enforce patent protection for the licensed intellectual property, in particular, those patents to which we have secured rights. We, and our licensors, may not successfully prosecute or continue to prosecute the patent applications which we have licensed. Even if patents are issued in respect of these patent applications, we or our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue litigation against entities that are infringing upon these patents, or may pursue such enforcement less aggressively than we ordinarily would for our own patents. Without adequate protection for the intellectual property that we own or license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could unfavorably affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects. Even if issued, patents may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or limit the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products.\nLitigation or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement or challenges to the validity of our patents would require us to use resources to protect our technology and may prevent or delay our development, regulatory approval or commercialization of our product candidates.\nIf we are the target of claims by third parties asserting that our products or intellectual property infringe upon the rights of others, we may be forced to incur substantial expenses or divert substantial employee resources from our business. If successful, those claims could result in our having to pay substantial damages or could prevent us from developing one or more product candidates. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us or our collaborators, we or they could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit.\nIf we, or our collaborators, experience patent infringement claims, or if we elect to avoid potential claims others may be able to assert, we or our collaborators may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from the third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we or our collaborators were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we or our collaborators are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. This could harm our business significantly. The cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding, regardless of its merit, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to bear the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their having greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Intellectual property litigation and other proceedings may, regardless of their merit, also absorb significant management time and employee resources.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license development or commercialization rights to products or technology from third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe hold licenses from Old Dominion University Research Foundation (ODURF) and Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS) and from Alfred E. Mann Institute for Biomedical Engineering at the University of Southern California to intellectual property relating to the sub-microsecond electric field technology, as well as applicator design and configuration, and pulse generators in addition to the intellectual property that we own for these things. For the continuance of the license with ODURF and EVMS, we must continue to comply with the various obligations set forth in the license. If we fail to meet these obligations, the licensor will have the right to terminate the applicable license or modify certain terms of the license agreement. Generally, the loss of any one of our current licenses, or any other license we may acquire in the future, could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operation. In addition, some of our licenses from third parties limit the field in which we can use the licensed technology. Therefore, in order for us to use such licensed technology in potential future applications that are outside the licensed field of use, we may be required to negotiate new licenses with our licensors or expand our rights under our existing licenses. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such licenses or expanded rights on reasonable terms or at all. In the event a dispute with our licensors were to occur, our licensors may seek to renegotiate the terms of our licenses, increase the royalty rates that we pay to obtain and maintain those licenses, limit the field or scope of the licenses, or terminate the license agreements. In addition, we have limited rights to participate in the prosecution and enforcement of the patents and patent applications that we have licensed. As a result, we cannot be certain that these patents and applications will be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. Further, because of the rapid pace of technological change in our industry, we may need to rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms. The occurrence of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur intellectual property rights will not necessarily provide us with competitive advantages.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\uf0b7others may be able to make products that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\uf0b7others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies without infringing on our intellectual property rights;\n\uf0b7issued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\uf0b7we may obtain patents for certain products many years before we obtain marketing approval for products utilizing such patents, and because patents have a limited life, which may begin to run prior to the commercial sale of the related product, the commercial value of our patents may be limited;\n\uf0b7our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\uf0b7we may fail to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\uf0b7the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., or we may fail to apply for or obtain adequate intellectual property protection in all the jurisdictions in which we operate; and\n\uf0b7the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business, for example by preventing us from marketing one or more of our product candidates for one or more indications.\nAny of the aforementioned threats to our competitive advantage could harm our business.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely upon, among other things, unpatented proprietary technology, processes, trade secrets and know-how. Any involuntary disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our confidential or proprietary information could enable competitors to duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, potentially eroding our competitive position in our market. We seek to protect confidential or proprietary information in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties. While we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information and technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot be certain that this know-how, information and technology will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. These agreements may be terminated or breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such termination or breach. Furthermore, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and know-how in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure. To the extent that any of our staff were previously employed by other pharmaceutical, medical technology or biotechnology companies, those employers may allege violations of trade secrets and other similar claims in relation to their medical device development activities for us.\nIf we are unable to protect the intellectual property used in our products, others may be able to copy our innovations which may impair our ability to compete effectively in our markets.\nThe strength of our patents involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. Our patents or patent applications may be challenged or our patent applications may fail to result in issued patents and our existing or future patents may be too narrow to prevent third-parties from developing or designing around our intellectual property and in that event we may lose competitive advantage and our business may suffer. Further, the patent applications that we license or have filed may fail to result in issued patents. The claims may need to be amended. Even after amendment, a patent may not issue and in that event we may not obtain the use of the intellectual property that we seek and may lose competitive advantage which could result in harm to our business.\nWe may become involved in future lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we or our licensors may file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours, or of our licensors, is not valid or is unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. If we or any current licensors or future licensees or licensors with rights to prosecute, assert or defend patents related to our product candidates fail to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for patents covering any of our product candidates, or if patents covering any of our product candidates are asserted against infringers or defended against claims of invalidity or unenforceability in a manner which adversely affects such coverage, our ability to develop and commercialize any such product candidate may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) may initiate interference proceedings to determine the priority of inventions described in or otherwise affecting our patents and patent applications or those of our collaborators or licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if a prevailing party does not offer us a license on terms that are acceptable to us. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distraction of our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the U.S.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and third parties may not prevent unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information, which would harm our competitive position.\nIn addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information concerning our business strategy and product candidates in order to protect our competitive position, which are difficult to protect. As we collaborate with various third parties on the research and development of our planned products, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. In the course of our research and development activities and our business activities, we rely on confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary information. Such confidentiality agreements are used, for example, when we talk to vendors or potential strategic collaborators. In addition, each of our employees and consultants is required to sign a confidentiality agreement and invention assignment agreement upon joining our company. Our employees, consultants, contractors, business partners, or outside scientific collaborators might intentionally or inadvertently disclose our trade secret information in breach of these confidentiality agreements, or our trade secrets may otherwise be misappropriated. Our collaborators might also have rights to publish data, and we might fail to apply for patent protection prior to such publication. It is possible that a competitor will make use of such information, and that our competitive position will be compromised. In addition, to the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the U.S. sometimes are less willing than U.S. courts to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, and our trade secrets cannot be enforced against such independently developed knowledge. If we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary technology and other confidential information, then our ability to obtain patent protection or to protect our trade secret information would be jeopardized, which would adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties or that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAlthough we seek to protect our ownership of intellectual property rights by ensuring that our agreements with our independent contractors, collaborators and other third parties with whom we do business include provisions requiring such parties to assign rights in inventions to us, we may also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. We may be subject to ownership disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the U.S. can be less extensive than those in the U.S. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the U.S. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the U.S., or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the U.S. or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the U.S. These products may compete with our current or future product candidates, if any, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. We believe this is caused by both the technical nature of the subject matter and a general enthusiasm for generic competition in developing countries and is not a concern that is specific to any particular foreign jurisdiction. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nWe have not yet registered some of our trademarks in all of our potential markets, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business. If our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared generic or conflict with third-party rights. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition by potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. Additionally, if we apply to register our trademarks in all of our potential markets, our applications may not be allowed for registration, and our registered trademarks may not be maintained or enforced. In addition, in the USPTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. If we do not secure registrations for our trademarks, we may encounter more difficulty in enforcing them against third parties than we otherwise would. In such cases, over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then our marketing abilities may be impacted.\nChanges in patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our existing and future products.\nPatent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. In 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (Leahy-Smith Act) was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and also may affect patent litigation. These also include provisions that switched the U.S. from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system, allow third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and set forth additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by the USPTO administered post grant proceedings. Under a first-to-file system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention earlier. The USPTO developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective in 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. The Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, patent reform legislation may pass in the future that could lead to additional uncertainties and increased costs surrounding the prosecution, enforcement and defense of our patents and applications. Furthermore, the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws of the U.S. are interpreted. Similarly, foreign courts have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws in their respective jurisdictions are interpreted. We cannot predict future changes in the interpretation of patent laws or changes to patent laws that might be enacted into law by U.S. and foreign legislative bodies. Those changes may materially affect our patents or patent applications and our ability to obtain additional patent protection in the future.\n\u200e\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nWe will be subject to stringent domestic and foreign regulation in respect of our device any potential devices and products. Any unfavorable regulatory action may materially and adversely affect our future financial condition and business operations and prospects.\nOur device and any potential devices and products, further development activities and manufacturing and distribution, once developed and determined, will be subject to extensive, rigorous, and ongoing regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities. To varying degrees, each of these agencies monitors and enforces our compliance with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution, and the safety and effectiveness of our medical technology. The process of obtaining and maintaining marketing approval or clearance from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities for new devices and products, or for enhancements, expansion of the indications or modifications to existing products, could:\n\uf0b7take a significant, indeterminate amount of time;\n\uf0b7require the expenditure of substantial resources;\n\uf0b7involve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing, and possibly post-market surveillance;\n\uf0b7involve modifications, repairs or replacements of our products;\n\uf0b7require design changes of our products;\n\uf0b7result in limitations on the indicated uses of our products; and\n\uf0b7result in our never being granted the regulatory approval or clearance we seek.\nIf we experience any of these occurrences, our operations may suffer, we might experience harm to our competitive standing and result in further losses that adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe will have ongoing responsibilities under FDA and international regulations, both before and after a product is approved or cleared and commercially released. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections. If an inspection were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities could ban such devices or products, detain or seize such devices or products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such devices or products, or require us to notify health professionals and others that the therapies, devices or products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. Additionally, the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities may impose other operating restrictions, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to our devices and products and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees, or us. The FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities have been increasing its scrutiny of the industry and the government is expected to continue to scrutinize the industry closely with inspections and possibly enforcement actions. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively manufacturing, marketing and selling our devices and products. In addition, negative publicity and product liability claims resulting from any adverse regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe continuing development of our CellFX System and other products depends upon maintaining strong working relationships with physicians.\nThe development, marketing, and sale of our product, and any future products in development, depends upon our ability to maintain strong working relationships with physicians. We rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development, marketing, and sale of our products. Physicians assist us in clinical trials and as researchers, marketing and product consultants and public speakers. If we cannot maintain our strong working relationships with these professionals and continue to receive their advice and input, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The medical device industry\u2019s relationship with physicians is under increasing scrutiny by the Office of Inspector General (OIG), the Department of Justice (DOJ), state attorneys general, and other foreign and domestic government agencies. Our failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations governing our relationships with physicians, or an investigation into our compliance by the OIG, DOJ,\nstate attorneys general and other government agencies, could significantly harm our business, including compromising the use or integrity of our clinical data in regulatory submissions to the FDA or similar regulatory authorities.\nWe are subject to healthcare and other laws and regulations relating to our business and could face substantial penalties if we are determined not to have fully complied with such laws, which would have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees and independent contractors, including principal investigators, consultants, any future commercial collaborators, service providers and other vendors may engage in misconduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or other unauthorized activities that violate the laws and regulations of the FDA and other similar regulatory bodies. There are many federal and state laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry that can result in significant criminal and civil penalties. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we research, market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval or clearance. Such laws include:\n\uf0b7U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The term \u201cremuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, and the government can find a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute without proving that a person or entity had actual knowledge of the law or a specific intent to violate. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act;\n\uf0b7U.S. federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which, among other things, impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the U.S. government, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. government;\n\uf0b7HIPAA imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\uf0b7HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization by covered entities subject to the rule, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers as well as their business associates that perform certain services for or on their behalf involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information;\n\uf0b7the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the government information related to payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to the government ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members;\n\uf0b7the CCPA, which went into effect in January 2020, requires covered companies to, among other things provide new disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. We cannot yet predict the impact of the CCPA or the recently approved CPRA on our business or operations, but it may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply;\n\uf0b7federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and\n\uf0b7analogous state and non-U.S. laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information; and state and non-U.S. laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nWe have implemented a compliance program to help identify and deter healthcare and other violations by employees and other third parties that perform services for us. Notwithstanding our efforts, it is possible that governmental authorities may conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable healthcare and other laws. In addition, we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege violations of such laws, regulations and other obligations, or that fraud or other misconduct has taken place, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and financial results, including, without limitation, the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgements, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other U.S. healthcare programs, individual imprisonment, other sanctions, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of our operations if we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. If any of the above occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nTo obtain the necessary device approvals or clearances from regulatory authorities for our future product candidates, we will have to conduct various pre-clinical and clinical tests, which may be costly and time consuming, and may not provide results that will allow us to seek regulatory approval or clearance.\nThe number of pre-clinical and clinical tests that will be required for regulatory clearance or approval varies depending on the disease or condition to be treated, the method of treatment, the nature of the device, the jurisdiction in which we are seeking approval or clearance and the applicable regulations. Regulatory agencies, including those in the U.S., Canada, Europe and other countries where medical devices and products are regulated, can delay, limit or deny approval of a product for many reasons. For example, regulatory agencies:\n\uf0b7may not deem a technology or device to be reasonably safe or effective for any intended use or indication;\n\uf0b7may interpret data from pre-clinical and clinical testing differently than we do;\n\uf0b7may determine our manufacturing facility or processes do not comply with Quality System regulations;\n\uf0b7may conclude that our device does not meet quality standards for durability, long-term reliability, biocompatibility, electromagnetic compatibility, or electrical safety; and\n\uf0b7may change their approval or clearance policies or adopt new regulations.\nThe FDA may make requests or disagree with us regarding the design or conduct of our clinical trials, resulting in an increased risk of difficulties or delays in obtaining regulatory approval or clearance on future product candidates in the U.S. and increased costs.\nEven if a potential device or product ultimately is cleared or approved by the different regulatory authorities, it may be cleared or approved only for narrow indications which may render it commercially less viable.\nEven if we complete clinical testing and a potential device or product of ours is cleared or approved, it may not be cleared or approved for the indications that are necessary or desirable for a successful commercialization. The FDA may grant marketing authorization contingent on the performance of costly additional clinical trials which may be required after approval\nor clearance. The FDA also may approve or clear our lead product candidates for a more limited indication or a narrower patient population than we originally requested. Our preference will be to obtain as broad an indication as possible for use in connection with the particular disease or treatment for which it is designed. However, the final indication or labeling may be more limited than we originally seek. The limitation on use may make the device or product commercially less viable and more difficult, if not impractical, to market. Therefore, we may not obtain the revenues that we seek in respect of the proposed product, and we will not be able to become profitable and provide an investment return to our investors.\nWe will be subject to ongoing requirements and inspections that could lead to the restriction, suspension or revocation of our clearance.\nWe, as well as any potential third-party manufacturer, will be required to adhere to FDA Quality System, which include testing, control, and documentation requirements. We will be subject to similar regulations in foreign countries. Even when regulatory approval or clearance of a product is granted, the approval or clearance may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval or clearance, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. Ongoing compliance with Quality System regulations and other applicable regulatory requirements is strictly enforced in the U.S. through periodic inspections by state and federal agencies, including the FDA, and in international jurisdictions by comparable agencies. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure to obtain premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices, withdrawal of approvals or clearances previously obtained, and criminal prosecution. The restriction, suspension or revocation of regulatory approvals or clearances, or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements will limit our ability to operate and could increase our costs.\nAny failure or delay in completing clinical trials or studies for our devices and products and the expense of those trials may adversely affect our business.\nPre-clinical studies, clinical trials and post-clinical monitoring and trials required to demonstrate the reasonable safety and efficacy of our potential devices and products are and will be time consuming and expensive. If we must conduct additional clinical trials or other studies with respect to any of our proposed product candidates to those that are initially contemplated, if we are unable to successfully complete any clinical trials or other studies, or if the results of these trials or studies are not positive or are only modestly positive, we may be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for the planned products, we may not be able to obtain marketing approval, or we may obtain approval for indications that are not as broad as we seek. Our research and product development costs also will increase if we experience delays in testing or approvals. The completion of clinical trials for our proposed therapies, devices and products could be delayed because of our inability to manufacture or obtain from third-parties materials sufficient for use in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials; delays in patient enrollment and variability in the number and types of patients available for clinical trials; difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment, resulting in incomplete data; poor effectiveness of proposed devices and products during clinical trials; unforeseen safety issues or side effects; and governmental or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory requirements and guidelines. If we incur significant delays in our clinical trials, our competitors may be able to bring their products to market before we do, which could result in harming our ability to commercialize our planned products. If we experience any of these occurrences our business will be materially harmed. Our clinical trials may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Site initiation and patient enrollment may be delayed, for example, due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic, travel restrictions imposed by governments, and the inability to access sites for initiation and monitoring.\nBecause we and one of our licensors have used federal funding in the development of certain aspects of our technology, the federal government retains \u2018march-in\u2019 rights in connection with results derived from these grants.\nMarch-in rights give the federal government the right to grant to other entities, which may include competitors, licenses or to take a license for itself if the government funded the development of a patent. The march-in right applies to patents that have been issued. The march-in right is intended to be used only if there is a threat to public health and safety that the owner of the patent is not equipped to handle. The march-in right may also be used to remove the exclusive rights belonging to a patent holder if the patent for which the government provided funding is not suitable for public use. If march-in rights are used by the government, the entities using the patent are required to pay royalties to the patent holder, which amount would be subject to negotiation. Because federal funding was used for some aspects of the company\u2019s technology that will be the subject of some of our patents, the company could be subject to the march-in right and lose its exclusivity of those patents, and may suffer direct competition if any license is granted by the government under the march-in right to a competitor.\nOur employees, collaborators and other personnel may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by or employees, collaborators and other personnel, which could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates: (i) the laws of the FDA and other similar foreign regulatory bodies, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such regulators; (ii) manufacturing standards; or (iii) healthcare fraud and abuse laws in the U.S. and similar foreign fraudulent misconduct laws. These laws may impact, among other things, future sales, marketing and education programs. The promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare items and services, as well as certain business arrangements in the healthcare industry, are subject to extensive laws designed to prevent fraud and abuse, kickbacks, self-dealing, and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, structuring and commissions, certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of patient recruitment for clinical trials.\nWe adopted a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. Whether or not we are successful in defending against any such actions or investigations, we could incur substantial costs, including legal fees, and divert the attention of management in defending ourselves against any of these claims or investigations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nHealthcare policy changes, including recent federal legislation to reform the U.S. healthcare system, may have a material adverse effect on us.\nProposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators, and third-party payors to control or manage the increased costs of healthcare and to reform the U.S. healthcare system may impact our business significantly. Certain proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the coverage and reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products. The adoption of proposals to control costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future or their full impact on our business. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may negatively impact our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products, our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability, and the availability of capital.\nOur operations may be impacted by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). For example, the PPACA imposed, among other things, a 2.3% federal excise tax, with limited exceptions, on any entity that manufactures or imports Class I, II and III medical devices offered for sale in the U.S. that began on January 1, 2013. The excise tax was suspended for a two year period beginning January 1, 2016 and was further suspended through December 31, 2019. In December 2019, this excise tax was permanently repealed, effective after December 31, 2019.\nOn January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, came into effect, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare devices and services, which could result in reduced demand for our devices or additional pricing pressures.\nWe face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the PPACA, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions. The impact of those changes on us and potential effect on the medical device industry as a whole is currently unknown. Any changes to the PPACA are likely to have an impact on our results of operations, and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the U.S. may have on our business.\n\u200e\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock has been, and we expect it to continue to be, highly volatile, and you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid to acquire them.\nThe market price of our common stock has been highly volatile, and we expect it to continue to be highly volatile for the foreseeable future in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including:\n\uf0b7results of clinical trials of our planned products or those of our competitors;\n\uf0b7actions by regulatory bodies, such as the FDA, that affect our business or have the effect of delaying or rejecting approval or clearance of our planned products;\n\uf0b7actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\uf0b7announcements by our customers, partners or suppliers relating directly or indirectly to our products, services or technologies;\n\uf0b7announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\uf0b7changes in laws or regulations applicable to our planned products;\n\uf0b7announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments or achievement of significant milestones;\n\uf0b7additions or departures of key personnel;\n\uf0b7competition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\uf0b7fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\uf0b7disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters or our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our technologies;\n\uf0b7actual or alleged security breaches;\n\uf0b7announcements or expectations of additional financing efforts;\n\uf0b7sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\uf0b7stock price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\uf0b7reports, guidance and ratings issued by securities or industry analysts;\n\uf0b7overall conditions in our industry and market including the negative impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and markets; and\n\uf0b7general economic and market conditions.\nIf any of the foregoing occurs, it may cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Stock markets in general, and the market for companies in our industry in particular, have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. Investors may not realize any return on their investment in us and may lose some or all of their investment. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns and adversely impact our ability to raise capital to fund our operations, which could seriously harm our business.\nSales or purchases of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market for our common stock.\nIf we or our stockholders, particularly our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, sell or purchase, register for sale, or indicate an intent to sell or purchase, shares of our common stock in the public market, it may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In particular, Robert W. Duggan is not subject to any contractual restrictions with us on his ability to sell or transfer our common stock, and these sales or transfers could create substantial declines in the price of our securities or, if these sales or transfers were made to a single buyer or group of buyers, could contribute to a transfer of control of our company to a third party. Sales by Mr. Duggan of a substantial number of shares, or the expectation of such sales, could cause a significant reduction in the market price of our common stock.\nWe may issue shares of common stock or securities convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock from time to time in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments or otherwise. Any such issuances would result in dilution to some or all of our existing stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall. We may also sell shares or other securities at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by existing investors, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders.\nWe do not know whether an active, liquid and orderly trading market will be maintained for our common stock and as a result it may be difficult for you to sell your common stock.\nPrior to our initial public offering in May 2016, there was no public market for our common stock. Although our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market (Nasdaq), the market for our shares has demonstrated varying levels of trading activity. As a result of these and other factors, you may not be able to sell your common stock quickly or at or above the price paid to acquire the stock or at all. Further, an inactive market may also harm our ability to raise capital by selling additional common stock and may harm our ability to enter into strategic collaborations or acquire companies or products by using our common stock as consideration.\nConcentration of ownership by our principal stockholder may limit your ability to influence the outcome of director elections and other transactions requiring stockholder approval, and our Loan Agreement with our principal stockholder contains certain covenants.\nA significant percentage of our outstanding stock is held by Robert W. Duggan, Chairman of our board of directors, who beneficially owns approximately 47% of our common stock outstanding as of the date of this Annual Report. As a result, Mr. Duggan has significant influence over corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the following actions:\n\uf0b7to elect or defeat the election of our directors;\n\uf0b7to amend or prevent amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws;\n\uf0b7to effect or prevent a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction; and\n\uf0b7to control the outcome of any other matter submitted to our stockholders for vote.\nMr. Duggan\u2019s stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price. In addition, Mr. Duggan is not subject to any contractual restrictions on his ability to acquire additional shares of common stock and any such purchases, including purchases of equity securities in connection with any rights offerings or any alternative equity or equity-linked offering that we may conduct, could result in his acquisition of a\nmajority of our common stock. If this were to occur, we would be considered a \u201ccontrolled\u201d company under the Nasdaq rules and would be exempt from the obligation to comply with certain Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.\nManagement currently beneficially holds a small percentage of our common stock. Other than their positions as directors or officers, and the restriction on the stockholders being able to call a special meeting limited to holders of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock, our management will not be able to greatly influence corporate actions requiring stockholder approval.\nMr. Duggan is the lender to us under our Loan Agreement, which contains certain covenants.\nRobert W. Duggan\u2019s significant ownership position may impact our stock price and may deter or prevent efforts by other companies to acquire us, which could prevent our stockholders from realizing a control premium.\nRobert W. Duggan is the Chairman of our board of directors, and beneficially owns approximately 47% of our common stock outstanding as of the date of this Annual Report. In addition, Mr. Duggan is not subject to any contractual restrictions on his ability to acquire additional shares of common stock, and any such purchases, including purchases of equity securities in connection with any rights offerings or any alternative equity or equity-linked offering that we may conduct, could result in his acquisition of a majority of our common stock. As a result of Robert W. Duggan\u2019s significant ownership and position as Chairman of the board of directors, other companies may be less inclined to pursue an acquisition of us and therefore we may not have the opportunity to be acquired in a transaction that stockholders might otherwise deem favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might realize a substantial premium for their shares. In addition, public speculation regarding Mr. Duggan, as well as our relationship with Mr. Duggan, could cause our stock price to fluctuate.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management has been and will be required to devote substantial time to public company compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, listed in the U.S., we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses due to our compliance with regulations and disclosure obligations applicable to us, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq. The SEC and other regulators have continued to adopt new rules and regulations and make additional changes to existing regulations that require our compliance.\nStockholder activism, the current political environment, and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact, in ways we cannot currently anticipate, the manner in which we operate our business. Our management and other personnel have and will continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance programs and monitoring of public company reporting obligations and, as a result of the new corporate governance and executive compensation related rules, regulations, and guidelines prompted by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, and further regulations and disclosure obligations expected in the future, we will likely need to devote additional time and costs to comply with such compliance programs and rules. New laws and regulations as well as changes to existing laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, and rules adopted by the SEC and Nasdaq, will likely result in increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements. We are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these rules and regulations, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.\nFurthermore, these and future rules and regulations could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. For example, we determined not to renew our director and officer liability insurance this year due to disproportionately high premiums quoted by insurance companies. Instead, we and Robert W. Duggan, Chairman of our board of directors, have entered into a letter agreement pursuant to which Mr. Duggan has agreed with us to personally provide indemnity coverage on substantially the same terms as our prior coverage program for a one-year period. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as our executive officers.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our market price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. We currently have only limited analyst\ncoverage of us and there can be no assurance that analysts will continue to cover us or provide favorable coverage. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock, our market price would likely decline. If analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and have no plans to pay dividends.\nWe plan to reinvest all of our earnings, to the extent we have earnings, into our product research and development. We do not plan to pay any cash dividends with respect to our securities in the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you that we would, at any time, generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend. Therefore, you should not expect to receive cash dividends on our outstanding common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nCertain anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that:\n\uf0b7authorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock and up to approximately 500,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued shares of common stock;\n\uf0b7require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\uf0b7specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors, any of our officers, or any stockholder holding at least fifteen percent (15%) of the voting power of the capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote;\n\uf0b7establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\uf0b7the requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of our voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend provisions of our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws;\n\uf0b7the ability of our board of directors by majority vote, to amend the bylaws; and\n\uf0b7provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. Furthermore, our bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of us to us or our stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (d) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to the Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein; provided that, if and only if the Court of Chancery dismisses any such action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, such action may be brought in another state or federal court sitting in Delaware. Our bylaws further provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive-forum provisions may discourage lawsuits against us or our directors, officers, and employees. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section\n203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to engage in certain types of transactions with us.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nUnfavorable global economic or political conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets including the negative impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and markets. Furthermore, the market for aesthetic medical treatments may be particularly vulnerable to unfavorable economic conditions. A global financial crisis or a global or regional political disruption could cause extreme volatility in the capital and credit markets as has recently been the case due to COVID-19. A severe or prolonged economic downturn or political disruption could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for our lead product candidates or any future product candidates, if approved, and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy or political disruption could also strain our manufacturers or suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our customers to delay making payments for our services. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the political or economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nIf we experience material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report on internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. The identification of one or more material weaknesses would preclude a conclusion that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, there could continue to be a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe are required to disclose changes made in our internal control and procedures on a quarterly basis. However, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act) if we continue to take advantage of the exemptions contained in the JOBS Act. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating. Our remediation efforts may not enable us to avoid a material weakness in the future. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or when required in the future, if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an unqualified opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nWe may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us.\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings relating to securities laws, product liability, patent infringement, contract disputes and other matters relating to various claims that arise in the normal course of our business in addition to governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. In addition, third parties may, from time to time, assert claims against us in the form of letters and other communications. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, cause us to incur significant expenses or liability and/or require us to change our business practices. Because of the potential risks, expenses and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we have meritorious claims or defenses, by agreeing to settlement agreements. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. See the section entitled \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for more detail on our current legal proceedings.\nOur business may be adversely affected by health epidemics including the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders, and business shutdowns.\nIn accordance with local and state guidelines regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, we are requiring all of our employees to work remotely unless they cannot perform their essential functions remotely and have also suspended all non-essential travel for our employees. While many of our employees are accustomed to working remotely or working with other remote employees, much of our workforce has not historically been remote. Although we continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies as more information and public health guidance becomes available, temporarily suspending travel and restricting the ability to do business in person may create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our clinical trials may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Site initiation and patient enrollment may be delayed, for example, due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic, travel restrictions imposed by governments, and the inability to access sites for initiation and monitoring. Also, some of our suppliers of certain materials used in the production of our product candidates are located in areas impacted by COVID-19 which could limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials for our product candidates. COVID-19 has and will continue to adversely affect global economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our product candidates, if approved, and impact our operating results. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience an adverse impact to our business as a result of the continued global economic impact of the pandemic. We could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which health epidemics such as COVID-19 could adversely impact our business. Although we are continuing to monitor and assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change.\nOur facilities in California are located near known earthquake faults, and the occurrence of an earthquake or other catastrophic disaster could cause damage to our facilities and equipment, which could require us to cease or curtail operations.\nOur facilities in Hayward, California are located near known earthquake fault zones and are vulnerable to damage from earthquakes. We are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including fire, floods, power loss, communications failures and similar events. If any disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business at our facilities would be seriously, or potentially completely, impaired. In addition, the nature of our activities could cause significant delays in our research programs and commercial activities and make it difficult for us to recover from a disaster. The insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions. Accordingly, an earthquake or other disaster could materially and adversely harm our ability to conduct business.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act as well as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d; as a result, we cannot be certain if the applicable reduced disclosure requirements will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We also qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act, and so long as we remain a smaller reporting company, we benefit from and may take advantage of scaled disclosure requirements.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. Investors may be unable to compare our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our reporting is not as transparent as other companies in our industry. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the end of 2021.", "PERMNO": 16066, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "PLSE"}
