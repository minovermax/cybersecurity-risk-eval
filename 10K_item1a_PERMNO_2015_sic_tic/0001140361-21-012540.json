{"cik": "944480", "company": "GSE SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-04-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS.\nThe following are some of the factors that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report and other public statements we have made. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently see as immaterial, may also harm our business. Most of these risks are generally beyond our control. If any of the risks or uncertainties described below, or any such other or additional risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. The following information should be read in conjunction with Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes under Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nA novel strain of coronavirus, the COVID-19 virus, may adversely affect our business operations and financial condition.\nIn December 2019, an outbreak of the COVID-19 virus was reported in Wuhan, China. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 virus a global pandemic and on March 13, 2020, President Donald J. Trump declared the virus a national emergency in the United States. This highly contagious disease has spread to most of the countries in the world and throughout the United States, creating a serious impact on customers, workforces and suppliers, disrupting economies and financial markets, and potentially leading to a world-wide economic downturn. It has caused a disruption of the normal operations of many businesses, including the temporary closure or scale-back of business operations and/or the imposition of either quarantine or remote work or meeting requirements for employees, either by government order or on a voluntary basis. The pandemic may adversely affect our customers\u2019 operations, our employees and our employee productivity. It may also impact the ability of our subcontractors, partners, and suppliers to operate and fulfill their contractual obligations, and result in an increase in costs, delays or disruptions in performance. These supply chain effects, and the direct effect of the virus and the disruption on our employees and operations, may negatively impact both our ability to meet customer demand and our revenue and profit margins. Our employees, in many cases, are working remotely and using various technologies to perform their functions. We might experience delays or changes in customer demand, particularly if customer funding priorities change. Further, in reaction to the spread of COVID-19 in the United States, many businesses have instituted social distancing policies, including the closure of offices and worksites and deferring planned business activity. Our Performance Solutions business segment, as they are classified essential, for the most part continue without pause. With regard to our Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting business segment, because of the embedded presence of our on-site workforce, if COVID-19 or a similar outbreak of infectious disease were to prevent our workers from being deployed to the applicable customer site, it may disrupt our Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting service offerings, interrupt performance on our Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting contracts with clients and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the disruption and volatility in the global and domestic capital markets may increase the cost of capital and limit our ability to access capital. Both the health and economic aspects of the COVID-19 virus are highly fluid and the future course of each is uncertain. For these reasons and other reasons that may come to light if the coronavirus pandemic and associated protective or preventative measures expand, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business operations, revenues and financial condition; however, its ultimate impact is highly uncertain and subject to change.\nIf we cannot comply with the financial or other restrictive covenants in our credit agreement, or obtain waivers or other relief from our lender, we may cause an event of default to occur, which could result in loss of our sources of liquidity and acceleration of our debt.\nIn order to fund acquisition related costs we entered into a debt agreement for which a line of credit remains outstanding. We may not be able to refinance or restructure any of our debt, sell assets or raise equity, in each case on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy repayment obligations or to refinance or restructure these obligations on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our credit agreement also contains financial and other restrictive covenants. Our ability to comply with the covenants in our credit agreement will depend upon our future performance and various other factors, some of which are beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain compliance with all of these covenants. In that event, we would need to seek an amendment to our credit agreement, a waiver from our lender, utilize cash to pay down outstanding debt and/or refinance or restructure our debt. There can be no assurance that we could obtain future amendments or waivers of our credit agreement, or refinance or restructure our debt, in each case on commercially reasonably terms or at all. Our failure to maintain compliance with the covenants under our credit agreement could result in an event of default, subject to applicable notice and cure provisions. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit agreement, our lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable, terminate all commitments to extend further credit and cease making further loans. If we were unable to repay all outstanding amounts in full, our lender could exercise various remedies including instituting foreclosure proceedings against our assets pledged to them as collateral to secure that debt.\nIf we do not receive full or partial forgiveness of the PPP loan from the United States Small Business Administration (SBA), we will be required to remit the amount not forgiven by the SBA to our lender in accordance with the terms of the PPP loan starting on the date established by the SBA, which could result in loss of sources of liquidity and acceleration of debt.\nWe received a payroll protection program loan (PPP Loan) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) in the amount of ten million dollars ($10,000,000). Pursuant to the regulations promulgated by the SBA, we were required to submit an application to our lender requesting forgiveness for the PPP Loan and substantiating that we were entitled to the PPP Loan and used the proceeds of the PPP Loan as permitted under the CARES Act. Our application for forgiveness has been submitted to the SBA. The SBA has 90 days from submission of the forgiveness application to review the request and communicate its determination to our lender. If the SBA determines that we were ineligible for the PPP Loan, we will be required to immediately repay the PPP Loan to our lender. If the SBA determines that we did not spend the proceeds of the PPP Loan as required by the CARES Act in order to obtain forgiveness of the PPP Loan (in whole or in part), we will be required to repay the PPP Loan over two (2) years. The failure to obtain forgiveness from the SBA with respect to our PPP Loan (in whole or in part) could result in the loss of liquidity and acceleration of debt, which ultimately could result in our being unable to meet our debts as they become due. Our lender has reviewed our application for forgiveness and associated documentation, forwarding it to the SBA with their determination that the loan is fully forgivable on February 26, 2021. However, we are ultimately subject to the SBA\u2019s process and conclusion for forgiveness. To the extent the loan amount is not forgiven under the PPP, we are obligated to make equal monthly payments of principal and interest, beginning after determination of forgiveness by the SBA.\nOur business is largely dependent on sales to the nuclear power industry. Any significant disruption in this industry would have a material adverse effect upon our revenue and profitability.\nIn 2020 and 2019, 89.0% and 90% of our revenue, respectively, was from customers in the nuclear power industry customers. We expect to derive a significant portion of our revenue from customers in the nuclear power industry for the foreseeable future. Market demand for, and our ability to supply nuclear power plant simulators and related products and services is dependent on the continued operation of nuclear power plants globally and, to a lesser extent, on the construction of new nuclear power plants. A wide range of factors affect the continued operation and construction of nuclear power plants, including the political, regulatory and legal environment in which they operate, the availability and cost of alternative means of power generation, the occurrence of future nuclear incidents, such as the one which occurred at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in 2011, and general economic conditions. Significant regulatory changes in the U.S. or abroad could materially affect demand for our products, the profitability of our service deliveries to nuclear power industry customers, and the overall efficacy of our current business model.\nOur sales to foreign customers expose us to risks associated with operating internationally.\nSales of products and services to end users outside the United States accounted for approximately 17.0% of the Company\u2019s consolidated revenue in 2020 and 16.0% of consolidated revenue in 2019. Consequently, our businesses are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:\n\u2022\nexport laws and regulations that could erode our profit margins or restrict the export of some or all of our products;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar non-U.S. regulations such as the UK Bribery Act;\n\u2022\nthe burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties and technical standards generally, as well as responding to changes in those requirements;\n\u2022\ncontract award and funding delays;\n\u2022\npotential restrictions on transfers of funds;\n\u2022\npotential difficulties in accounts receivable collection;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations, including costs and potentially limited availability of viable hedging options;\n\u2022\nimport and export duties and value added or other taxes;\n\u2022\ntransportation and communication delays and interruptions;\n\u2022\ndifferences in insurance availability and coverage in some jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ndifficulties involving strategic alliances and managing foreign sales agents or representatives;\n\u2022\nuncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations; and\n\u2022\npotential military conflicts and political risks.\n\u2022\npotential disruption of our international business due to the worldwide COVID-19 virus outbreak.\nIn December 2019, an outbreak of the COVID-19 virus was reported in Wuhan, China. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 virus a global pandemic. This highly contagious disease has spread to most of the countries in the world and throughout the United States, creating a serious impact on customers, workforces and suppliers, disrupting economies and financial markets, and potentially leading to a world-wide economic downturn. It has caused a disruption of the normal operations of many businesses, including the temporary closure or scale-back of business operations and/or the imposition of either quarantine or remote work or meeting requirements for employees, either by government order or on a voluntary basis. The pandemic may adversely affect our international customers\u2019 operations, our employees and our employee productivity. It may also impact the ability of our subcontractors, partners, and suppliers to operate and fulfill their contractual obligations, and result in an increase in costs, delays or disruptions in performance. These supply chain effects, and the direct effect of the virus and the disruption on our employees and operations, may negatively impact both our ability to meet customer demand and our revenue and profit margins.\nWhile we have and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of our foreign business, we cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not have revenues greater than 10% from any individual foreign country.\nExports and sales to certain foreign countries, including the People\u2019s Republic of China, are subject to regulatory, political, and other risks.\nThe export and sale of our services and technology to certain foreign countries including China, are subject to U.S. export control regulations. Export control policy pertaining to China and other countries may be enforced through laws and regulations administered by the Department of Commerce and the Department of Energy, and jurisdiction with regard to the export and sale of our services and technology may be overlapping and unclear. Specific governmental authorizations may be required before we can export our services or technology to countries such as China, or collaborate with foreign entities or foreign individuals located in countries such as China. These restrictions include our own wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary and its employees. If export or other authorizations are required and not granted, or are significantly delayed, our international business plans pertaining to China and other countries could be materially affected. Further, our exports and sales to China and other countries with respect to which the United States may have shifting or negative diplomatic and trade relations, including sales made by or through our wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary, expose us to particular risks associated with the political and regulatory relationship between the U.S. and China and between the U.S. and such other countries.\nIn October 2018, the Department of Energy announced the tightening of certain export control restrictions with regard to the export of nuclear technology to China, including certain presumptive denials with regard to the export of identified nuclear technologies to China. Although we do not believe that these policy changes cover our technologies or services, additional restrictions pertaining to U.S. regulation and policy pertaining to international trade with China could adversely affect our business in China and the performance of our Chinese subsidiary.\nFinally, violation of export control regulations, including those pertaining to China, could subject us to fines and other penalties, such as losing the ability to export for a period of years, which would limit our revenue growth opportunities and significantly hinder our attempts to expand our business internationally. Although we take steps to monitor and ensure our compliance with all applicable export laws and regulations, we are nevertheless exposed to political and regulatory risks that we may not be able to mitigate fully and that may have a material adverse effect upon our international business operations.\nOur operations within China subject us to risks and uncertainties relating to the laws and regulations of China.\nOur business and operations within China may be adversely affected by China\u2019s continuously evolving internal policies, laws and regulations, including those relating to nuclear technology, trade, taxation, import and export tariffs or restrictions, currency controls, cybersecurity and data protection, indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic nuclear industry, and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements in China may be inconsistent. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies, international trade policies and relations, or U.S. - China relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property to risk of loss, increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import duties or tariffs, restrictions on imports or exports, currency revaluations, or retaliatory actions by the Chinese government in response to U.S. actions, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results.\nCustomer concentration in the U.S. nuclear power industry subjects us to risks and uncertainty, which we may not be able to mitigate through diversification.\nThe U.S. nuclear industry has significant customer concentration with a limited number of entities owning all of the 99 nuclear reactors currently operating in the United States. In 2020, we continued to experience high customer concentration with respect to each of our businesses. Indeed, one customer accounted for 14.1% of our total consolidated revenue for the year-ended December 31, 2020. We monitor our customer concentration and seek to diversify our customer base within this concentrated industry. In addition to pursuing diversification strategies and expanding relationships with targeted customers, we mitigate the associated customer concentration risk by developing meaningful relationships with each nuclear power plant, which are often separately responsible for vendor selection and individual procurement decisions.\nWhile our acquisition activity has the potential to diversify our customer base through inorganic means, we have also found that some of the strongest commercial opportunities are within our existing customer base, as our existing relationships are a resource for introductions, due diligence, and business intelligence. Our acquisition of DP Engineering highlights these kinds of opportunities and challenges. Through the acquisition process, we benefited from insights obtained from our subsidiaries who work side-by-side with DP Engineering within our existing footprint. At the same time, DP Engineering has significant customer concentration within our existing customer base. As a result, our strategy with DP Engineering includes a focus on new customer acquisition and diversification.\nOur revenue, results of operations, and cash flows may suffer upon the loss of a significant customer.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, four customers have provided more than 10% of Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting segment\u2019s revenues:\nHyperspring and Absolute, which together comprise our Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting segment, may lose a significant customer if any existing contract with such customer expires without extension, renewal, or negotiation or if it is terminated by the customer prior to expiration, to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract. A number of Hyperspring\u2019s and Absolute\u2019s contracts typically are subject to expiration during each year, and either company may lose any of these contracts if the Company is unable to extend, renew, or renegotiate the contracts. The loss of any significant customer would adversely affect our Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting segment\u2019s revenue, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, a customer has provided more than 10% of Performance Improvement Solutions segment\u2019s revenues:\nCustomer A also provided 14.1% and 27.8% of our total consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. While the acquisition of DP Engineering increased our product and service offerings, we anticipate that it will further increase our customer concentration in our Performance Improvement Solutions segment.\nGSE Performance Solutions, Inc., GSE True North Consulting, LLC, and DP Engineering, which together comprise our Performance Improvement Solutions segment, may lose a significant customer if any existing contract with such customer expires without extension, renewal, or negotiation or if it is terminated by the customer prior to expiration, to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract. A majority of the contracts entered into by our Performance Improvement Solutions businesses are able to be terminated by our customer on relatively short notice without cause or further compensation. The loss of any significant customer would adversely affect our Performance Improvement Solutions segment\u2019s revenue, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur expense levels are based upon our expectations as to future revenue, and we may be unable to adjust spending to compensate for a revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any revenue shortfall would likely have a disproportionate effect on our operating results.\nOur revenue was $57.6 million and $83.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We had operating loss of $9.5 million and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, including purchasing patterns, timing of launch or release of new products and enhancements by us and our competitors, and fluctuating global economic conditions. Because our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future revenue and includes certain fixed, pre-negotiated, and prepaid costs, we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any revenue shortfall. Because of this lag in response time, such revenue shortfalls likely would have a disproportionate adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and may not be a reliable indicator of future revenues or earnings.\nBacklog represents products or services that our customers have committed by contract or purchase order to purchase from us and that we have not yet delivered or recognized as revenue. Our backlog as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $40.4 million and $52.7 million, respectively. There can be no assurance that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. Because of project cancellations or changes in project scope and schedule, we cannot predict with certainty whether or when backlog services will be performed, or products delivered. In addition, even where a project proceeds as scheduled, it is possible that contracted parties may default and fail to pay amounts owed to us. Our poor project performance could increase the cost associated with a project. Thus, delays, suspensions, cancellations, payment defaults, scope changes and poor project execution could materially reduce or eliminate the revenues and profits that we actually realize from projects in backlog. Reductions in our backlog due to cancellation or modification by a customer or for other reasons may adversely affect, potentially to a material extent, the revenues and earnings we actually receive from contracts and orders included in our backlog. Many, but not all, of the contracts in our backlog provide for cancellation fees in the event customers cancel projects. These cancellation fees usually provide for reimbursement of our out-of-pocket costs and payments, for work performed prior to cancellation including varying percentages of the profits we would have realized had the contract been completed. We usually have no contractual right to payment for all of the lost revenue or lost profits in the event of cancellation of the contracts and orders reflected in our backlog, however. Projects may remain in our backlog for extended periods of time. If we experience significant project terminations, suspensions, or scope adjustments to contracts reflected in our backlog, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted.\nWe are currently a party to multiple fixed price contracts and will continue to enter into similar contracts in the future. If we are not able to estimate accurately or control costs on such projects, the profitability of such projects could be reduced.\nA significant portion of our revenue is attributable to contracts entered into on a fixed price basis, which enable us to benefit from cost savings, but expose us to the risk of cost overruns. If our initial estimates are incorrect regarding our costs of performance under these contracts, or if unanticipated circumstances arise, we could experience cost overruns that could result in reduced profits or even net losses on these contracts. Our financial condition is dependent upon our ability to maximize our earnings from our contracts. Lower earnings or losses caused by cost overruns could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nUnder our time and materials contracts, we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses. Under cost-reimbursable contracts, which are subject to a contract ceiling amount, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and are paid a fee, which may be fixed, or performance based. In both cases, however, if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs even under a time and materials or cost-reimbursable contract.\nOur inability to successfully estimate and manage costs on each of these contract types may materially and adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur simulation business is dependent on product innovation and research and development, which costs are incurred prior to realization of revenue for new products and improvements.\nWe believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line, develop new products, maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer needs. Our product development activities are aimed at the development and expansion of our library of software modeling tools, the improvement of our display systems and workstation technologies, and the advancement and upgrading of our simulation technology. The life cycles for software modeling tools, graphical user interfaces, and simulation technology are variable and largely determined by competitive pressures and the evolution of software and standards that may be controlled by third parties. Consequently, we will need to continue to make significant investments in research and development to enhance and expand our capabilities in these areas and to maintain our competitive advantage. We cannot control, and we may be unable to predict accurately, the development and evolution of these competitive pressures and external software and standards. We may be unable to monetize our investment in research and development in a timely manner, or at all. Unexpected or excessive delays in realizing a return on these investments may have a material and adverse effect on our cash position, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe use derivative instruments in the normal course of our business which could result in financial losses and exposure to other risks that negatively impact our net income (loss) and business operational efficiency.\nWe periodically enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage market risks associated with the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on foreign-denominated trade receivables. We could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or if a derivative instrument counterparty fails to perform. We attempt to minimize credit exposure by limiting counterparties to internationally recognized financial institutions, but even these counterparties are subject to default and contract risk and this risk is beyond our control. We also engage in interest rate hedging transactions in the ordinary courses of our business to mitigate the risk that amounts borrowed under our credit facility at floating interest rates may be affected by adverse rate movements. Depending on future business, market, and interest rate environments, however, these hedging transactions may not be effective to mitigate the financial impact of the risks for which they were put into place sufficiently to justify their expense. Additionally, we may need or wish to avail ourselves of other forms of hedging or derivative instruments in the future depending on our business needs, and these other types of derivative instruments may be subject to the same and other risks and may not be available to us on a cost-effective or risk-controlled basis, if at all. The unavailability of viable and cost effective risk management, hedging, or similar instruments now or in the future could adversely impact our business operational efficiency or results.\nWe issue performance, advance payment, and bid bonds in the normal course of our business which could result in financial losses that negatively impact our net income (loss).\nWe may be required to issue performance, advance payment, and bid bonds to our customers and potential customers as a normal part of our business activities. Our customers may have the ability to draw upon these performance bonds in the event we fail to cure a material breach of the contract within a specified period after receiving notice from the customer regarding the nature of the breach. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we did not issue any advance payment or performance bonds, but we may be required to do so in the future to secure contract awards.\nWe rely upon our intellectual property rights for the success of our business, but the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate.\nAlthough we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are important to establishing and maintaining a technological leadership position, our business depends, in part, on the strength of our intellectual property rights in our proprietary technology and information. We rely upon a combination of trade secret, copyright, and trademark law, contractual arrangements and technical means to protect our intellectual property rights. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, joint venture and alliance partners, customers, and other third parties that are granted access to our proprietary information, and we limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. There can be no assurance, however, that we have protected or will be able to protect our proprietary technology and information adequately, that the unauthorized disclosure or use of our proprietary information will be prevented, that others have not or will not develop similar technology or information independently, or, to the extent we own any patents in the future, that others have not or will not be able to design around those future patents. Furthermore, the laws of certain countries in which our products are sold do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Our inability to protect our intellectual property rights from infringement, dilution, or loss could make it more difficult for us to generate revenue from the offer, licensure, and sale of our products and services and could enable third parties to compete with us more effectively.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive. This competition may prevent us from raising prices at the same pace at which our costs increase.\nOur businesses operate in highly competitive environments with both domestic and foreign competitors, many of whom have substantially greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do. The principal factors affecting competition in our industries include price, technological proficiency, ease of system configuration and use, product reliability, applications expertise, engineering support, local presence, personal relationships, and the relative financial stability of the competitor. We believe competition in the simulation fields may further intensify in the future as a result of advances in technology, consolidations and strategic alliances among competitors, increased costs required to develop new technology and the increasing importance of software content in systems and products. Because our business has a significant international component, changes in the value of the dollar could adversely affect our ability to compete internationally and could reduce our profitability on international business opportunities that we do win. Any of these competitive factors, or any combination of two or more factors, could make it more difficult for us to bid successfully on new projects, or to complete projects at profit margins that we consider reasonable. An inability or reduced ability to win new work would have a material adverse impact on our backlog and revenue, and an inability or reduced ability to secure reasonable profit margins on projects awarded to us would have a material adverse impact on our profitability and overall results of operations.\nWe may encounter difficulties in effectively integrating acquired businesses.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have acquired, and intend to acquire, companies with compatible or related products. These acquisitions will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies, which include, among other things:\n\u2022\npotential exposure to unknown liabilities of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\nhigher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses;\n\u2022\ndepletion of cash and other company assets and resources in connection with the acquisition or integration;\n\u2022\ndifficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the companies, especially if the acquired operations are geographically distant or culturally different;\n\u2022\npotential disruption of our ongoing business and diversion of management time and attention;\n\u2022\nfailure to maximize our financial and strategic position by the successful incorporation of acquired technology;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in adopting and maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures, and policies;\n\u2022\nloss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management; and\n\u2022\npossible dilution to our shareholders.\nWe may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any of our acquisitions, and if we are not successful, our financial results may be materially impacted. We may be forced to modify our strategic objectives or seek alternative sources of growth.\nWe are dependent on our management team, and the loss of or the inability to attract and retain one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued services and continuing contributions of our executive officers and other key personnel. All of our recently acquired businesses, including Hyperspring, Absolute, True North, and DP Engineering, are particularly dependent on key personnel and their key strategic relationships. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key personnel could harm our business. Our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees. If we are not able to attract and retain key skilled personnel, our business could be harmed and our revenue, profitability, and overall results of operations could be materially impacted.\nA failure to attract and retain technical personnel could reduce our revenue and our operational effectiveness.\nThere is a continuing demand for qualified technical personnel in the industries within which we operate. We believe that our future growth and success will depend upon our ability to attract, train and retain such personnel. Our design and development efforts, particularly within our Performance Improvement Solutions business segment, depend on hiring and retaining qualified technical personnel. An inability to attract or maintain a sufficient number of technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our contract performance or on our ability to capitalize on market opportunities.\nThe nuclear power industry, our largest customer group, is associated with a number of hazards which could create significant liabilities.\nOur business could expose us to third party claims with respect to product, environmental and other similar liabilities. Although we have sought protection from these potential liabilities through a variety of legal and contractual provisions as well as through liability insurance, the effectiveness of such protections has not been fully tested. Certain of our products and services are used by the nuclear power industry primarily in operator training. Although our contracts for such products and services typically contain provisions designed to protect us from potential liabilities associated with such use, there can be no assurance that we would not be materially adversely affected by claims or actions which may potentially arise due to factors that may be outside of our direct control.\nCyber security incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nGlobal cyber security threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats. While we employ comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems), cyber security incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cyber security incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, civil or regulatory liability for loss of sensitive or protected information such as personal data, incident response costs, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, loss of intellectual property, and increased cyber security protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.\nThird-party claims that we allegedly infringe the intellectual property rights of others may be costly to defend or settle and could damage our business.\nWe cannot be certain that our software and services do not infringe issued patents, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights of third parties. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time, including claims of alleged infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our licensees concerning their use of our software products and integration technologies and services. Third parties may bring claims of infringement directly against us, or because our software is integrated with our customers\u2019 networks and business processes, as well as other software applications against us, our customers, and our business partners or software suppliers, if the cause of the alleged infringement cannot easily be determined.\nClaims of alleged infringement may have a material adverse effect on our business and may discourage potential customers from doing business with us on acceptable terms, if at all, even if the claims are ultimately adjudicated to have no merit, dismissed, or settled. Defending against claims of infringement may be time-consuming and may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, including our management\u2019s attention to our business. Furthermore, a party making an infringement claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages. A judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from selling our software or require that we re-engineer some or all of our products or modules. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to enter costly royalty or license agreements. We may be unable to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed significantly if any of these events were to occur, and the price of our common stock could be adversely affected. In addition, we have agreed, and may agree in the future, to indemnify certain of our customers against claims that our software infringes upon the intellectual property rights of others. Although we carry general liability insurance, our current insurance coverage may not apply to, and likely would not protect us entirely or at all from, liability that may be imposed under any of the types of claims described above.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations, and these may change.\nOur businesses are subject to regulation by U.S. federal and state laws, and foreign laws, government regulations and policies, and other administrative requirements. Changes to laws or regulations may require us to modify our business objectives if existing practices become more restricted, subject to escalating costs, or prohibited outright. Particular risks include possible curtailment of our intended business activities or strategies as a result of changed or new regulatory risks arising from federal laws and regulations, such as laws and regulations regarding export of sensitive technologies or technical information or changed interpretations of existing laws and regulations. Our business and the industries in which we operate are also at times being reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties, or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages. Any significant change to laws, regulations, enforcement policies, or liability regimes, or other actions by government bodies having jurisdiction over our business, may have material adverse effects on our business and profitability. We have only limited ability to foresee, plan for, or influence changes to these requirements.\nProvisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if that change may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.\nThe existence of some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a stockholder may consider favorable. These include provisions:\n\u2022\nproviding that our Board of Directors fixes the number of members of the board and fills all vacancies on the Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nproviding for the division of our Board of Directors into three classes with staggered terms;\n\u2022\nlimiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring stockholder action to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nestablishing supermajority vote requirements for certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022\nlimiting the right of stockholders to remove directors; and\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our Board of Directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our Board of Directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for shares of our common stock.\nWe believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal and are not intended to make our company immune from takeovers. These provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders, however, and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of our company and our stockholders.\nA sustained decline in the price of our common stock or weaker than forecasted operating results could result in write-downs of goodwill and other intangible assets and capitalized software development costs.\nIn conjunction with business acquisitions, we record goodwill and other intangible assets and review their fair value for impairment annually as of December 31, or on an interim basis if impairment indicators are present, such as a significant reduction in our market capitalization, significant declines in operating performance or disruptions to the business that could reduce our future cash flow. On November 14, 2014, we recorded $5.6 million of goodwill related to our acquisition of Hyperspring. On September 20, 2017, we recorded $2.8 million of goodwill related to our acquisition of Absolute. On May 11, 2018, we recorded $4.7 million of goodwill related to our acquisition of True North, LLC. On February 15, 2019, we recorded $5.8 million of goodwill related the acquisition of DP Engineering. Following the February 23, 2019 event occurring at DP Engineering\u2019s largest customer and subsequent receipt of the Notice of Suspension on February 28, 2019. The Company determined that the notice of suspension was a triggering event necessitating an interim assessment of a potential impairment of definite-lived intangible assets and goodwill. The Company recognized an impairment charge of $5.6 million to write down goodwill on DP Engineering on at March 31, 2019. We used a discounted cash flow analysis to test for impairment and concluded that the carrying value of the definite-lived intangible assets of DP Engineering exceeded its fair value by $4.3 million, and we recorded an impairment for this amount as of the three months ended March 31, 2020. We can provide no assurance that we will not have an impairment charge in future periods as the result of changing conditions. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding our goodwill.\nWe capitalize certain computer software development costs and, accordingly, the capitalized costs are reported on our balance sheet. Capitalization of computer software development costs begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility. Capitalization ceases and amortization of capitalized costs begins when the software product is commercially available for general release to customers. Amortization of capitalized computer software development costs is included in cost of revenue and is determined using the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product, typically three years. On an annual basis, and more frequently as conditions indicate, we assess the status of our development programs and the recoverability of the unamortized software development costs by estimating the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the sale of the product. If the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the unamortized software costs, we will write-down these costs to their estimated fair value based on the future undiscounted cash flows. The excess of any unamortized computer software costs over the related net realizable value is written down and charged to operations.\nWrite-down of goodwill and capitalized software development costs in the current and future accounting periods may have an impact on the value of the Company, results of operations, and price of our common stock.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss (NOL) carryforward and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards, and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income or tax liabilities may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.", "PERMNO": 81869, "SIC": 7361, "TIC": "GVP"}
