Any of the risks and uncertainties described below, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects for growth, and the value of an investment in our common stock. In addition, these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K (please read the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements appearing at the beginning of this Form 10-K). The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and the value of an investment in our common stock and could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to Development and Commercialization of our Product Candidates\nOur near term prospects are highly dependent on the success of our most advanced product candidate, ARIKAYCE. If we are unable to successfully complete the development of, obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize ARIKAYCE, our business, financial condition, results of operations, the value of our common stock and our prospects may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are investing substantially all of our efforts and financial resources in the development of ARIKAYCE, our most advanced product candidate. Our ability to generate product revenue from ARIKAYCE will depend heavily on the successful completion of development of, receipt of regulatory approval for, and commercialization of, ARIKAYCE.\nPositive results from preclinical studies of a drug candidate may not be predictive of similar results in human clinical trials, and promising results from earlier clinical trials of a drug candidate may not be replicated in later clinical trials. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in earlier stages of development. Accordingly, the results of the completed clinical trials for ARIKAYCE may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in our clinical trials currently in progress or other trials. In addition, even if we believe our clinical trials demonstrate promising results, regulators may decline to grant regulatory approval-conditional or otherwise. Further, even if we subsequently obtain conditional approval, it may be withdrawn under certain circumstances and confirmatory clinical studies may be required and could fail to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain full approval.\nWe are conducting a global phase 3 clinical study of ARIKAYCE (the 212 or CONVERT study) in adult non-CF patients with NTM lung infections caused by MAC that are refractory to treatment. The CONVERT study is designed to confirm the culture conversion results seen in our phase 2 clinical trial (the 112 study). CONVERT study subjects who are non-converters by Month 6 may be eligible to enter a separate 12-month open-label study (the 312 study). The primary objective of the 312 study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of ARIKAYCE in combination with a standard multi-drug regimen. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate with statistical significance that our drug product candidates are effective for the proposed indications, or may fail to establish adequate safety. Such failure may cause us to abandon a drug product candidate and may delay development of other drug product candidates.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we filed an MAA with the EMA for ARIKAYCE as a treatment for NTM lung disease in adult patients and for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with Pseudomonas lung\ninfections. The filing was based on data from our phase 3 study in CF patients with Pseudomonas and our phase 2 study in patients with NTM. In February 2015, the EMA validated our MAA as complete for review. The EMA subsequently requested additional information with respect to the CF indication regarding the similarity of ARIKAYCE to another product that has an orphan designation for the same Pseudomonas indication. In the third quarter of 2015, the EMA adopted our request to withdraw the Pseudomonas indication from our MAA. In April 2016, we submitted our written responses to the EMA's 180-day list of outstanding issues (LOI). In May 2016, we participated in an oral explanation meeting with the CHMP for the NTM indication to address the LOI. After the oral explanation meeting, the CHMP concluded that the data submitted did not provide enough evidence to support an approval. In June 2016, we withdrew our MAA. We intend to resubmit our MAA when sufficient clinical data are available.\nWe do not expect ARIKAYCE or any other drug candidates we may develop to be commercially available in any market until we receive requisite approval from the FDA, EMA or equivalent regulatory agency. The failure to obtain such approvals may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, the value of our common stock and our prospects.\nWe may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals for ARIKAYCE or any other products we develop in the US, Europe or other countries. If we fail to obtain such approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our products.\nWe are required to obtain various regulatory approvals prior to studying our products in humans and then again before we market and distribute our products, and the failure to do so will prevent us from commercializing our products, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and the value of our common stock. The regulatory review and approval processes in both the US and Europe require evaluation of preclinical studies and clinical studies, as well as the evaluation of our manufacturing process. These processes are complex, lengthy, expensive, resource intensive and uncertain. Securing regulatory approval to market our products requires the submission of much more extensive preclinical and clinical data, manufacturing information regarding the process and facility, scientific data characterizing our product and other supporting data to the regulatory authorities in order to establish its safety and effectiveness. This process also is complex, lengthy, expensive, resource intensive and uncertain. We have limited experience in submitting and pursuing applications necessary to gain these regulatory approvals.\nData submitted to the regulators is subject to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory agency approval. We may also encounter delays or rejections based on changes in regulatory agency policies during the period in which we develop a product and the period required for review of any application for regulatory agency approval of a particular product. For example, FDA has designated ARIKAYCE for fast track, breakthrough therapy and QIDP status, all programs intended to expedite or streamline the development and regulatory review of the drug. If we were to lose the current designation under one or more of those programs, we could face delays in the FDA review and approval process. Resolving such delays could force us or third parties to incur significant costs, could limit our allowed activities or the allowed activities of third parties, could diminish any competitive advantages that we or our third parties may attain or could adversely affect our ability to receive royalties, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Even with these designations, there is no guarantee we will receive approval for ARIKAYCE on a timely basis, or at all. Similarly, we are defining our regulatory strategies to potentially secure US and EU orphan drug designations and expedite the development and regulatory review of INS1007 through programs such as US fast track designation and breakthrough therapy, but we may be unable to obtain them. In addition, although we believe that INS1009 could be eligible for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, and thus could rely at least in part on studies not\nconducted by or for us and for which we do not have a right of reference, we may not obtain approval from the FDA to use this pathway.\nApproval by the FDA or the EMA does not ensure approval by the regulatory authorities of other countries. To market our products outside of the US and Europe we, and potentially our third party providers, must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries. The approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in these other territories might differ from that required to obtain FDA or EMA approval. In addition, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions (including with respect to our target market) and criminal prosecution if we fail to comply with applicable US and foreign regulatory requirements.\nWe have not completed the research and development stage of ARIKAYCE or any other product candidates. If we are unable to successfully commercialize ARIKAYCE or any other products, it may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, the value of our common stock and our prospects.\nOur long-term viability and growth depend on the successful commercialization of ARIKAYCE and potentially other product candidates. Pharmaceutical product development is an expensive, high risk, lengthy, complicated, resource intensive process. In order to conduct the development programs for our products, we must, among other things, be able to successfully:\n\u00b7 Identify potential product candidates; \u00b7 Design and conduct appropriate laboratory, preclinical and other research; \u00b7 Submit for and receive regulatory approval to perform clinical studies; \u00b7 Design and conduct appropriate preclinical and clinical studies according to GLP and GCP and disease-specific expectations of the FDA and other regulatory bodies; \u00b7 Select and recruit clinical investigators and subjects for our studies; \u00b7 Collect, analyze and correctly interpret the data from our studies; \u00b7 Submit for and receive regulatory approvals for marketing; \u00b7 Submit for and receive reimbursement approvals for market access: and \u00b7 Manufacture the product candidates and device components according to cGMP.\nThe development program with respect to any given product will take many years and thus delay our ability to generate profits associated with that product. In addition, potential products that appear promising at early stages of development may fail for a number of reasons, including the possibility that the products may require significant additional testing or turn out to be unsafe, ineffective, too difficult or expensive to develop or manufacture, too difficult to administer or unstable, or regulators may require additional testing to substantiate our claims. If we do not proceed with the development of our ARIKAYCE program in the NTM lung disease or CF indications, certain organizations that provided funding to us for such developmental efforts may elect to proceed with the development of these indications. Even if we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, including ARIKAYCE, we may not obtain labeling that permits us to market them with commercially viable claims because the final wording of the approved indication may be restrictive, or the available clinical data may not provide adequate comparative data with other products. Failure to successfully commercialize our products will adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, the value of our common stock, and our prospects.\nIf our clinical studies do not produce positive results or our clinical trials are delayed, or if serious side effects are identified during drug development, we may experience delays, incur additional costs and ultimately be unable to commercialize our product candidates in the US, Europe, Japan or other countries.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct, at our own expense, extensive preclinical tests to demonstrate the safety of our product candidates in animals, and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans.\nPreclinical and clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement and can take many years to complete. Special challenges can arise in conducting trials in diseases or conditions with small populations, such as difficulties enrolling adequate numbers of patients. Our product development costs have and may continue to increase if we experience further delays in testing or approvals. A failure of one or more of our preclinical studies or clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, preclinical testing and the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent our ability to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u00b7 Our preclinical tests or clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional preclinical testing or clinical trials or we may abandon projects that we expect to be promising; \u00b7 Regulators or institutional review boards (IRBs) may prevent us from commencing a clinical trial or conducting a clinical trial at a prospective trial site; \u00b7 Enrollment in the clinical trials may take longer than expected or the clinical trials as designed may not allow for sufficient patient accrual to complete enrollment of the trial; \u00b7 We may experience diffculties or delays due to the number of clinical sites involved in our clinical trials; \u00b7 We may decide to limit or abandon our commercial development programs; \u00b7 Conditions imposed on us by the FDA or any non-US regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials may require us to collect and submit information to regulatory authorities, ethics committees, IRBs or others for review and approval; \u00b7 The number of patients required for our clinical trials may be larger than we anticipate or participants may drop out of our clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate; \u00b7 Our third party contractors, contract research organizations, which we refer to as CROs, clinical investigators, clinical laboratories, product supplier or inhalation device supplier may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or fail to meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner; \u00b7 We may have to suspend or terminate one or more of our clinical trials if we, the regulators or the IRBs determine that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or for other reasons; \u00b7 We may not be able to claim that a product candidate provides an advantage over current standard of care or future competitive therapies in development because our clinical studies may not have been designed to support such claims; \u00b7 Regulators or IRBs may require that we hold, suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including potential safety concerns or noncompliance with regulatory requirements; \u00b7 The cost of our clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate; \u00b7 The supply or quality of product used in clinical trials or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical trials may be insufficient or inadequate or we may not be able to reach agreements on acceptable terms with prospective contract manufacturers or CROs; \u00b7 The effects of our product candidates may not be the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects or the product candidates may have other unexpected characteristics; \u00b7 Shortening of the patent protection period during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates; and \u00b7 Our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do.\nFor example, results from our rat carcinogenicity study showed that when rats were given ARIKAYCE daily by inhalation for two years, two of the 120 rats receiving the highest dose developed lung carcinomas. These rats received ARIKAYCE doses that were within two-fold of those in clinical studies (normalized on a body surface area basis or a lung weight basis). Based on these results, in 2011 the FDA placed clinical holds on our phase 3 clinical trials for ARIKAYCE, which holds were lifted in 2012. Approvability or labeling of ARIKAYCE may be negatively affected by the results from this rat carcinogenicity study. In addition, we withdrew our MAA for ARIKAYCE in June 2016 after the CHMP concluded the data underlying it did not provide enough evidence to support approval, thereby delaying approval and commercialization of ARIKAYCE in Europe.\nSignificant preclinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten the patent protection period during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates. Such delays could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our products or product candidates.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trials or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u00b7 Experience increased product development costs, as we have in the past; \u00b7 Be delayed in obtaining, or be unable to obtain, marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates; \u00b7 Obtain approval for indications that are not as broad as intended or entirely different than those indications for which we sought approval; \u00b7 Have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval; or \u00b7 Face a shortened patent protection period during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe have limited experience in conducting and managing the preclinical development activities and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including approval by the FDA and EMA and other regulatory agencies.\nWe have limited experience in conducting and managing the preclinical development activities and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including approval by the FDA and EMA. Since our merger with Transave, we have not completed a regulatory filing and review process for, obtained regulatory approval of or commercialized any of our product candidates. Our limited experience might prevent us from successfully designing, implementing, or completing a clinical trial. The application processes for the FDA, EMA and other regulatory agencies are complex and difficult and vary by regulatory agency. We have limited experience in conducting and managing the application processes necessary to obtain regulatory approvals in the various countries and we might not be able to demonstrate that our product candidates meet the appropriate standards for regulatory approval. If we are not successful in conducting and managing our preclinical development activities or clinical trials or obtaining regulatory approvals, we might not be able to commercialize ARIKAYCE, or might be significantly delayed in doing so, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, the value of our common stock and our prospects.\nWe may not be able to enroll enough patients to complete our clinical trials or retain a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials to generate the data necessary for regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nThe completion rate of our clinical studies is dependent on, among other factors, the patient enrollment rate. Patient enrollment is a function of many factors, including:\n\u00b7 Investigator identification and recruitment; \u00b7 Regulatory approvals to initiate study sites; \u00b7 Patient population size; \u00b7 The nature of the protocol to be used in the trial; \u00b7 Patient proximity to clinical sites; \u00b7 Eligibility criteria for the study; \u00b7 The patients' willingness to participate in the study; \u00b7 Discontinue rates; and \u00b7 Competition from other companies' potential clinical studies for the same patient population\nDelays in patient enrollment for future clinical trials, such as those we encountered in enrolling the CONVERT study, could increase costs and delay ultimate commercialization and sales, if any, of our products. We achieved our enrollment objective for the CONVERT study in the fourth quarter of 2016. The CONVERT study was designed to enroll enough subjects to ensure a sufficient number of patients are evaluable for the primary endpoint. Once enrolled, patients may elect to discontinue participation in a clinical trial at any time. If patients elect to discontinue participation in our clinical trials at a higher rate than expected, we may be unable to generate the data required by regulators for approval of our product candidates.\nThe commercial success of ARIKAYCE or any other product candidates that we may develop will depend upon many factors, including the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payers and others in the medical community.\nEven if we are able to successfully complete development of, obtain regulatory approval for, and bring our product candidates to market, they may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payers and others in the medical community. If ARIKAYCE, or any other product candidate we bring to market, does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of ARIKAYCE and any other product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 The prevalence and severity of any side effects, including any limitations or warnings contained in a product's approved labeling; \u00b7 The efficacy and potential advantages over alternative treatments; \u00b7 The pricing of our product candidates; \u00b7 Relative convenience and ease of administration; \u00b7 The willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies; \u00b7 The strength of marketing and distribution support and timing of market introduction of competitive products; \u00b7 Publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments, including competing products becoming subject to generic pricing; and \u00b7 Sufficient third party insurance coverage and reimbursement.\nEven if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in preclinical and clinical trials, market acceptance of the product will not be known until after it is launched. For example, if a clinical trial is not designed to demonstrate advantages over alternative treatments, we may be prohibited from promoting our product candidates on any such advantages. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payers on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful. Such efforts to educate the marketplace may require more resources than are required to commercialize more established technologies marketed by our competitors.\nWe currently have a very small marketing or sales organization, and we have limited experience as a company in marketing drug products. If we are unable to establish our own marketing and sales capabilities, or are unable to enter into agreements with third parties, to market and sell our products after they are approved, our ability to generate product revenues will be adversely affected.\nWe have a small commercial organization for the marketing, market access, sales and distribution of our products. In order to commercialize ARIKAYCE or any other product candidates, we must develop these capabilities on our own or make arrangements with third parties for the marketing, sales and distribution of our products. The establishment and development of our own sales force will be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch, and we may be unable to successfully develop this capability. As a result, we may seek one or more partners to handle some or all of the sales and marketing of ARIKAYCE in certain markets. However, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with third parties to sell ARIKAYCE on favorable terms or at all. In the event we are unable to develop our own marketing, market access, and sales force or collaborate with a third-party marketing, market access, and sales organization, we may not be able to successfully commercialize ARIKAYCE or any other product candidates that we develop, which would adversely affect our ability to generate product revenues. Further, whether we commercialize products on our own or rely on a third party to do so, our ability to generate revenue will be dependent on the effectiveness of the sales force.\nWe have limited experience operating internationally, are subject to a number of risks associated with our international activities and operations and may not be successful in our efforts to expand internationally.\nWe currently have limited operations outside of the US. As of December 31, 2016, we had 21 employees located in Europe, and we have suppliers located around the world. In order to meet our long-term goals, we will need to grow our international operations over the next several years, including in Japan, and continue to source material used in the manufacture of our product candidates from abroad. Consequently, we are and will continue to be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries, including:\n\u00b7 Our limited experience operating our business internationally; \u00b7 An inability to achieve the optimal pricing and reimbursement for ARIKAYCE or subsequent changes in reimbursement, pricing and other regulatory requirements; \u00b7 Any implementation of, or changes to, tariffs, trade barriers and other import-export regulations in the US or other countries in which we operate; \u00b7 Unexpected adverse events related to ARIKAYCE or our other product candidates occurring in foreign markets that we have not experienced in the US; \u00b7 Economic and political conditions, including geopolitical events, such as war and terrorism, foreign currency fluctuations and inflation, which could result in increased or unpredictable operating expenses and reduced revenues and other obligations incident to doing business in, or with a company located in, another country;\n\u00b7 Changes resulting from (i) the uncertainty and instability in economic and market conditions caused by the UK's vote to exit the European Union; and (ii) the uncertainty regarding how the UK's access to the EU Single Market and the wider trading, legal, regulatory and labor environments, especially in the UK and European Union, will be impacted by the UK's vote to exit the European Union, including the resulting impact on our business; and \u00b7 Compliance with foreign or US laws, rules and regulations, including data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import, export and trade restrictions, anti- bribery/anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules, which could lead to actions by us or our licensees, distributors, manufacturers, other third parties who act on our behalf or with whom we do business in foreign countries or our employees who are working abroad that could subject us to investigation or prosecution under such foreign or US laws.\nThese and other risks associated with our international operations may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and the value of our common stock.\nIf estimates of the size of the potential markets for our product candidates are overstated or regulators limit the proposed treatment population for our product candidates, our ability to commercialize such product candidates successfully or achieve sufficient revenue to support our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have relied on market research, funded by us and third parties, and certain government publications to estimate the potential market opportunity for NTM lung disease and we expect to do so in the future with respect to market opportunities for other product candidates. Development of such estimates, however, necessarily requires a number of assumptions subject to significant judgment, and such assumptions, as well as the resulting market opportunity estimates, could prove to be inaccurate. In addition, a potential market opportunity could be reduced if a regulator limits the proposed treatment population for a product candidate. In such circumstances, even if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, we may be unable to commercialize it on a scale sufficient to generate material revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, the value of our common stock and our prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties including collaborators, CROs, clinical and analytical laboratories, CMOs and other providers for many services that are critical to our business. If we are unable to form and sustain these relationships, or if any third-party arrangements that we may enter into are unsuccessful, including due to non-compliance by such third parties with our agreements or applicable law, our ability to develop and commercialize our products may be materially adversely affected.\nWe currently rely, and expect that we will in the future continue to rely, on third parties for significant research, analytical services, preclinical development, clinical development and manufacturing of our product candidates. For example, almost all of our clinical trial work is done by CROs, such as Synteract, our CRO for both the 212 and 312 studies, and clinical laboratories. Reliance on these third parties poses a number of risks, including the following:\n\u00b7 Significant competition in seeking appropriate partners; \u00b7 The complex and time-consuming nature of negotiation, documentation and implementation of agreements with third parties in the pharmaceutical industry; \u00b7 Our potential inability to establish and implement collaborations or other alternative arrangements that we might pursue on favorable terms;\n\u00b7 Our potential inability to control whether third parties devote sufficient resources to our programs or products, including with respect to meeting contractual deadlines; \u00b7 Our potential inability to control the regulatory and contractual compliance of third parties, including their processes and procedures, systems utilized to collect and analyze data, and equipment used to test drug product and/or clinical supplies; \u00b7 Disagreements with third parties, including CROs, that result in a dispute over and loss of intellectual property rights, delay or termination of research, development, or commercialization of product candidates or litigation or arbitration; \u00b7 Contracts with our collaborators that fail to provide sufficient protection of our intellectual property; and \u00b7 Difficulty enforcing the contracts if one of these third parties fails to perform.\nSuch risks could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, the value of our common stock and our prospects.\nWe may not have, or may be unable to obtain, sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet our required supply for clinical studies or commercialization requirements, which would materially harm our business.\nWe do not have any in-house manufacturing capability other than for development and characterization and depend completely on a small number of third-party manufacturers and suppliers for the manufacture of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. For instance, we are and expect to remain dependent upon Althea and Therapure being able to provide an adequate supply of ARIKAYCE both for our clinical trials and for commercial sale in the event ARIKAYCE receives marketing approvals. Althea currently manufactures ARIKAYCE at a relatively small scale. In order to meet potential commercial demand, if ARIKAYCE is approved, we have constructed a manufacturing operation at Therapure in Canada that operates at a larger scale. We may not be able to secure an alternative source of ARIKAYCE at an adequate scale of production should either of these suppliers be unable to provide us with ARIKAYCE.\nWe are also dependent upon PARI being able to provide an adequate supply of nebulizers both for our clinical trials and for commercial sale in the event ARIKAYCE receives marketing approval, as PARI is the sole manufacturer of the eFlow Nebulizer System. We have no alternative supplier for the Device, and we do not intend to seek an alternative or secondary supplier. Significant effort and time were expended in the optimization of the nebulizer for use with ARIKAYCE. In the event PARI cannot provide us with sufficient quantities of the Device, replication of the optimized device by another party may require considerable time and additional regulatory approval. In the case of certain defined supply failures, we will have the right under the Commercialization Agreement to make the Device and have it made by certain third parties, but not those deemed under the Commercialization Agreement to compete with PARI.\nWe do not have long-term commercial agreements with all of our suppliers and if any of our suppliers are unable or unwilling to perform for any reason, we may not be able to locate suppliers or enter into favorable agreements with them. For instance, an inadequate supply of ARIKAYCE or the Device could delay, impair or prevent clinical trials, the development and commercialization of ARIKAYCE and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, the value of our common stock and our prospects.\nWe also rely on third parties to select and enter into agreements with clinical investigators to conduct clinical trials to support approval of our products and the failure of these third parties to carry out such evaluation and selection can adversely affect the quality of the data from these studies and,\npotentially, the approval of our products. In particular, as part of our new drug approval submissions, we must disclose any financial interests of investigators who participated in any of the clinical studies being submitted in support of approval, or must certify to the absence of such financial interests. The FDA evaluates the information contained in such disclosures to determine whether disclosed interests may have an impact on the reliability of a study. If the FDA determines that financial interests of any clinical investigator raise serious questions of data integrity, the FDA can institute a data audit, request that we submit further data analyses, conduct additional independent studies to confirm the results of the questioned study, or refuse to use the data from the questioned study as a basis for approval. A finding by the FDA that a financial relationship of an investigator raises serious questions of data integrity, could delay or otherwise adversely affect approval of our products.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe have a history of operating losses, and we currently have no material source of revenue. We expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred losses each previous year of our operation, except in 2009, when we sold our manufacturing facility and certain other assets to Merck and we did not generate material revenue in 2016, 2015 or 2014. We expect to continue incurring operating losses for the foreseeable future. The process of developing and commercializing our products requires significant pre-clinical and clinical testing as well as regulatory approvals for commercialization and marketing before we are allowed to begin product sales. In addition, commercialization of our drug candidates likely would require us to significantly expand our sales and marketing organization and establish contractual relationships to enable product manufacturing and other related activities. We expect that our activities, together with our general and administrative expenses, will continue to result in substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2016, our accumulated deficit was $765.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our consolidated net loss was $176.3 million. To achieve and maintain profitability, we need to generate significant revenues from future product sales. The process of developing and commercializing our products will require significant expenditures for pre-clinical and clinical testing, regulatory approvals for commercialization and marketing, development of an internal or external sales and marketing organization and other related activities. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development and commercialization, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses, and we may never generate significant future revenues or achieve and sustain profitability.\nWe will need additional funds in the future to continue our operations, but we face uncertainties with respect to our ability to access capital.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since our inception. We expect to continue to incur substantial research and development expenses, and we expect to expend substantial financial resources to complete development of, seek regulatory approval for, and prepare for commercialization of ARIKAYCE. We will need to seek additional funding in order to complete any clinical trials related to ARIKAYCE, seek regulatory approvals of ARIKAYCE, and commercially launch ARIKAYCE, including due to changes in our product development plans or misjudgment of expected costs. We also may require additional future capital in order to continue our other research and development activities, fund corporate development, maintain our intellectual property portfolio or resolve litigation. As of December 31, 2016, we had $162.6 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand but no committed sources of capital. We do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed, or, if available, that the terms will be favorable. If adequate funds are not available to us when needed, we may be required to reduce or eliminate research and development programs or commercial efforts, which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, as well as the value of our common stock.\nOur loan agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc. (Hercules) contains covenants and other provisions that impose restrictions on our operations, which may adversely affect our ability to optimally operate our business or to maximize shareholder value.\nOur A&R Loan Agreement contains various restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, transfer or place a lien or security interest on our assets, including our intellectual property, merge with or acquire other companies, redeem or repurchase any shares of our capital stock or pay cash dividends to our shareholders. The loan agreement also contains certain other covenants (including limitations on other indebtedness, liens, acquisitions, investments and dividends). Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 5% may be applied to the outstanding loan balances, and the lender may terminate its lending commitment, declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable, and take such other actions as set forth in the A&R Loan Agreement. In addition, pursuant to the A&R Loan Agreement, the lender has the right to participate, in an amount of up to $2.0 million, in a subsequent private financing that involves the issuance of our equity securities.\nThe interest-only period under the A&R Loan Agreement extends through November 1, 2018, and can only be extended up to six months under certain conditions. The maturity date of the loan facility is October 1, 2020. Pursuant to the A&R Loan Agreement, we are required to have a consolidated minimum cash liquidity in an amount no less than $25.0 million. Such requirement terminates upon the earlier of the date by which we complete an equity financing with at least $75.0 million in proceeds or the date we generate and announce data from the CONVERT study in a manner that could support an NDA filing.\nOur borrowings under the A&R Loan Agreement are secured by a lien on our assets, excluding our intellectual property, and in the event of a default on the loan, Hercules may have the right to seize our assets securing our obligations under the A&R Loan Agreement. The terms and restrictions provided for in the A&R Loan Agreement may inhibit our ability to conduct our business and to maximize shareholder value. Future debt securities or other financing arrangements could contain negative covenants similar to, or even more restrictive than, the Hercules loan.\nIn-process research and development (IPRD) currently comprises approximately 24% of our total assets. A reduction in the value of our IPRD could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock.\nAs a result of the merger with Transave in 2010, we recorded an intangible IPRD asset of $77.9 million and goodwill of $6.3 million on our balance sheet. As a result of the clinical hold on ARIKAYCE announced in late 2011, we recorded a charge of $26.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 that reduced the value of IPRD to $58.2 million and reduced goodwill to zero. Other potential future activities or results could result in additional write-downs of IPRD, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to use our net operating losses.\nWe have substantial tax loss carry forwards for US federal income tax and state income tax purposes and beginning in 2015, we have tax loss carry forwards in Ireland as well. Our ability to fully use certain US tax loss carry forwards prior to December 2010 to offset future income or tax liability is limited under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Changes in the ownership of our stock, including those resulting from the issuance of shares of our common stock upon exercise of outstanding options, may limit or eliminate our ability to use certain net operating losses in the future.\nAny acquisitions we make, or collaborative relationships we enter into, may require a significant amount of our available cash and may not be scientifically or commercially successful.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may effect acquisitions to obtain additional businesses, products, technologies, capabilities and personnel, but we cannot assure you that we will identify suitable products or enter into such acquisitions on acceptable terms.\nAcquisitions involve a number of operational risks, including:\n\u00b7 Failure to achieve expected synergies; \u00b7 Difficulty and expense of assimilating the operations, technology and personnel of the acquired business; \u00b7 Our inability to retain the management, key personnel and other employees of the acquired business; \u00b7 Our inability to maintain the acquired company's relationship with key third parties, such as alliance partners; \u00b7 Exposure to legal claims for activities of the acquired business prior to the acquisition; \u00b7 The diversion of our management's attention from our core business; and \u00b7 The potential impairment of goodwill and write-off of in-process research and development costs, adversely affecting our reported results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also may enter into collaborative relationships that would involve our collaborators conducting proprietary development programs. Any conflict with our collaborators could limit our ability to obtain future collaboration agreements and negatively influence our relationship with existing collaborators. Disagreements with collaborators may also develop over the rights to our intellectual property.\nIf we make one or more significant acquisitions or enter into a significant collaboration in which the consideration includes cash, we may be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash and/or need to raise additional capital. For instance, in September and October of 2016, we borrowed $30.0 million under the A&R Loan Agreement to fund the payment due under the AZ License Agreement, and this investment-as with any acquisition or collaboration-may not be successful.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nThere is little or no precedent for clinical development and regulatory expectations for agents to treat NTM; as a result, we may encounter challenges developing clinical endpoints that will ultimately be satisfactory to regulators, which could delay commercialization of our product candidates or subject us to the risk of having any approval withdrawn.\nThe FDA may base accelerated approval for drugs for serious conditions that fill an unmet medical need on whether the drug has an effect on a surrogate or an intermediate clinical endpoint (other than survival or irreversible morbidity). We are using a surrogate endpoint in our CONVERT study. Developing clinical endpoints that are unsatisfactory to regulators could delay clinical trials and the FDA approval process which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, the value of our common stock and our prospects.\nIf one or more of our product candidates is approved based on a surrogate or an intermediate clinical endpoint under the accelerated approval regulations, the approval will be subject to the requirement that we study the product candidate further to verify and describe its clinical benefit,\nwhere there is uncertainty as to the relation of the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint to clinical benefit or of the observed clinical benefit to the ultimate outcome. Thus, even if we are successful in obtaining accelerated approval in the US or under comparable pathways in other jurisdictions, we may face requirements and limitations that will adversely affect our prospects. For example, we may not successfully complete required post-approval trials, or such trials may not confirm the clinical benefit of our drug, and we may be required to withdraw approval of the drug.\nFor ARIKAYCE to be successfully developed and commercialized in a given market, in addition to regulatory approvals required for ARIKAYCE, the eFlow nebulizer system must satisfy certain regulatory requirements and its use as a delivery system for ARIKAYCE must be approved for use by regulators.\nThe eFlow Nebulizer System must receive regulatory approval in order for us to develop and commercialize ARIKAYCE. Although the optimized eFlow Nebulizer System is CE marked by PARI the EU, outside the EU, it is labeled as investigational for use in our clinical trials in the US, Japan, Canada and Australia. The optimized eFlow Nebulizer System is not approved for commercial use in the US, Canada or certain other markets in which we may choose to commercialize ARIKAYCE if approved. We continue to work closely with PARI to coordinate efforts regarding regulatory requirements, including our proposed filings for a drug and device. However, we or PARI may not be successful in meeting the regulatory requirements for the eFlow Nebulizer System, which would prevent or hinder our ability to bring ARIKAYCE to market or market it successfully.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for ARIKAYCE or any of our other product candidates, we will continue to face extensive regulatory requirements and our products may face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven if marketing approval in the US is obtained, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a product's indicated uses or marketing, including risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS), or may impose ongoing requirements on us, including with respect to:\n\u00b7 Labeling, such as black box or other warnings or contraindications; \u00b7 Post-market surveillance, post-market studies or post-market clinical trials; \u00b7 Packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information; \u00b7 Monitoring and reporting adverse events and instances of the failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA; \u00b7 Compliance with cGMPs; \u00b7 Changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process; \u00b7 Advertising and other promotional material; and \u00b7 Disclosure of clinical trial results on publicly available databases.\nIn addition, the distribution, sale and marketing of our products are subject to a number of additional requirements, including:\n\u00b7 State wholesale drug distribution laws and the distribution of our product samples to physicians must comply with the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA); \u00b7 Sales, marketing and scientific or educational grant programs must comply with federal and state laws; and \u00b7 Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements, and if products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply.\nAll of these activities also may be subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u00b7 Issue warning letters or untitled letters asserting that we are in violation of the law; \u00b7 Seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines; \u00b7 Suspend or withdraw marketing approval; \u00b7 Suspend any ongoing clinical trials; \u00b7 Refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications submitted by us; \u00b7 Suspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; \u00b7 Seize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall; \u00b7 Refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts; and/or \u00b7 Impose civil monetary penalties or pursue civil or criminal prosecutions and fines against our company or responsible officers.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response, and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenues.\nThe manufacturing facilities of our third party manufacturers are subject to significant government regulations and approvals, which are often costly and could result in adverse consequences to our business if we and our manufacturing partner fail to comply with the regulations or maintain the approvals.\nManufacturers of our product candidates are subject to cGMP and similar standards, and we do not have control over compliance with these regulations by our manufacturers. If one of them fails to obtain or maintain compliance or experiences problems in the scale-up of commercial production, the production of our product candidates could be interrupted, resulting in delays, additional costs or restrictions on the marketing or sale of our products. In addition, these manufacturers and their facilities will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities following regulatory approval, if any, of our product candidates. For instance, to monitor compliance with applicable regulations, the FDA routinely conducts inspections of facilities and may identify potential deficiencies. For example, the FDA issues what are referred to as \"FDA Form 483s\" that set forth observations and concerns that are identified during its inspections. Failure to satisfactorily address the concerns or potential deficiencies identified in a Form 483 could result in the issuance of a warning letter, which is a notice of the issues that the FDA believes to be significant regulatory violations requiring prompt corrective actions. Failure to respond adequately to a warning letter, or to otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement, remedial and/or punitive actions by the FDA or other regulatory authorities.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for ARIKAYCE or any of our other product candidates, adverse effects discovered after approval could limit the commercial profile of any approved product.\nIf we obtain marketing approval for ARIKAYCE or any other product candidate that we develop, such products will be used by a larger number of patients and for longer periods of time than\nthey were used in clinical trials. This discovery could have a number of potentially significant negative consequences, including:\n\u00b7 Regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product and may require recall of product in distribution; \u00b7 Regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as black box or other warnings or contraindications, or the issuance of \"Dear Doctor Letters\" or similar communications to healthcare professionals; \u00b7 Regulatory authorities may impose additional restrictions on marketing and distribution of the products, or other risk management measures, such as a REMS; \u00b7 We may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical studies or restrict the distribution of the product; \u00b7 We could be sued and held liable for harm caused to subjects; and \u00b7 We could be subject to negative publicity, including communications issued by regulatory authorities.\nAny of these events could prevent us from maintaining market acceptance of the affected product, cause substantial reduction in sales or substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates, cause significant financial losses or result in significant reputational damage.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from governments or third-party payers for ARIKAYCE or any other products that we may develop or if we are unable to obtain acceptable prices for those products, our prospects for generating revenue and achieving profitability may be materially adversely affected.\nOur prospects for generating revenue and achieving profitability depend heavily upon the availability of adequate reimbursement for the use of our approved product candidates from governmental and other third-party payers, both in the US and in other markets. Reimbursement by a third party payer may depend upon a number of factors, including the third party payer's determination that use of a product is:\n\u00b7 A covered benefit under its health plan; \u00b7 Safe, effective and medically necessary; \u00b7 Appropriate for the specific patient; \u00b7 Cost-effective; and \u00b7 Neither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining reimbursement approval for a product from each government or other third-party payer is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of our products to each payer. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to reimbursement or we might need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any future products to such payers' satisfaction. Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources. Even when a payer determines that a product is eligible for reimbursement, the payer may impose coverage limitations that preclude payment for some uses that are approved by the FDA or non-US regulatory authorities. In addition, there is a risk that full reimbursement may not be available for high priced products. Moreover, eligibility for coverage does not imply that any product will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that allows us to make a profit or even cover our costs. Interim payments for new products, if applicable, also may not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Subsequent approvals of competitive products could result in a detrimental change to the reimbursement of our products.\nThere is a significant focus in the US healthcare industry and elsewhere on cost containment and value. We expect changes in the Medicare program and state Medicaid programs, as well as managed care organizations and other third-party payers, to continue to put pressure on pharmaceutical product pricing in return for near-term cost effectiveness or budget impact. For instance, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) expanded Medicare outpatient prescription drug coverage for the elderly through Part D prescription drug plans sponsored by private entities and authorized such plans to use formularies where they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. The plans generally negotiate significant price concessions as a condition of formulary placement. The MMA also introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs, which is generally believed to have resulted in lower Medicare reimbursement for physician-administered drugs. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation provide additional pressure to contain and reduce drug prices and could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business. Although the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations when setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reimbursement reduction resulting from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) revised the definition of \"average manufacturer price\" for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states, and has imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. We believe it is likely that the ACA, or any legislation enacted to replace it, will continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and also may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. If one or more of our product candidates reaches commercialization, such changes may have a significant impact on our ability to set a price we believe is fair for our products and may adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability. We expect further federal and state proposals and health care reforms to continue to be proposed by legislators and/or the newly elected US President, which could limit the prices that can be charged for the products we develop and may limit our commercial opportunity.\nMoreover, in markets outside the US, including Japan, Canada and the countries in the EU, pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control. Evaluation criteria used by many EU government agencies for the purposes of pricing and reimbursement typically focus on a product's degree of innovation and its ability to meet a clinical need unfulfilled by currently available therapies. The ACA created a similar entity, the Patient- Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) designed to review the effectiveness of treatments and medications in federally-funded health care programs. The PCORI began its first research initiatives recently, and an adverse result may result in a treatment or product being removed from Medicare or Medicare coverage. The decisions of such governmental agencies could affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nGovernment health care reform could increase our costs, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, the value of our common stock and our prospects.\nOur industry is highly regulated and changes in or revisions to laws and regulations that make gaining regulatory approval, reimbursement and pricing more difficult or subject to different criteria and standards may adversely impact our business, operations or financial results. For example, under the ACA, drug manufacturers are required to report information on payments or transfers of value to US physicians and teaching hospitals as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. The reported data is posted in searchable form on a public website. In addition, some states, as well as other countries, including France, require the disclosure of certain payments to health care\nprofessionals. In the coming years, we expect additional and potentially substantial, changes to governmental programs that could significantly impact the success of our product candidates.\nThe new Administration and the majority party in both Houses of Congress have indicated their desire to repeal the ACA. It is unclear whether, when and how that repeal will be effectuated and what the effect on the healthcare sector will be. The new US President has indicated an interest in having the federal government negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Changes to the ACA, to the Medicare or Medicaid programs, or to the ability of the federal government to negotiate drug prices, or other federal legislation regarding healthcare access, financing or legislation in individual states, could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, the value of our common stock and our prospects.\nWe will need approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside the US for our proposed trade names. Any failure or delay associated with such approvals may delay the commercialization of our products.\nAny trade name we intend to use for our product candidates will require approval from the FDA regardless of whether we have secured a formal trademark registration from the US Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO. The FDA typically conducts a rigorous review of proposed trade names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other trade names and medication error. The FDA also may object to a trade name if it believes the name is inappropriately promotional. Even after the FDA approves a trade name, the FDA may request that we adopt an alternative name for the product if adverse event reports indicate a potential for confusion with other trade names and medication error. If we are required to adopt an alternative name, the commercialization of ARIKAYCE could be delayed or interrupted, which would limit our ability to commercialize ARIKAYCE and generate revenues.\nIf we are found in violation of federal or state \"fraud and abuse\" laws, we may be required to pay a penalty or may be suspended from participation in federal or state health care programs, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the US, we are subject to various federal and state health care \"fraud and abuse\" laws, including anti-kickback laws, false claims laws and other laws intended to reduce fraud and abuse in federal and state health care programs. Although we seek to structure our business arrangements in compliance with all applicable requirements, these laws are broadly written, and it is often difficult to determine precisely how the law will be applied in specific circumstances. Accordingly, it is possible that our practices may be challenged under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines or exclusion or suspension from federal and state health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and debarment from contracting with the US government, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected. Our reputation could also suffer. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the government under the federal FCA as well as under the false claims laws of several states.\nSeveral states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state. Health record privacy laws may limit access to information identifying those individuals who may be prospective users or prohibit contact with any persons enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements, and we could be subject to penalties if a state determines that we have failed to comply with an applicable state law requirement.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, the value of our product candidates could be diminished.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal, technical, scientific and factual questions, and our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and to obtain patent protection for our products, prevent third parties from infringing on our patents, both domestically and internationally. We have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the US and abroad related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business. This process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our technologies or from developing competing products and technologies.\nEven if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Any conclusions we may reach regarding non-infringement, inapplicability or invalidity of a third party's intellectual property vis-\u00e0-vis our proprietary rights, or those of a licensor, are based in significant part on a review of publicly available databases and other information. There may be information not available to us or otherwise not reviewed by us that could render these conclusions inaccurate. Our competitors may also be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\nAdditionally, patents issued to us or our licensors may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated, held to be unenforceable or circumvented through litigation, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or reduce the term of patent protection we may have for our products. US patents and patent applications may also be subject to interference or derivation proceedings, and US patents may be subject to re-examination proceedings, reissue, post-grant review and/or inter partes review in the USPTO. Foreign patents may be subject to opposition or comparable proceedings in the corresponding foreign patent office, which could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. See Intellectual Property-ARIKAYCE Patents and Trade Secrets for information on our European Patent that is being opposed by Generics (UK) Ltd.\nChanges in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the US and other countries may also diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection, including making it easier for competitors to challenge our patents. For example, the America Invents Act included a number of changes to established practices, including the transition to a first-inventor-to-file system and new procedures for challenging patents and implementation of different methods for invalidating patents.\nIf we are not able to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information, the value of our product candidates could be significantly diminished.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technologies, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors, collaborators,\nand other third parties and partners to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information or may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, third parties may independently develop or discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. For example, the FDA, as part of its Transparency Initiative continues to consider whether to make additional information publicly available on a routine basis, including information that we may consider to be trade secrets or other proprietary information, and it is not clear at the present time whether and how the FDA's disclosure policies may change in the future.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the US. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to life sciences. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or in-licensed patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be required to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the US and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and to enforce intellectual property rights.\nWe may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may prevent or delay our product development efforts, prevent us from commercializing our products or increase the costs of commercializing our products.\nThird parties may claim that we have infringed upon or misappropriated their proprietary rights. Any existing third-party patents, or patents that may later issue to third parties, could negatively affect our commercialization of ARIKAYCE, INS1007, INS1009 or any other product. For instance, PAH is a competitive indication with established products, including other formulations of treprostinil. Our supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for INS1009 is dependent upon a single supplier. The supplier owns patents on its manufacturing process, and we have filed patent applications for INS1009; however, a competitor in the PAH indication may claim that we or our supplier have infringed upon or misappropriated its proprietary rights. In the event of a successful claim against us for infringement or misappropriation of a third party's proprietary rights, we may be required to take actions including but not limited to the following:\n\u00b7 Pay damages, including up to treble damages, and the other party's attorneys' fees, which may be substantial; \u00b7 Cease the development, manufacture, marketing and sale of products or use of processes that infringe the proprietary rights of others; \u00b7 Expend significant resources to redesign our products or our processes so that they do not infringe the proprietary rights of others, which may not be possible; \u00b7 Redesign our products or processes to avoid third-party proprietary rights, which means we may suffer significant regulatory delays associated with conducting additional clinical trials or other steps to obtain regulatory approval; and/or\n\u00b7 Obtain one or more licenses arising out of a settlement of litigation or otherwise from third parties which license(s) may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nSuch litigation, and any resulting resolution, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, the value of our common stock and our prospects.\nAny lawsuits or other proceedings relating to infringement by us or third parties of intellectual property rights may be costly and time consuming.\nWe may have to undertake costly litigation or engage in other proceedings, such as interference or inter partes review, to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us, to confirm the scope and validity of our or a licensor's proprietary rights or to defend against allegations that we have infringed a third party's intellectual property rights. Such proceedings are also likely to be time consuming and may divert management attention from operation of our business.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license rights to technology from third parties, or if the license agreements are terminated for other reasons, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to licensing agreements with PARI and AZ, which we view as material to our business. For additional information regarding the terms of these agreements, see Business-License and Other Agreements. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, our counterparty may have the right to take action against us, up to and including termination of the relevant license. For instance, under our licensing agreement with PARI, with respect to NTM, CF and bronchiectasis, we have specific obligations to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve certain developmental and regulatory milestones by set deadlines. Additionally, for NTM, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve certain commercial milestones in the US, Europe and Canada. The consequences of our failing to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve certain commercial milestones are context-specific, but include ending PARI's non-compete obligation, making the license non-exclusive and terminating the license, in each case with respect to the applicable indication. Similarly, under the AZ License Agreement, AstraZeneca may terminate our license to INS1007 if we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a product based on INS1007, or we are subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency. Reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms and may materially harm our business.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe operate in a highly competitive and changing environment, and if we are unable to adapt to our environment, we may be unable to compete successfully.\nBiotechnology and related pharmaceutical technology have undergone and are likely to continue to experience rapid and significant change. We expect that the technologies associated with biotechnology research and development will continue to develop rapidly. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies and to obtain and maintain protection for our intellectual property. Any compounds, products or processes that we develop may become obsolete before we recover any expenses incurred in connection with their development. In each of our potential product areas, we face substantial competition from pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other companies, universities and research institutions. Relative to us, most of these entities have substantially greater capital resources, research and development staffs, facilities and experience in conducting clinical studies and obtaining regulatory approvals, as well as in\nmanufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. Many of our competitors may achieve product commercialization or patent protection earlier than us. Furthermore, we believe that our competitors have used, and may continue to use, litigation to gain a competitive advantage. Our competitors may also use different technologies or approaches to the development of products similar to the products we are seeking to develop.\nWe expect that successful competition will depend, among other things, on product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, timing and scope of regulatory approval and price. Specifically, we expect crucial factors will include the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete the clinical testing and regulatory approval processes and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market. We expect competition to increase as technological advances are made and commercial applications broaden. For instance, there are potential competitive products, both approved and in development, which include oral, systemic, or inhaled antibiotic products to treat chronic respiratory infections. If any of our competitors develops a product that is more effective, safer, tolerable or, convenient or less expensive than ARIKAYCE or our other product candidates, it would likely materially adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. We also may face lower priced generic competitors if third-party payers encourage use of generic or lower-priced versions of our product or if competing products are imported into the US or other countries where we may sell ARIKAYCE.\nIn the event there are other amikacin products approved by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for any use, physicians may elect to prescribe those products rather than ARIKAYCE to treat the indications for which ARIKAYCE may receive approval, which is commonly referred to as off-label use. Although regulations prohibit a drug company from promoting off-label use of its product, the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate the practice of medicine and cannot direct physicians as to what product to prescribe to their patients. As a result, we would have limited ability to prevent any off-label use of a competitor's product to treat diseases for which we have received FDA or other regulatory agency approval, even if such use violates our patents or orphan drug exclusivity for the use of amikacin to treat such diseases. If we are unable to compete successfully, it will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, the value of our common stock and our prospects.\nIf another party obtains orphan drug exclusivity for a product that is essentially the same as a product we are developing for a particular indication, we may be precluded or delayed from commercializing the product in that indication.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition. The company that obtains the first marketing approval from the FDA for a designated orphan drug for a rare disease receives marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the designated condition for a period of seven years. Similar laws exist in EU with a term of ten years. See Business-Government Regulation-Orphan Drugs for additional information. If a competitor obtains approval of the same drug for the same indication or disease before us, we would be prohibited from obtaining approval for our product for seven or more years, unless our product can be shown to be clinically superior.\nIf we obtain orphan exclusivity for a product, the FDA may approve another product during our orphan exclusivity period for the same indication under certain circumstances.\nThe Orphan Drug Act was created to encourage companies to develop therapies for rare diseases by providing incentives for drug development and commercialization. One of the incentives provided by the act is seven years of market exclusivity in the US for the first product in a class licensed for the treatment of a rare disease. Orphan exclusivity does not, however, bar approval of\nanother product under certain circumstances. One such circumstance is if a product with the same active ingredient is proven safe and effective for a different indication. Another circumstance is if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care. The FDA may also approve another product with the same active ingredient and the same indication if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. As a result, even if one of our product candidates receives orphan exclusivity, the FDA can still approve other drugs that have a different active ingredient for use in treating the same indication or disease. All of the above circumstances could create a more competitive market for us and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur research, development and manufacturing activities used in the production of ARIKAYCE involve the use of hazardous materials, which could expose us to damages, fines, penalties and sanctions and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our research and development program and manufacturing activities for ARIKAYCE and our other product candidates involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. Although we strive to comply with all pertinent regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of environmental contamination, damage to facilities or injury to personnel from the accidental or improper use or control of these materials. In addition to any liability we could have for any misuse by us of hazardous materials and chemicals, we could also potentially be liable for activities of our CMOs or other third parties. Any such liability, or even allegations of such liability, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims, and we have only limited product liability insurance.\nThe manufacture and sale of human therapeutic products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims, which can lead to significant adverse publicity and obligations to pay damages. We currently have only limited product liability insurance for our products. We do not know if we will be able to maintain existing, or obtain additional, product liability insurance on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities. This type of insurance is expensive and may not be available on acceptable terms. If we are unable to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we may be unable to commercialize our products. A successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage, if any, may require us to pay substantial amounts and may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nWe are dependent upon retaining and attracting key personnel, the loss of whose services could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe depend highly on the principal members of our scientific and management personnel, the loss of whose services might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our research, development or business objectives. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified management, scientific and medical personnel, and on our ability to develop and maintain important relationships with commercial partners, leading research institutions and key distributors. We will need to hire additional personnel in anticipation of seeking regulatory approval for and commercial launch of ARIKAYCE.\nCompetition for skilled personnel in our industry and market is very intense because of the numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that seek similar personnel. These companies may have greater financial and other resources, offer a greater opportunity for career advancement and have a longer history in the industry than we do. We also experience competition for the hiring of our scientific and clinical personnel from universities, research institutions, and other third parties. We cannot assure that we will attract and retain such persons or maintain such relationships. Our inability to retain and attract qualified employees would materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, the value of our common stock and our prospects.\nWe expect to expand our development, manufacturing, regulatory and future sales and marketing capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe expect that our potential expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise, such as further clinical trials, governmental approvals, manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution will place additional requirements on our management, operational and financial resources. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees.\nThe anticipated commercialization of ARIKAYCE and the development of additional product candidates will require significant expenditures by us and place a strain on our resources. If our management is unable to effectively manage our activities in anticipation of commercialization, as well as our development efforts, we may incur higher than expected expenditures or other expenses and our business may otherwise be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock and Listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market\nThe market price of our stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol INSM. The market price of our stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile, and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, including those discussed herein, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have particularly affected the market prices for emerging biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies like us, and which have often been unrelated to their\noperating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Historically, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, shareholders are more likely to institute securities and derivative class action litigation against the issuer of such stock. As described below, a securities class action lawsuit was initiated against us during 2016 following a decline in our stock price.\nWe and certain of our officers and directors are subject to a securities class action lawsuit, which may require significant management and board time and attention and significant legal expenses and may result in an unfavorable outcome, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe and certain of our executive officers and directors have been named as defendants in a securities class action lawsuit initially filed on July 15, 2016. The amended complaint, filed December 15, 2016, alleges that we and certain of our executive officers and directors violated Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), and that we and certain of our executive officers violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder of the Exchange Act, by making materially false or misleading statements and omissions relating to the development of ARIKAYCE and/or related requests for regulatory approval. It also alleges that the defendant officers and directors violated Section 15 of the Securities Act and that the defendant officers violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. For additional information, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings. While we believe that we have substantial legal and factual defenses to the claims in the class action and intend to vigorously defend the case, this lawsuit could divert our management's and board's attention from other business matters, the outcome of the pending litigation is difficult to predict and quantify, and the defense against the underlying claims will likely be costly. The ultimate resolution of this matter could result in payments of monetary damages or other costs, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, or adversely affect our reputation, and consequently, could negatively impact the price of our common stock.\nWe have insurance policies related to the risks associated with our business, including directors' and officers' liability insurance policies. However, there is no assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient or that our insurance carriers will cover all claims in that litigation. If we are not successful in our defense of the claims asserted in the putative action and those claims are not covered by insurance or exceed our insurance coverage, we may have to pay damage awards, indemnify our officers from damage awards that may be entered against them and pay the costs and expenses incurred in defense of, or in any settlement of, such claims.\nIn addition, there is the potential for additional shareholder litigation against us, and we could be materially and adversely affected by such matters.\nFuture issuances of our common stock will dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders and such issuances, or the possibility of such issuances, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock or our future ability to raise capital through an offering of equity securities.\nOur Articles of Incorporation currently authorize us to issue up to 500 million common shares. As of December 31, 2016, we had 62.0 million shares of common stock outstanding. To the extent that we issue additional common stock in connection with any offerings of securities, strategic transactions, or otherwise, such funding may significantly dilute existing shareholders. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, 7.2 million shares of our common stock are potentially issuable under outstanding restricted stock units and stock options to our employees, officers, directors and consultants. The conversion or exercise of some or all of our restricted stock units and options will similarly dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders. In addition, sales in the public market of newly issued, or\neven the possibility of such sales, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock or our future ability to raise capital through an equity offering.\nCertain provisions of Virginia law and our articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could hamper a third party's acquisition of, or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us.\nCertain provisions of Virginia law and our articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could hamper a third party's acquisition of, or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 The ability to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without any further vote or action by the holders of the common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of the common stock. In certain circumstances, such issuance could have the effect of decreasing the market price of the common stock; \u00b7 The existence of a staggered board of directors in which there are three classes of directors serving staggered three-year terms, thus expanding the time required to change the composition of a majority of directors and perhaps discouraging someone from making an acquisition proposal for us; \u00b7 The requirement that shareholders provide advance notice when nominating director candidates to serve on our Board of Directors; \u00b7 The inability of shareholders to convene a shareholders' meeting without the chairman of the board, the president or a majority of the board of directors first calling the meeting; and \u00b7 The prohibition against entering into a business combination with the beneficial owner of 10% or more of our outstanding voting stock for a period of three years after the 10% or greater owner first reached that level of stock ownership, unless we meet certain criteria.\nIn addition, we previously had a \"poison pill\" shareholder rights plan, which expired in May 2011. Under Virginia law, our Board of Directors may implement a new shareholders' rights plan without shareholder approval. Our Board of Directors intends to regularly consider this matter, even in the absence of specific circumstances or takeover proposals, to facilitate its future ability to quickly and effectively protect shareholder value.\nOther Risks Related to our Business\nCorporate governance and public disclosure requirements increase our costs of compliance, and our inability to satisfy these requirements could materially harm our business.\nLaws, regulations and standards relating to accounting, corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, other SEC regulations, and the Nasdaq Global Select Market rules have high costs of compliance, and our failure to comply with such laws, regulations and standards may be detrimental to our business. In particular, our efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors' audit of our internal control over financial reporting requires the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. The inability of management and our independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, a loss of investor confidence in the reliability\nof our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline, and substantial costs and resources to rectify any internal control deficiencies. For example, in connection with our review of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, we determined that we did not adequately implement certain controls over the administration, accounting and oversight of our 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, and we concluded that a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting existed as of December 31, 2012. Any material weaknesses may materially adversely affect our ability to report accurately our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and reliable manner. In addition, although we continually review and evaluate internal control systems to allow management to report on the sufficiency of our internal controls, we cannot assure you that we will not discover weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, and our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards in this regard have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. In addition, our board members, chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with their performance of duties. As a result, we may face difficulties attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers, which could materially harm our business.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our business operations, including our drug development programs.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material adverse effect on our business operations, including a material disruption of our drug development programs. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data, whether through breach of computer systems, systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or otherwise, could damage our reputation. Similarly, unauthorized access to or through our information systems and networks, whether by our employees or third parties, could result in negative publicity, legal liability and damage to our reputation. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for any of our drug candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our drug candidates could be delayed.\nAlthough we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, our insurance may not cover all claims, continue to be available on reasonable terms or be sufficient in amount to cover one or more large claims; additionally, the insurer may disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed or are not covered by our insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws and trade control laws, as well as other laws governing our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to negative publicity, civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common stock.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business. The FCPA, UK Bribery Act and these other laws generally prohibit us, our employees and our intermediaries from making prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. We are conducting the CONVERT study at more than 125 sites in 18 countries around the world, and certain of these jurisdictions in which we operate pose a risk of potential FCPA violations, and we participate in joint ventures and relationships with third parties whose actions could potentially subject us to liability under the FCPA or local anti-corruption laws. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nWe are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security, the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control, and various non-US government entities, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, customs requirements, currency exchange regulations and transfer pricing regulations (collectively, Trade Control laws).\nWe may not be effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anticorruption laws, including the FCPA or other legal requirements, including Trade Control laws. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and the price of our common stock. Likewise, even an investigation by US or foreign authorities of potential violations of the FCPA other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 88351, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "INSM"}
