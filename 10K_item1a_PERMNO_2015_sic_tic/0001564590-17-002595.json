RISK FACTORS.\nAny of the risks described below could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. These risks are not the only risks facing Essendant; the Company\u2019s business operations could also be materially adversely affected by risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to Essendant or that Essendant currently deems immaterial.\nThe loss of one or more significant customers could significantly reduce Essendant\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nIn 2016, Essendant\u2019s largest customer accounted for approximately 11% of net sales and Essendant\u2019s five largest customers accounted for approximately 25% of net sales. Several of Essendant\u2019s current and potential customers were involved in business combinations in 2016 and 2015 and the Company expects increased customer consolidation in the future. Following business combinations, the surviving companies often review their supply chain and sourcing options, which can result in the companies altering their sourcing relationships. The Company generally does not have long-term contracts with its customers, which are typically free to reduce or terminate their purchases from the Company on little or no notice. Increasing direct purchases by major customers from manufacturers, as well as the loss of one or more key customers, changes in the sales mix or sales volume to key customers, or a significant downturn in the business or financial condition of any of them could significantly reduce Essendant\u2019s sales and profitability.\nPrice transparency, customer consolidation, and changes in product sales mix may result in lower margins.\nThe Company faces price and margin pressure due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nIncreased price transparency, driven by online resellers;\n\u2022\nCustomer consolidation resulting in some customers increasing their buying power and seeking economic concessions from the Company;\n\u2022\nShift in customer mix from higher to lower margin channels and vertical markets;\n\u2022\nShift in category mix to a larger share of lower margin categories;\n\u2022\nSecular decline in office products categories leading to unfavorable product mix; and\n\u2022\nSupplier consolidation.\nIf Essendant is unable to reduce expenses, grow sales to existing and new customers, and increase sales of higher margin products as a percentage of total sales, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nFor example, during 2016, despite the Company\u2019s success at converting customers, profitability was adversely affected by margin pressure resulting from a shift in customer mix to lower margin customers and in product category mix to lower margin products. The transparency of pricing online also caused margin pressure.\nEssendant relies on independent resellers for a significant percentage of its net sales.\nSales to independent resellers account for a significant portion of Essendant\u2019s net sales. Independent resellers compete with national distributors and retailers that have substantially greater financial resources and technical and marketing capabilities. Financial, technical, and commercial constraints are challenging as business increasingly shifts online. Over the years, several of the Company\u2019s independent reseller customers have been acquired by competitors or have ceased operation, and the Company expects independent reseller customers to continue to consolidate. If Essendant\u2019s customer base of independent resellers declines and the Company is not able to replace resulting sales declines, the Company\u2019s business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nEssendant\u2019s reliance on supplier allowances and promotional incentives could impact profitability.\nSupplier allowances and promotional incentives that are often based on the volume of Company product purchases contribute significantly to Essendant\u2019s profitability. If Essendant does not comply with suppliers\u2019 terms and conditions, or does not make requisite purchases to achieve certain volume hurdles, Essendant may not earn certain allowances and promotional incentives. For example, in 2016, as the Company executed its strategy to improve cash flow in part through lower inventory balances, a reduction in purchases from suppliers resulted in lower supplier allowances and promotional incentives, which contributed to unfavorable gross margin changes. Additionally, suppliers may reduce the allowances they pay Essendant if they conclude the value Essendant creates does not justify the allowances. If Essendant\u2019s suppliers reduce or otherwise alter their allowances or promotional incentives, Essendant\u2019s profit margin for the sale of the products it purchases from those suppliers may decline. The loss or diminution of supplier allowances and promotional support could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. As part of the Company\u2019s multi-year transformation program, the Company has undertaken merchandising and sourcing initiatives to more effectively leverage supply relationships and enhance profitability. Failure to complete the process, incomplete attainment or ineffective management of the initiatives could cause declines in profitability and results of operations.\nEssendant is exposed to the credit risk of its customers.\nEssendant extends credit to its customers. The failure of a significant customer or a significant group of customers to timely pay all amounts due Essendant could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. The Company\u2019s trade receivables are generally unsecured or subordinated to other lenders, and many of the Company\u2019s customers are highly leveraged. The extension of credit involves considerable judgment and is based on management\u2019s evaluation of a variety of factors, including customers\u2019 financial condition and payment history, the availability of collateral to secure customers\u2019 receivables, and customers\u2019 prospects for maintaining or increasing their sales revenues. There can be no assurance that Essendant has assessed and will continue to assess the creditworthiness of its existing or future customers accurately.\nFor example, as of December 31, 2016, the Company recognized a $13.3 million allowance on prepaid rebates and receivables from one customer. This customer has timely paid all amounts due to Essendant; however, the collectability of the receivables over the long-term is in doubt. As of February 21, 2017, the Company had further exposure to this customer related to 2017 activity totaling approximately $18.0 million.\nEssendant operates in a changing competitive environment.\nThe Company operates in a competitive and changing environment. Historically, the Company has competed with other wholesale distributors, manufacturers of the products the Company sells, warehouse clubs, the business-to-business sales divisions of national business products resellers. The Company is also increasingly competing with internet retailers that are selling to resellers, putting price and margin pressures on the Company. If the Company is unable to compete effectively with internet retailers and others in a changing market, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nSupply chain disruptions or changes in key suppliers\u2019 distribution strategies could decrease Essendant\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nEssendant believes its ability to offer a combination of well-known brand name products, competitively priced Essendant brand products, and support services is an important factor in attracting and retaining customers. The Company\u2019s ability to offer a wide range of products and services is dependent on obtaining adequate product supply and services from manufacturers or other suppliers. Essendant\u2019s agreements with its suppliers are generally terminable by either party on limited notice. The loss of, or a substantial decrease in the availability of products or services from key suppliers (in particular a large supplier, for example, the Hewlett Packard Company which represents approximately 20% of the Company\u2019s total purchases in 2016) at competitive prices could cause the Company\u2019s revenues and profitability to decrease. In addition, supply interruptions could arise due to transportation disruptions, labor disputes or other factors beyond Essendant\u2019s control. Disruptions in Essendant\u2019s supply chain could result in a decrease in revenues and profitability.\nSome manufacturers refuse to sell their products to wholesalers like Essendant. Other manufacturers only allow Essendant to sell their products to specified customers. If changes in key suppliers\u2019 distribution strategies or practices reduce the breadth of products the Company is able to purchase or the number of customers to whom Essendant can sell products, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nMany of the Company\u2019s independent resellers use third party technology vendors (\u201c3PVs\u201d) to automate their business operations. The 3PVs play an important role in the independent dealer channel, as most purchase orders, order confirmations, stock availability checks, invoices, and advanced shipping notices are exchanged between Essendant and its independent resellers over 3PV networks. The 3PVs also provide e-commerce portals that Essendant\u2019s customers use to transact online business with their customers. If Essendant is unable to transact business with its customers through one or more 3PVs on terms that are acceptable to Essendant, or if a 3PV fails to provide quality services to Essendant\u2019s customers, Essendant\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nDemand for office products is expected to continue to decline.\nThe overall demand for certain office products has weakened and is expected to continue to decline as consumers increasingly create, share, and store documents electronically, without printing or filing them. Furthermore, many of the products that have experienced increased demand in recent years have lower margins than the products for which demand has declined. If demand continues to decline and Essendant is unable to offset lower aggregate demand by increasing market share for these products, finding new markets for these products, increasing sales of products in other product categories, and reducing expenses, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nEssendant may experience financial cycles related to broad economic factors due to secular consumer demand, recession or other events.\nSales of Essendant\u2019s products have been affected by secular market pressures and are subject to cyclical fluctuations of material economic factors. Cyclical effects have been particularly notable in Industrial and Automotive. For example, in 2015, challenges in the oil and gas industries impacted the Company\u2019s oilfield and welding sectors within its Industrial business, and these industries have not yet fully recovered. Cyclical changes in demand for the products the Company sells have affected and could continue to detrimentally affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEssendant may not be successful in implementing strategic objectives.\nThe Company is undertaking a comprehensive, multi-year transformation program that includes enhancements in merchandising, closer alignment of pricing with the cost to serve, stabilization of the JanSan sales channel, Industrial growth, additional cost reductions and reductions in working capital and debt. If Essendant is unable to efficiently, effectively and timely implement the program, the Company could experience diminished operating results as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s time, attention and resources from managing the Company\u2019s continuing operations, the incurrence of additional costs in connection with the program, disruption to customers and suppliers, or other factors. In addition, the Company\u2019s merchandising efforts may result in changes in the product assortment offered by the Company and changes in or termination of relationships with certain suppliers. Suppliers adversely affected by the Company\u2019s merchandising efforts may increase their direct sales to the Company\u2019s customers or take other actions that adversely affect the Company. In addition, certain of our customers have preferences for products from suppliers whose products may not be part of our future core supply chain and merchandising strategy. If we are not able to, or choose not to, offer products from the suppliers our customers prefer, we may lose customer business, which could adversely impact our results of operation. The Company\u2019s efforts to align pricing with the cost to serve may result in decreased sales to some customers.\nEssendant must manage inventory effectively while minimizing excess and obsolete inventory.\nTo maximize supplier allowances and minimize excess and obsolete inventory, Essendant must project end-consumer demand for approximately 190,000 items. If Essendant underestimates demand for a particular manufacturer\u2019s products, the Company will lose sales, reduce customer satisfaction, and earn a lower level of allowances from that manufacturer. If Essendant overestimates demand, it may have to liquidate excess or obsolete inventory at a price that would produce a lower margin, no margin, or a loss.\nEssendant is focusing on increasing its sales of Essendant brand products. These products can present unique inventory challenges. Essendant sources some of its Essendant brand products overseas, resulting in longer order-lead times than for comparable products sourced domestically. These longer lead-times make it more difficult to forecast demand accurately and require larger inventory investments to support high service levels.\nThe Company relies heavily on the ability to recruit, retain, and develop high-performing managers and the lack of execution in these areas could harm the Company\u2019s ability to carry out its business strategy.\nEssendant\u2019s ability to implement its business strategy depends largely on the efforts, skills, abilities, and judgment of the Company\u2019s executive management team. Essendant\u2019s success also depends to a significant degree on its ability to recruit and retain sales and marketing, operations, and other senior managers. For the last several years, the Company\u2019s incentive compensation plans have paid out substantially below target. Our compensation arrangements, such as our management incentive plans, long-term incentive plans, and other compensatory arrangements, may not be successful in retaining and motivating our existing employees and attracting new employees or the Company may need to take more costly actions to attract and retain the talent needed to lead the Company\u2019s transformation plan.\nThe Company is subject to costs and risks associated with laws, regulations, and industry standards affecting Essendant\u2019s business.\nEssendant is subject to a wide range of state, federal, and foreign laws and industry standards, including laws and standards regarding labor and employment, government contracting, product liability, the storage and transportation of hazardous materials, privacy and data security, imports and exports, tax, and intellectual property, as well as laws relating to the Company\u2019s international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and foreign tax laws. These laws, regulations, and standards may change, sometimes significantly, as a result of political or economic events. The complex legal and regulatory environment exposes Essendant to compliance and litigation costs and risks that could materially affect Essendant\u2019s operations and financial results.\nFor example, the Company has been named as a defendant in two lawsuits alleging that the Company sent unsolicited fax advertisements to certain named plaintiffs, as well as other persons and entities, in violation of various consumer protection acts. Although the Company is vigorously contesting and denies that any violations occurred, the Company\u2019s ultimate liability may be material. See Part II, Item 8, Note 18 - \u201cLegal Matters.\u201d\nA significant disruption or failure of the Company\u2019s information technology systems could disrupt Essendant\u2019s business, result in increased costs and decreased revenues, harm the Company\u2019s reputation, and expose the Company to liability.\nThe Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business, including managing and replenishing inventory, filling and shipping customer orders, and coordinating sales and marketing activities. The Company regularly refreshes, enhances and adds information technology systems and infrastructure, and any such changes create a possibility for disruption or failure of the Company\u2019s existing information technology, which could put the Company at a competitive disadvantage and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. Additionally, further efforts to align portions of its business on common platforms, systems and processes could result in unforeseen interruptions, increased costs, decreased revenues, diminished Company reputation to its customers and suppliers, increased liability and other negative effects.\nA breach of the Company\u2019s information technology systems could result in costly enforcement actions and litigation and could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and relationships.\nThrough Essendant\u2019s sales, marketing, and e-commerce activities, the Company collects and stores personally identifiable information and credit card data that customers provide when they buy products or services, enroll in promotional programs, or otherwise communicate with Essendant. Essendant also gathers and retains information about its employees in the normal course of business. Essendant uses suppliers to assist with certain aspects of Essendant\u2019s business and, to enable the suppliers to perform services for Essendant, the Company shares some of the information provided by customers and employees. Similarly, to enable Essendant to provide goods and services customer information is shared. Essendant has, from time to time, experienced attempts to breach its systems, and these attempts are expected to continue. Any loss, unauthorized access to or misuse of the Company\u2019s information technology systems could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations, expose Essendant to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, and other persons, and damage the Company\u2019s reputation. In addition, compliance with more stringent privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes.\nEssendant\u2019s financial condition and results of operations depend on the availability of financing sources to meet its business needs.\nThe Company depends on various external financing sources to fund its operating, investing, and financing activities. The Company\u2019s maximum revolving borrowings at any time under the 2017 Credit Agreement (defined below) is the lesser of the lenders\u2019 revolving commitments thereunder or the value of the Company\u2019s borrowing base. The borrowing base for the revolving commitments is comprised of a certain percentage of eligible accounts receivables, real estate and equipment, plus a certain percentage of eligible inventory, minus reserves and the borrowing base for the term loan commitments is comprised of a certain percentage of eligible real property and equipment. If borrowing availability under the 2017 Credit Agreement falls below a certain threshold, the Company must comply with certain obligations and restrictions, including additional restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to make acquisitions and investments, dispose of assets, repurchase shares of the Company\u2019s stock, and pay dividends.\nIf the Company violates a covenant or otherwise defaults on its obligations under a financing agreement, the Company\u2019s lenders may refuse to extend additional credit, demand repayment of outstanding indebtedness, terminate the financing agreements, and exercise their rights and remedies including, with respect to the lenders under the 2017 Credit Agreement, their rights as secured creditors. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d included below under Item 7.\nEssendant may not be successful in identifying or consummating future acquisitions.\nHistorically, part of Essendant\u2019s growth and expansion into new product categories or markets has come from targeted acquisitions. Essendant may not be able to identify attractive acquisition candidates or complete the acquisition of any identified candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s acquisitions have included foreign operations, and future acquisitions or other strategic alternatives may increase Essendant\u2019s international presence. International operations present a variety of unique risks, including the costs and difficulties of managing foreign enterprises, limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds, currency fluctuations, cultural differences that affect customer preferences and business practices, and unstable political or economic conditions.\nUnexpected events could disrupt normal business operations, which might result in increased costs and decreased revenues.\nUnexpected events, such as hurricanes, fire, war, terrorism, and other natural or man-made disruptions, may adversely impact Essendant\u2019s ability to serve its customers and increase the cost of doing business or otherwise impact Essendant\u2019s financial performance. In addition, damage to or loss of use of significant aspects of the Company\u2019s infrastructure due to such events could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 79303, "SIC": 5045, "TIC": "ESND"}
