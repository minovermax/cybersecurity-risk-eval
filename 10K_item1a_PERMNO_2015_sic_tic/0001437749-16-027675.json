In addition to the risks set forth below and the other risks described in this annual report, there may also be additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. As a result, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us.\nThe pending Merger and related transactions involving the merger of the Company with and into OceanFirst Financial Corp. and the subsequent merger of Cape Bank with and into OceanFirst Bank are not certain to occur. Failure to comply with terms of the Merger Agreement in the interim prior to closing of the Merger could adversely affect our business. If the Merger and related transactions do not occur, our business, results of operations and our stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nOn January 5, 2016, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (\u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, OceanFirst Financial Corp. (\u201cOceanFirst\u201d), a Delaware corporation and the parent company of OceanFirst Bank, and Justice Merger Sub Corp. (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), a Maryland corporation and the wholly-owned subsidiary of OceanFirst. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving entity, and immediately thereafter the Company will merge with and into OceanFirst, with OceanFirst as the surviving entity (the \u201cMerger\u201d). It is anticipated that immediately after the Merger, Cape Bank will merge with and into OceanFirst Bank, a federal savings bank, with OceanFirst Bank as the surviving bank.\nConsummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including but not limited to: (i) approval of the Merger Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company common stock; (ii) approval of the issuance of OceanFirst common stock in connection with the consummation of the Merger by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast by holders of OceanFirst common stock; (iii) the receipt of all required regulatory approvals and non-objections; and (iii) the non-occurrence of any event that has a \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d on the Company or OceanFirst and their respective subsidiaries. Assuming the satisfaction of such conditions, it is currently expected that the Merger will become effective in the summer of 2016. However, external factors that are beyond the control of the Company, such as the failure by the Company or OceanFirst to obtain stockholder approval, regulatory approval or non-objection, could cause a delay or inability of the Company to consummate the Merger or the other related transactions.\nAs a result of the pending Merger: (i) the attention of management and employees could be diverted from day-to-day operations as they focus on matters relating to the integration of Cape Bank\u2019s operations with those of OceanFirst Bank; (ii) the restrictions and limitations on the conduct of the Company\u2019s business pending the Merger and other related transactions could disrupt or otherwise adversely affect our business and relationships with our customers, and could not be in the best interests of the Company if it were to have to act as an independent entity following a termination of the Merger Agreement; (iii) the Company\u2019s ability to retain its existing employees could be adversely affected due to the uncertainties created by the Merger; and (iv) the Company\u2019s ability to maintain existing customer relationships, or to establish new ones, could be adversely affected. Any delay in consummating the Merger could exacerbate these issues.\nThere can be no assurance that all of the conditions to closing will be satisfied, or where possible, waived, or that the Merger and/or related transactions will become effective. If the Merger and related transactions do not become effective because conditions to closing are not satisfied, or because one or all of the parties terminate the Merger Agreement, the following adverse effects are possible: (i) the Company\u2019s stockholders will not receive the merger consideration described in the Company\u2019s Form 8-K filed January 7, 2016; (ii) the Company\u2019s stock price could decline; (iii) the Company\u2019s business could be adversely affected; (iv) the Company will have incurred significant transaction costs related to negotiating and working towards the Merger; and (v) under certain circumstances, the Company could be obligated to pay OceanFirst a termination fee of $7.2 million. For further information regarding the Merger and the Merger Agreement, see the Company\u2019s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 7, 2016.\nFuture Changes in Interest Rates Could Reduce Our Profits.\nOur ability to make a profit largely depends on our net interest income which could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. Net Interest income is the difference between the interest income earned on our interest-earning assets (such as loans and securities) and the interest expense paid on our interest-bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings).\nShort term interest rates have been maintained at very low levels since the recession by the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (\u201cFOMC\u201d). The FOMC raised rates in the December 2015 meeting and added commentary that future increases may occur during 2016 if economic conditions warrant such changes. Both the timing of any increase and the magnitude of such increase is unknown and adds uncertainty to the bank\u2019s business plan as it relates to key decisions which include the pricing of assets and their projected duration.\nIncreased rates could have a significant impact on the Bank\u2019s net interest income. The section, \u201cNet Interest Income Analysis\u201d relays the negative results of a rate increase illustrated under standard financial models. We evaluate interest rate sensitivity by estimating the change in Cape bank\u2019s net portfolio value over a range of interest rate scenarios. Net portfolio value is the difference of discounted present values of expected cash flows from assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2015, in the event of an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a 4.6% decrease in net portfolio value and a $1.6 million decrease in net interest income. Interest rate decreases during the last year have been the primary cause of the effective duration of the portfolio decreasing from 3.65 years as of December 31, 2014 to 2.80 years as of December 31, 2015. See \u201cItem 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Management of Market Risk.\u201d\nChanges in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. Historically low residential mortgage rates over the recent past may significantly increase the average life of residential mortgage loans as borrowers would be incented to keep low rate mortgages in a rising interest rate environment. Rising rates may dampen the demand for loans from both the consumer and commercial customer as the economy adjusts to higher interest costs. Rising rates would also reduce the value of securities held in the Bank\u2019s investment portfolio. Generally, the value of fixed income securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2014, the fair value of our AFS investment securities totaled $263.9 million and the amortized cost of such securities was $266.2 million. The fair value of our HTM securities totaled $14.3 million and the amortized cost of such securities was $14.3 million. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale in future periods would have an adverse effect on stockholders\u2019 equity.\nShould rates rise, management would take steps to mitigate the loss of income by lengthening the term of liabilities and borrowings, and shortening the average life of assets. We would also work to increase higher yielding assets. Such steps could fail through poor execution or inaccurate timing.\nA Breach of Information Security Could Negatively Affect Our Earnings.\nCape Bank relies on electronic and digital systems and networks throughout all phases of the Bank\u2019s operations. Data processing involving the core operating systems, accounting systems, communication systems that link both employees and the Bank with customers and regulators, reporting and analytical tools used in daily management, are all examples of key systems routinely employed in operations. In addition, we rely on the services of a variety of vendors to meet these needs illustrate that vulnerabilities often reside outside systems in our complete control. Disruptions to our vendors\u2019 systems may arise from events that are wholly or partially beyond our vendors\u2019 control. Both the Bank\u2019s internal systems and those of our vendors could be compromised by viruses, malware, power outages, and cyber attacks. Despite the fact that the Bank has instituted controls and protections such as firewalls, information can be lost or misappropriated. Such issues could result in financial losses, disruption of services to our customers, and significant damage to the Bank\u2019s reputation. These costs or losses could materially exceed the amount of insurance coverage, if any, which would adversely affect our earnings.\nOur Emphasis on Commercial Real Estate Loans and Commercial Business Loans May Continue to Expose Us to Increased Credit Risks.\nAt December 31, 2015, $619.9 million, or 52.8% or our loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans and represented the largest percentage of our loan portfolio. Residential mortgage loans totaled $325.1 million, or 27.7% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2015. In addition, at December 31, 2015, $113.9 million, or 9.7% of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial business loans. Effective December 31, 2013, the Bank exited the residential mortgage loan origination business.\nCommercial real estate loans and commercial business loans generally expose a lender to a greater risk of loss than one-to-four family residential loans. Repayment of commercial real estate and commercial business loans generally depends, in large part, on sufficient income from the property or the borrower\u2019s business to cover operating expenses and debt service. Commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Changes in economic conditions that are beyond the control of the borrower and lender could affect the value of the security for the loan, the future cash flow of the affected property, or the marketability of a construction project with respect to loans originated for the acquisition and development of property. See \u201cBusiness-Lending Activities.\u201d\nOur Concentration of Loans in Our Legacy Shore Market Area May Increase Our Risk.\nCape has moved westward from our traditional markets but the general economic conditions in the southern New Jersey shore communities have a significant influence on the Bank\u2019s success. Over the past four years, the Bank has successfully grown outside of the legacy market which has mitigated but not eliminated this risk. A significant decline in general economic condition caused by inflation, recession, unemployment, or poor summer seasonal weather could adversely affect our financial condition. Further, the gaming industry has declined as a result of competition in neighboring states which has impacted unemployment, related industries, and real estate values. There are no indications that this industry will return to its former economic strength.\nWe Are Subject to Extensive Regulatory Oversight That Could Limit Our Operations, Products and Services, and Make Regulatory Compliance Expensive.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision. Regulators have intensified their focus on bank lending criteria and controls, and on the USA PATRIOT Act\u2019s anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act compliance requirements. Under Dodd-Frank, the structure of bank regulation was changed and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) was created resulting in more extensive regulation over consumer financial products is anticipated. There is also increased scrutiny of our compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d). In order to comply with regulations, guidelines and examination procedures in the anti-money laundering area, we have been required to adopt new policies and procedures and to install new systems. We cannot be certain that the policies, procedures and systems we have in place meet every aspect of current regulation. Therefore, there is no assurance that in every instance we are in full compliance with these requirements. Our failure to comply with these and other regulatory requirements can lead to, among other remedies, administrative enforcement actions, and legal proceedings. In addition, recently enacted, proposed and future legislation and regulations have had, will continue to have, or may have significant impact on the financial services industry. Regulatory or legislative changes could make regulatory compliance more difficult or expensive for us, and could cause us to change or limit some of our products and services, or the way we operate our business.\nAn Inadequate Allowance for Loan Losses Would Negatively Affect Our Results of Operations.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans will not be sufficient to avoid losses. Credit losses are inherent in the lending business and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Volatility and deterioration in the broader economy may also increase our risk of credit losses. The determination of an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses is an inherently uncertain process and is based on numerous assumptions. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, that may be beyond our control, and charge-offs may exceed current estimates. We evaluate the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for loan losses that we believe is appropriate based upon such factors as, including, but not limited to: the risk characteristics of various classifications of loans; previous loan loss experience; specific loans that have loss potential; delinquency trends; the estimated fair market value of the collateral; current economic conditions; the views of our regulators; and geographic and industry loan concentrations. If any of our evaluations are incorrect and borrower defaults result in losses exceeding our allowance for loan losses, our results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected. We cannot be certain that our allowance is appropriate to cover probable loan losses inherent in our portfolio.\nThe Need to Account for Assets at Market Prices May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations.\nWe report certain assets, including investments and securities, at fair value. Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value, we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value. Because we carry these assets on our books at their fair value, we may incur losses even if the asset in question presents minimal credit risk. Given the continued disruption in the capital markets, we may be required to recognize OTTI in future periods with respect to securities in our portfolio. The amount and timing of any impairment recognized will depend on the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of the securities and our estimation of the anticipated recovery period.\nChanges in the Value of Goodwill and Intangible Assets Could Reduce Our Earnings.\nWe are required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually. Testing for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets involves the identification of reporting units and the estimation of fair values. The estimation of fair values involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity in the assumptions used. As of December 31, 2015, if our goodwill and intangible assets were fully impaired and we were required to charge-off all of our goodwill and intangible assets, the pro-forma reduction to our net income would be approximately $1.95 per fully diluted share.", "PERMNO": 92555, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CBNJ"}
