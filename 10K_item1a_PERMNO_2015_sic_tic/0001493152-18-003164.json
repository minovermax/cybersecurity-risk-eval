{"cik": "748592", "company": "NTN BUZZTIME INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-09", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, many of which are not exclusively within our control, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual financial condition and operating results to differ materially from historical or anticipated future financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. We urge investors to carefully consider the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report.\nRisk Factors That May Affect Our Business\nWe may not be able to compete effectively within the highly competitive and evolving interactive games, entertainment and marketing services industries.\nWe face intense competition in the markets in which we operate. We face significant competition for entertainment and marketing services in hospitality venues from other companies offering similar content and services. Our services also compete with games, apps and other forms of entertainment offerings available directly to consumers on their smart phones and tablets. See \u201cITEM 1. Business-Competition,\u201d above. Some of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, including greater financial resources for competitive activities, such as content development and programming, research and development, strategic acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, and sales and marketing. As a result, our current and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or consumer preferences.\nThe increased availability of the internet and wireless networks provides consumers with an increasing number of alternatives to our entertainment offerings. With this increasing competition and the rapid pace of change in product and service offerings, we must be able to compete in terms of technology, content, and management strategy. If we fail to provide competitive, engaging, quality services and products, we will lose revenues to competing companies and technologies. Increased competition may also result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins, longer sales cycles, reduced revenues, and loss of market share.\nNew products and rapid technological change, especially in the mobile and wireless markets, may render our operations obsolete or noncompetitive.\nThe emergence of new entertainment products and technologies, changes in consumer preferences, the adoption of new industry standards, and other factors may limit the life cycle and market penetration of our technologies, products, and services. In particular, the mobile and wireless device, content, applications, social media, and entertainment markets are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Accordingly, our future performance will depend on our ability to:\n\u25cf identify emerging technological trends and industry standards in our market;\n\u25cf identify changing consumer needs, desires, or tastes;\n\u25cf develop and maintain competitive technology, including new hardware and content products and service offerings;\n\u25cf improve the performance, features, and reliability of our existing products and services, particularly in response to changes in consumer preferences, technological changes, and competitive offerings; and\n\u25cf bring technology that is appealing to consumers to the market quickly at cost-effective prices.\nIf we do not compete successfully in developing new products and keep pace with rapid technological change, we will be unable to achieve profitability or sustain a meaningful market position.\nWe may not be successful in developing and marketing new products and services that respond to technological and competitive developments, changing customer needs, and consumer preferences. We may have to incur substantial costs to modify or adapt our products or services to respond to these developments, customer needs, and changing preferences. We must be able to incorporate new technologies into the products we design and develop in order to address the increasingly complex and varied needs of our customer base. Any significant delay or failure in developing new or enhanced technology, including new product and service offerings, could result in a loss of actual or potential market share and a decrease in revenues.\nWe receive a significant portion of our revenues from Buffalo Wild Wings, and any decrease in the amount of their business could materially and adversely affect our cash flow and revenue.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Buffalo Wild Wings accounted for approximately 41%, or $8,678,000, of our total revenue. As of that date, approximately $191,000 was included in accounts receivable. If a significant number of the Buffalo Wild Wings corporate-owned restaurants or its franchisees, or any other customer who may in the future represent a significant portion of our revenue, breach or terminate their subscriptions or otherwise decrease the amount of business they transact with us, we could lose a significant portion of our revenues and cash flow.\nA disruption in the supply of equipment could negatively impact our subscriptions and revenue.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, we began having an unaffiliated third party manufacture an Android-based tablet customized to our specifications. Other than a small amount of inventory of the third-party tablet we have historically used in our BEOND platform, we expect to use our customized tablet on a going-forward basis. This third party manufacturer also manufactures our tablet equipment-tablet charging trays and tablet cases. We currently do not have an alternative manufacturing source for our customized tablet or the tablet equipment or alternatives for the tablet equipment.\nIf our sole manufacturer is delayed in delivering tablets to us, becomes unavailable, has product quality issues, or shortages occur, in addition to not realizing the benefits of having a tablet manufactured to our specifications, we would need to return to the historical third-party tablets or find an alternative device. Similarly, if our sole manufacturer is delayed in delivering the tablet equipment to us, becomes unavailable, has product quality issues, or shortages occur, we may be unable to timely obtain replacement tablet equipment. Delays, unavailability of the tablet or tablet equipment, product quality issues and shortages could damage our reputation and customer loyalty, cause subscription cancellations, increase our expense and reduce our revenue. See also \u201cOur business could be adversely impacted if the sole manufacturer of our customized tablet and tablet equipment is not able to meet our manufacturing quality standards,\u201d below.\nIf our sole manufacturer and/or suppliers were to go out of business or otherwise become unable to meet our needs for reliable equipment, the process of locating and qualifying alternate sources could take months, during which time our production could be delayed, and may, in some cases, require us to redesign our products and systems. Such delays and potentially costly re-sourcing and redesign could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely impacted if the sole manufacturer of our customized tablet and our tablet equipment is not able to meet our manufacturing quality standards.\nAs discussed above, one unaffiliated third party manufactures our customized tablet and our tablet equipment. Continued improvement in supply-chain management and in manufacturing of our customized tablet and tablet equipment and manufacturing quality and product testing are important to our business. Flaws in the design and manufacturing of our customized tablet or tablet equipment or both (by us or our supplier) could result in substantial delays in shipment and in substantial repair, replacement or service costs, could damage our reputation and customer loyalty, could cause subscription cancellations, and could increase our expense and reduce our revenue. Costs associated with tablet or tablet equipment defects due to, for example, problems in our design and manufacturing processes, could include: (a) writing off the value of inventory; (b) disposing of items that cannot be fixed; (c) recalling items that have been shipped; and (d) providing replacements or modifications. These costs could be significant and may increase expenses and lower gross margin. There can be no assurance that our efforts to monitor, develop, modify and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes for our tablet and related equipment will be sufficient to permit us to avoid quality issues. Significant quality issues could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIf we do not adequately protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property or we are subjected to intellectual property claims by others, our business could be seriously damaged.\nWe rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, patents, and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights in our products. We have a small number of patents and patent applications pending in jurisdictions related to our business activities. Our pending patent applications and any future applications might not be approved. Moreover, our patents might not provide us with competitive advantages. Third parties might challenge our patents or trademarks or attempt to use infringing technologies or brands which could harm our ability to compete and reduce our revenues, as well as create significant litigation expense. In addition, patents and trademarks held by third parties might have an adverse effect on our ability to do business and could likewise result in significant litigation expense. Furthermore, third parties might independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or, to the extent patents are issued to us, design around those patents. Others may have filed and, in the future may file, patent applications that are similar or identical to ours. Such third-party patent applications might have priority over our patent applications. To determine the priority of inventions, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Such interference proceedings could result in substantial cost to us.\nWe believe that the success of our business also depends on such factors as the technical expertise and innovative capabilities of our employees. It is our policy that all employees and consultants sign non-disclosure agreements and assignment of invention agreements. Our competitors, former employees, and consultants may, however, misappropriate our technology or independently develop technologies that are as good as or better than ours. Our competitors may also challenge or circumvent our proprietary rights. If we have to initiate or defend against an infringement claim to protect our proprietary rights, the litigation over any such claim, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and costly to us, adversely affecting our financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we hire or retain employees or consultants who may have worked for other companies developing products similar to those that we offer. These other companies may claim that our products are based on their products and that we have misappropriated their intellectual property. Any such claim, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and costly to us, adversely affecting our financial condition.\nWe may be liable for the content and services we make available on our Buzztime network and the internet.\nWe make content and entertainment services available on our Buzztime network and the internet which includes games and game content, software, and a variety of other entertainment content. The availability of this content and services and our branding could result in claims against us based on a variety of theories, including defamation, obscenity, negligence, or copyright or trademark infringement. We could also be exposed to liability for third-party content accessed through the links from our websites to other websites. Federal laws may limit, but not eliminate, our liability for linking to third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights, so long as we comply with certain statutory requirements. We may incur costs to defend against claims related to either our own content or that of third parties, and our financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we are found liable for information that we make available. Implementing measures to reduce our exposure may require us to spend substantial resources and may limit the attractiveness of our services to users which would impair our profitability and harm our business operations.\nOur cash flow may not cover our capital needs and we may need to raise additional funds in the future. Such funds may not be available on favorable terms or at all and, if available, may dilute current stockholders.\nOur capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf our ability to generate cash from operating activities;\n\u25cf acceptance of, and demand for, our interactive games and entertainment;\n\u25cf the costs of continuing to develop and implement our BEOND tablet platform and product line;\n\u25cf the costs of developing new entertainment content, products, or technology or expanding our offering to new media platforms such as the internet and mobile phones;\n\u25cf the extent to which we invest in the creation of new entertainment content and new technology; and\n\u25cf the number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions, if any.\nIn addition, in order to fully execute on our long-term strategic initiatives discussed above under the section entitled \u201cITEM 1. Business-Our Strategy,\u201d we believe we will likely require additional funding in the future. If we need to raise additional funds in the future, such funds may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Furthermore, if we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to continue to develop and implement our BEOND technology platform and product line, develop or enhance our other products and services, successfully execute our business plan or any or all of our strategic initiatives, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements.\nWe have experienced significant losses, and we may incur significant losses in the future.\nWe have a history of significant losses, including net losses of $1,077,000 and $2,923,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and have an accumulated deficit of $129,119,000 as of December 31, 2017. We may also incur future operating and net losses, due in part to expenditures required to continue to implement our business strategies, including the continued development and implementation of our BEOND technology platform and product line. Despite significant expenditures, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Moreover, even if we do achieve profitability, the level of any profitability cannot be predicted and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. See also \u201c-Risks Relating to the Market for Our Common Stock-If we are again determined to be non-compliant with any of the NYSE American continued listing standards within twelve months of May 12, 2017, depending on the nature of such non-compliance, NYSE Regulation may truncate the compliance procedures available to us or immediately initiate delisting proceedings,\u201d below.\nWe may not be able to significantly grow our subscription revenue and implement our other business strategies.\nOur success depends on our ability to increase market awareness and encourage the adoption of the Buzztime brand and our Buzztime network among hospitality venues such as restaurants, sports bars, taverns and pubs, and within the interactive game player community. Our success also depends on our ability to improve customer retention. We may not be able to leverage our resources to expand awareness of and demand for our Buzztime network. In addition, our efforts to improve our game platform and content may not succeed in generating additional demand for our products or in strengthening the loyalty and retention of our existing customers. The degree of market adoption of our Buzztime network will depend on many factors, including consumer preferences, the availability and quality of competing products and services, and our ability to leverage our brand.\nOur success also depends on our ability to implement our other business strategies, which include developing our BEOND tablet platform that allows for consumer play across the digital platform, developing more premium content that allow us to grow the revenue stream directly from consumers, developing dynamic menuing and point-of-sale, or POS, integration competency, and growing our marketing services and sponsorship revenues. Implementing these strategies will require us to dedicate significant resources to, among other things, fully developing and implementing our BEOND tablet platform and product line, expanding our other product offerings, customizing our products and services to meet the unique needs of select accounts, and expanding and improving our marketing services and promotional efforts. We may be unable to successfully implement these strategies as currently planned.\nOur products and services are subject to government regulations that may restrict our operations or cause demand for our products to decline significantly.\nIn addition to laws and regulations applicable to businesses generally, we are also subject to laws and regulations that apply specifically to the interactive entertainment and product marketing industries. In addition, we operate games of chance and, in some instances, we may provide items of nominal value (e.g., key chains, etc.) to the venue that hosts a game, and the venue may award such items to consumers. These games are regulated in many jurisdictions and the laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. See \u201cITEM 1. BUSINESS-Government Regulations.\u201d\nWe may find it necessary to eliminate, modify, suspend, or cancel certain features of our products (including the games we offer) in certain jurisdictions based on the adoptions of new laws and regulations or changes in law or regulations or the enforcement thereof, which could result in additional development costs and/or the loss of customers and revenue.\nCommunication or other system failures could result in customer cancellations and a decrease in our revenues.\nWe rely on continuous operation of our information technology and communications systems, and those of a variety of third parties, to communicate with and to distribute our services to the locations of our network subscribers. We currently transmit our data to our customers via broadband internet connections including telephone and cable TV networks. Both our communications systems and those of third parties on which we rely are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, floods, storms, fires, power loss, telecommunications and other network failures, equipment failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service or other attacks, and other causes. These systems are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, vandalism, and to other disruptions, for example if we or the operators of these systems and system facilities have financial difficulties. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our system protections and disaster recovery plans cannot prevent all outages, errors, or data losses. In addition, our services and systems are highly technical and complex and may contain errors or other vulnerabilities. Any errors or vulnerabilities in our products and services, damage to or failure of our systems, any natural or man-made disaster, or other unanticipated problems at our facilities or those of a third party, could result in lengthy interruptions in our service to our customers, which could reduce our revenues and cash flow, and damage our brand. Any interruption in communications or failure of proper hardware or software function at our or our customers\u2019 venues could also decrease customer loyalty and satisfaction and result in a cancellation of our services.\nOur success depends on our ability to recruit and retain skilled professionals.\nOur business requires experienced programmers, creative designers, application developers, and sales and marketing personnel. Our success will depend on identifying, hiring, training, and retaining such experienced and knowledgeable professionals. We must recruit and retain talented professionals in order for our business to grow. There is significant competition for the individuals with the skills required to develop the products and perform the services we offer. We may be unable to attract a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future to sustain and grow our business, and we may not be successful in motivating and retaining the individuals we are able to attract. If we cannot attract, motivate, and retain qualified technical and sales and marketing professionals, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will suffer.\nWe have incurred significant net operating loss carryforwards that we will likely be unable to use.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had federal income tax net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $66,554,000, portions of which will continue expiring in 2018. As of December 31, 2017, we had state income tax NOL carryforwards of approximately $29,185,000, portions of which will continue expiring in 2018. We believe that our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards may be substantially restricted by the passage of time and the limitations of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which apply when there are certain changes in ownership of a corporation. To the extent we begin to realize significant taxable income, these Section 382 limitations may result in our incurring federal income tax liability notwithstanding the existence of otherwise available NOL carryforwards. We have established a full valuation allowance for substantially all of our deferred tax assets, including the NOL carryforwards, since we do not believe we are likely to generate future taxable income to realize these assets.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks and incidents.\nOur business involves transmitting payment information of our customers and certain personal information of consumers (such as their name, date of birth, and email address). In the future, we may store and transmit additional personal information of consumers, particularly as the services of the BEOND tablet platform become more advanced to include POS integration. While we have implemented measures designed to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, any failure of these measures and/or any material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, employee errors and/or malfeasance could potentially lead to the compromise of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, system downtimes, and operational disruptions. In addition, a cyber-related attack could result in other negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, remediation or increased protection costs, litigation or regulatory action.\nWe could become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements as we introduce features in direct payments from consumers.\nIn preparation for expanding features and functionality to our BEOND tablet platform that involve us accepting credit card and other forms of payments directly from consumers, we certified our compliance with Payment Card Industry (\u201cPCI\u201d) Data Security Standard v3.1 as a service provider, and will be required to do so annually. Compliance with additional regulations and requirements may be difficult for us; thereby limiting our ability to grow the amount of revenue we receive directly from consumers. In addition to these additional regulations and requirements, if we fail to comply with the rules or requirements of any provider of a payment method we accept, if the volume of fraud in our transactions limits or terminates our rights to use payment methods we accept, or if a data breach occurs relating to our payment systems, we may, among other things, be subject to fines or higher transaction fees and may lose, or face restrictions placed upon, our ability to accept credit card and debit card payments from consumers.\nRisks Relating to the Market for Our Common Stock\nIf we are again determined to be non-compliant with any of the NYSE American continued listing standards within twelve months of May 12, 2017, depending on the nature of such non-compliance, NYSE Regulation may truncate the compliance procedures available to us or immediately initiate delisting proceedings.\nOn May 12, 2017, as previously reported, we received a letter from NYSE Regulation Inc. notifying us that we have regained compliance with Sections 1003(a)(ii) and (iii) of the NYSE American Company Guide. As previously reported, NYSE Regulation previously notified us that we were not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) because we reported stockholders\u2019 equity of less than $6 million as of September 30, 2015 and had net losses in five of our most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2014, and that we were not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(ii) because we reported stockholders\u2019 equity of less than $4 million as of December 31, 2015 and had net losses in three of our four most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2015.\nWe believe that the NYSE Regulation may notify us that we are not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) because our stockholders\u2019 equity was less than $6 million as of December 31, 2017 (it was $5,536,000) and because we had net losses in five of our most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2017. As of March 9, 2018, we have not received such a notice from the NYSE Regulation. In accordance with Section 1009(h) of the Company Guide, if we are again determined to be below any of the NYSE American continued listing standards within twelve months of May 12, 2017, NYSE Regulation will examine the relationship between the two incidents of noncompliance and re-evaluate our method of financial recovery from the first incident. NYSE Regulation will then take appropriate action, which, depending on the circumstances, may include truncating the compliance procedures described in Section 1009 of the Company Guide or immediately initiating delisting proceedings.\nWe are exploring options to address our low stockholders\u2019 equity. We can give no assurances that we will be able to address it successfully, or that, if we receive a notice of non-compliance from NYSE Regulation, that we will be able to address such non-compliance or, even if we do, that we will be able to maintain the listing of our common stock on the NYSE American. In addition, we may determine to pursue business opportunities or grow our business at levels or on timelines that further reduces our stockholders\u2019 equity below the level required to maintain compliance with NYSE American continued listing standards. The delisting of our common stock for whatever reason could, among other things, substantially impair our ability to raise additional capital; result in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer financing opportunities for us; and/or result in potential breaches of representations or covenants of our warrants or other agreements pursuant to which we made representations or covenants relating to our compliance with applicable listing requirements. Claims related to any such breaches, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, significant liabilities and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations. In addition, the delisting of our common stock for whatever reason may materially impair our stockholders\u2019 ability to buy and sell shares of our common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our common stock.\nIf our common stock were delisted and determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock in the secondary market.\nIf our common stock were delisted or suspended from trading on the NYSE American, it may be subject to the so-called \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange. For any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d unless exempt, the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. If our common stock were delisted and determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock historically has been and likely will continue to be highly volatile and our common stock is thinly traded.\nThe market price for our common stock historically has been highly volatile, and the market for our common stock has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, based both on our operating performance and for reasons that appear to us unrelated to our operating performance. Our stock is also thinly traded, which can affect market volatility, which could significantly affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance. In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf the level of our financial resources;\n\u25cf announcements of entry into or consummation of a financing;\n\u25cf announcements of new products or technologies, commercial relationships or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements of difficulties or delays in entering into commercial relationships with our customers;\n\u25cf changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or deviations in our business and the trading price of our common stock from the estimates of securities analysts;\n\u25cf fluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies;\n\u25cf sales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by significant stockholders, our executive officers or our directors or pursuant to shelf or resale registration statements that register shares of our common stock that may be sold by us or certain of our current or future stockholders;\n\u25cf discussion of us or our stock price by the financial press and in online investor communities;\n\u25cf announcement of non-compliance with any of the NYSE American continued listing standards;\n\u25cf commencement of delisting proceedings by NYSE Regulation; and\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel.\nThe realization of any of the foregoing could have a dramatic and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the anticipation of such sales could have a material adverse effect on then-prevailing market prices.\nIn April 2017, March 2017, and November 2016, we sold an aggregate of approximately 642,000 shares of our common stock in registered direct offerings. In a private placement we completed in November 2013, we issued approximately 120,000 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase approximately 72,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $20.00 per share. A registration statement registering the resale of the shares we issued in such private placement and the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants we issued in such private placement is currently effective, and we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain such registration statement continuously effective until all such registered shares have been sold.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2017, there were approximately 156,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock outstanding. The holders of such shares may elect to convert them into shares of our common stock at any time. Based on the current conversion price, we would issue approximately 11,000 shares of our common stock if all of the outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock were so converted. Generally, all of the shares of common stock we may issue upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock may be sold under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933.\nAs of December 31, 2017, there were also approximately 156,000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options at exercise prices ranging from $5.10 to $35.00 per share. Registration statements registering such shares of common stock are currently effective.\nAccordingly, a significant number of shares of our common stock could be sold at any time. Depending upon market liquidity at the time our common stock is resold by the holders thereof, such resales could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. In addition, the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to obtain future financing. To the extent the trading price of our common stock at the time of exercise of any of our outstanding options or warrants exceeds their exercise price, such exercise will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders and may restrict our operations.\nWe may raise additional capital at any time and may do so through one or more financing alternatives, including public or private sales of equity or debt securities directly to investors or through underwriters or placement agents. As discussed above, we are exploring options to address our non-compliance with the NYSE American continued listing standards, in particular, options to address our low stockholders\u2019 equity. We have a shelf registration statement on file under which we could currently sell up to approximately $23.2 million worth of securities. See also \u201cOur ability to raise capital may be limited by applicable laws and regulations,\u201d below. Raising capital through the issuance of common stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock) may depress the market price of our stock and may substantially dilute our existing stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may issue preferred stock with rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of the holders of our common stock. Debt financings could involve covenants that restrict our operations. These restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets, as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens or make investments and may, among other things, preclude us from making distributions to stockholders (either by paying dividends or redeeming stock) and taking other actions beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, investors could impose more one-sided investment terms and conditions on companies that have or are perceived to have limited remaining funds or limited ability to raise additional funds. The lower our cash balance, the more difficult it is likely to be for us to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nOur ability to raise capital may be limited by applicable laws and regulations.\nOver the past few years we have raised capital through the sale of our equity securities. The offerings we completed in April 2014, November 2016, March 2017 and April 2017 were equity offerings conducted under the \u201cshelf\u201d registration statement on Form S-3. Using a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 to raise additional capital generally takes less time and is less expensive than other means, such as conducting an offering under a Form S-1 registration statement. However, our ability to raise capital using a shelf registration statement may be limited by, among other things, current SEC rules and regulations. Under current SEC rules and regulations, we must meet certain requirements to use a Form S-3 registration statement to raise capital without restriction as to the amount of the market value of securities sold thereunder. One such requirement is that we periodically evaluate the market value of our outstanding shares of common stock held by non-affiliates, or public float, and if, at an evaluation date, our public float is less than $75.0 million, then the aggregate market value of securities sold by us or on our behalf under the Form S-3 in any 12-month period is limited to an aggregate of one-third of our public float. Our public float is currently approximately $8.1 million and therefore we are currently subject to the one-third of our public float limitation. Assuming our public float remains the same amount the next time we are required to evaluate it, we will only be able to sell up to an additional approximately $2.7 million using the \u201cshelf\u201d registration statement. If our ability to utilize a Form S-3 registration statement for a primary offering of our securities is limited to one-third of our public float, we may conduct such an offering pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act or under a Form S-1 registration statement, and we would expect either of those alternatives to increase the cost of raising additional capital relative to utilizing a Form S-3 registration statement.\nIn addition, under current SEC rules and regulations, our common stock must be listed and registered on a national securities exchange in order to utilize a Form S-3 registration statement (i) for a primary offering, if our public float is not at least $75.0 million as of a date within 60 days prior to the date of filing the Form S-3 or a re-evaluation date, whichever is later, and (ii) to register the resale of our securities by persons other than us (i.e., a resale offering). While currently our common stock is listed on the NYSE American, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such listing. See also our risk factor \u201cAlthough we have regained compliance with the continued listing standards of the NYSE American with which we were previously not compliant, if we are again determined to be non-compliant with any of its continued listing standards within twelve months of May 12, 2017, depending on the nature of such non-compliance, NYSE Regulation may truncate the compliance procedures available to us or immediately initiate delisting proceedings\u201d above.\nOur ability to timely raise sufficient additional capital also may be limited by the NYSE American\u2019s stockholder approval requirements for transactions involving the issuance of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock. For instance, the NYSE American requires that we obtain stockholder approval of any transaction involving the sale, issuance or potential issuance by us of our common stock (or securities convertible into our common stock) at a price less than the greater of book or market value, which (together with sales by our officers, directors and principal stockholders) equals 20% or more of our then outstanding common stock, unless the transaction is considered a \u201cpublic offering\u201d by the NYSE American staff. In addition, certain prior sales by us may be aggregated with any offering we may propose in the future, further limiting the amount we could raise in any future offering that is not considered a public offering by the NYSE American staff and involves the sale, issuance or potential issuance by us of our common stock (or securities convertible into our common stock) at a price less than the greater of book or market value. The NYSE American also requires that we obtain stockholder approval if the issuance or potential issuance of additional shares will be considered by the NYSE American staff to result in a change of control of our company.\nObtaining stockholder approval is a costly and time-consuming process. If we are required to obtain stockholder approval for a potential transaction, we would expect to spend substantial additional money and resources. In addition, seeking stockholder approval would delay our receipt of otherwise available capital, which may materially and adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy, and there is no guarantee our stockholders ultimately would approve a proposed transaction. A public offering under the NYSE American rules typically involves broadly announcing the proposed transaction, which often times has the effect of depressing the issuer\u2019s stock price. Accordingly, the price at which we could sell our securities in a public offering may be less, and the dilution existing stockholders experience may in turn be greater, than if we were able to raise capital through other means.\nOur charter contains provisions that may hinder or prevent a change in control of our company, which could result in our inability to approve a change in control and potentially receive a premium over the current market value of your stock.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if such a change in control would benefit our stockholders, or to make changes in our board of directors. For example, our certificate of incorporation (i) prohibits stockholders from filling vacancies on our board of directors, calling special stockholder meetings, or taking action by written consent, and (ii) requires a supermajority vote of at least 80% of the total voting power of our outstanding shares, voting together as a single class, to remove our directors from office or to amend provisions relating to stockholders taking action by written consent or calling special stockholder meetings.\nAdditionally, our certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company. Some of these provisions:\n\u25cf authorize the issuance of preferred stock which can be created and issued by our board of directors without prior stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of the common stock;\n\u25cf prohibit our stockholders from making certain changes to our bylaws except with 66 2/3% stockholder approval; and\n\u25cf require advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations.\nThese provisions could discourage third parties from taking control of our company. Such provisions may also impede a transaction in which you could receive a premium over then current market prices and your ability to approve a transaction that you consider in your best interest.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, restated bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors, including delaying or impeding a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving our company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 76963, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "NTN"}
