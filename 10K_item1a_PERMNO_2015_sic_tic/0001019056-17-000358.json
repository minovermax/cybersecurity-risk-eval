{"cik": "65596", "company": "SIEBERT FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nSecurities market volatility and other securities industry risk could adversely affect our business\nMost of our revenues are derived from our securities brokerage business. Like other businesses operating in the securities industry, our business is directly affected by volatile trading markets, fluctuations in the volume of market activity, economic and political conditions, upward and downward trends in business and finance at large, legislation and regulation affecting the national and international business and financial communities, currency values, inflation, market conditions, the availability and cost of short-term or long-term funding and capital, the credit capacity or perceived credit-worthiness of the securities industry in the marketplace and the level and volatility of interest rates. We also face risks relating to trading losses, losses resulting from the ownership or underwriting of securities, counterparty failure to meet commitments, customer fraud, employee fraud, issuer fraud, errors and misconduct, failures in connection with the processing of securities transactions and litigation. A reduction in our revenues or a loss resulting from our ownership of securities or sales or trading of securities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, as a result of these risks, our revenues and operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter and from year to year.\nLower price levels in the securities markets may reduce our profitability.\nLower price levels of securities may result in (i) reduced volumes of securities, options and futures transactions, with a consequent reduction in our commission revenues, and (ii) losses from declines in the market value of securities we held in investment. In periods of low volume, our levels of profitability are further adversely affected because certain of our expenses remain relatively fixed. Sudden sharp declines in market values of securities and the failure of issuers and counterparties to perform their obligations can result in illiquid markets which, in turn, may result in our having difficulty selling securities. Such negative market conditions, if prolonged, may lower our revenues. A reduction in our revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere is intense competition in the brokerage industry.\nSiebert encounters significant competition from full-commission, online and other discount brokerage firms, as well as from financial institutions, mutual fund sponsors and other organizations many of which are significantly larger and better capitalized than Siebert. Over the past several years, price wars and lower commission rates in the discount brokerage business in general have strengthened our competitors. Siebert believes that such changes in the industry will continue to strengthen existing competitors and attract additional competitors such as banks, insurance companies, providers of online financial and information services, and others. Many of these competitors are larger, more diversified, have greater capital resources, and offer a wider range of services and financial products than Siebert. Siebert competes with a wide variety of vendors of financial services for the same customers. Siebert may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors.\nSome competitors in the discount brokerage business offer services which we may not. In addition, some competitors have continued to offer flat rate execution fees that are lower than our published rates. Industry-wide changes in trading practices are expected to cause continuing pressure on fees earned by discount brokers for the sale of order flow. Continued or increased competition from ultra-low cost, flat fee brokers and broader service offerings from other discount brokers could limit our growth or lead to a decline in Siebert\u2019s customer base which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to protect client data or prevent breaches of our information systems could expose us to liability or reputational damage.\nWe are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations and with our clients and vendors. As the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continue to grow, the potential risk of security breaches and cyber-attacks increases. As a financial services company, we are continuously subject to cyber-attacks by third parties. Any such security breach could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, vulnerabilities of our external service providers and other third parties could pose security risks to client information. The secure transmission of confidential information over public networks is also a critical element of our operations.\nIn providing services to clients, we manage, utilize and store sensitive and confidential client data, including personal data. As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as U.S. federal and state laws and foreign regulations governing the protection of personally identifiable information. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict. If any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients. Similarly, unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our employees or third parties, including a cyber-attack by third parties who may deploy viruses, worms or other malicious software programs, could result in negative publicity, significant remediation costs, legal liability, and damage to our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, our liability insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches.\nOur advisory services subject us to additional risks.\nWe have provided investment advisory services to investors through our registered Registered Investment Advisor, SIA. SIA intends to offer Robo advisory and investment services. The risks associated with these investment advisory activities include those arising from possible conflicts of interest, unsuitable investment recommendations, inadequate due diligence, inadequate disclosure and fraud. Realization of these risks could lead to liability for client losses, regulatory fines, civil penalties and harm to our reputation and business.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States, at both the Federal and state level. We are also subject to regulation by self-regulatory organizations and other regulatory bodies in the United States, such as the SEC, the NYSE, FINRA and the MSRB. We are registered as a broker-dealer in 50 states and the District of Columbia. The regulations to which we are subject as a broker-dealer cover all aspects of the securities business including: training of personnel, sales methods, trading practices, uses and safe keeping of customers\u2019 funds and securities, capital structure, record keeping, fee arrangements, disclosure and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. Failure to comply with any of these laws, rules or regulations, which may be subject to the uncertainties of interpretation, could result in civil penalties, fines, suspension or expulsion and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe laws, rules and regulations, as well as governmental policies and accounting principles, governing our business and the financial services and banking industries generally have changed significantly over recent years and are expected to continue to do so. We cannot predict which changes in laws, rules, regulations, governmental policies or accounting principles will be adopted. Any changes in the laws, rules, regulations, governmental policies or accounting principles relating to our business could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLegislation has and may continue to result in changes to rules and regulations applicable to our business, which may negatively impact our business and financial results.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), enacted in 2010, requires many federal agencies to adopt new rules and regulations applicable to the financial services industry and also calls for many studies regarding various industry practices. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the SEC discretion to adopt rules regarding standards of conduct for broker-dealers providing investment advice to retail customers. The U.S. Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d) has enacted regulations changing the definition of who is an investment advice fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and how such advice can be provided to account holders in retirement accounts such as 401(k) plans and Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs). The DOL regulations will deem many of the investment, rollover and asset management recommendations from us to our clients regarding their retirement accounts fiduciary \u201cinvestment advice\u201d under ERISA. One of the most significant impacts on our business from the DOL regulations and related prohibited transaction exemptions will be the impact on our fee and compensation practices. For example, the regulations make investment advisors to retirement account clients subject to an ERISA fiduciary duty standard and the exemptions seek to reduce conflicts of interest stemming from fee differentials and compensation incentives that could lead to a misalignment of the interests of advisors and their retirement investor clients. The exemptions, when used, will also require certain new client contracts, adherence to \u201cimpartial conduct standards\u201d (including a requirement to act in the \u201cbest interest\u201d of retirement clients when providing investment advice), the adoption of related policies and procedures and the making of extensive website and other disclosures to retirement investors and the DOL. One way to comply is to use the best interest contract exemption in connection with certain advice activities, which will subject us to an increased risk of class actions and other litigation and regulatory risks. Additional rulemaking or legislative action could negatively impact our business and financial results. While we have not yet been required to make other material changes to our business or operations as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act or other rulemaking or legislative action, it is not certain what the scope of future rulemaking or interpretive guidance from the SEC, FINRA, DOL, banking regulators and other regulatory agencies may be, how the courts and regulators might interpret these rules and what impact this will have on our compliance costs, business, operations and profitability.\nOur profitability could also be affected by new or modified laws that impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes to the laws governing banking, the securities market, fiduciary duties, conflicts of interest, taxation, electronic commerce, client privacy and security of client data.\nWe are subject to net capital requirements.\nThe SEC, FINRA, and various other securities and commodities exchanges and other regulatory bodies in the United States have rules with respect to net capital requirements which affect us. These rules have the effect of requiring that at least a substantial portion of a broker-dealer\u2019s assets be kept in cash or highly liquid investments. Our compliance with the net capital requirements could limit operations that require intensive use of capital, such as underwriting or trading activities. These rules could also restrict our ability to withdraw our capital, even in circumstances where we have more than the minimum amount of required capital, which, in turn, could limit our ability to implement growth strategies. In addition, a change in such rules, or the imposition of new rules, affecting the scope, coverage, calculation or amount of such net capital requirements, or a significant operating loss or any unusually large charge against net capital, could have similar adverse effects.\nOur customers may fail to pay us.\nA principal credit risk to which we are exposed on a regular basis is that our customers may fail to pay for their purchases or fail to maintain the minimum required collateral for amounts borrowed against securities positions maintained by them. We cannot assure you that our practices and/or the policies and procedures we have established will be adequate to prevent a significant credit loss.\nAn increase in volume on our systems or other events could cause them to malfunction.\nDuring 2016, we received and processed approximately 61% of our trade orders electronically. This method of trading is heavily dependent on the integrity of the electronic systems supporting it. While we have never experienced a significant failure of our trading systems, heavy stress placed on our systems during peak trading times could cause our systems to operate at unacceptably low speeds or fail altogether. Any significant degradation or failure of our systems or the systems of third parties involved in the trading process (e.g., online and Internet service providers, record keeping and data processing functions performed by third parties, and third party software), even for a short time, could cause customers to suffer delays in trading. These delays could cause substantial losses for customers and could subject us to claims from these customers for losses. There can be no assurance that our network structure will operate appropriately in the event of a subsystem, component or software failure. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to prevent an extended systems failure in the event of a power or telecommunications failure, an earthquake, terrorist attack, fire or any act of God. Any systems failure that causes interruptions in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe rely on information processing and communications systems to process and record our transactions.\nOur operations rely heavily on information processing and communications systems. Our system for processing securities transactions is highly automated. Failure of our information processing or communications systems for a significant period of time could limit our ability to process a large volume of transactions accurately and rapidly. This could cause us to be unable to satisfy our obligations to customers and other securities firms, and could result in regulatory violations. External events, such as an earthquake, terrorist attack or power failure, loss of external information feeds, such as security price information, as well as internal malfunctions such as those that could occur during the implementation of system modifications, could render part or all of these systems inoperative.\nRapid market or technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and services to our clients.\nWe must continue to enhance and improve our technology and electronic services. The electronic financial services industry is characterized by significant structural changes, increasingly complex systems and infrastructures, changes in clients\u2019 needs and preferences and new business models. If new industry standards and practices emerge and our competitors release new technology before us, our existing technology, systems and electronic trading services may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed. Our future success will depend on our ability to:\n\u2022 enhance our existing products and services;\n\u2022 develop and/or license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our clients and prospective clients;\n\u2022 continue to attract highly-skilled technology personnel; and\n\u2022 respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis.\nDeveloping our electronic services, our implementation and utilization of our use of the Robo investment advisor platform and other technology entails significant technical and business risks. We may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our electronic trading platform, information databases and network infrastructure to client requirements or emerging industry standards. If we face material delays in introducing new services, products and enhancements, our clients may forego the use of our products and use those of our competitors.\nFurther, the adoption of new Internet, networking or telecommunications technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify and adapt our services. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and transaction-processing systems to client requirements or emerging industry standards. We cannot assure you that we will be able to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or client requirements.\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nWe are dependent upon our new and continuing senior management for our success and the loss of the services of any of these individuals could significantly harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits of the change in control or it may take longer than anticipated for us to realize any benefits from increased cost efficiencies or economies of scale, if at all.\nOur realization of the benefits anticipated as a result of the Acquisition Agreement and change in control will depend in part on the ability of our new management team, led by our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Andrew H. Reich, to implement the Company\u2019s business plan (See Recent Events). We cannot assure shareholders that there will not be substantial costs associated with the transition process, the Company\u2019s new products or other negative consequences as a result of the change in management. These effects, including, but not limited to, incurring unexpected costs or delays in connection with implantation of a modified business model, or the failure of our business to perform as expected, could harm our results of operations.\nOur principal shareholder has the ability to control key decisions submitted to a vote of our shareholders.\nKCA currently owns approximately 90% of our outstanding common stock and Gloria E. Gebbia, who is a director of the Company, and the managing member of KCA, has the power to elect the entire Board of Directors and, except as otherwise provided by law or our Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws, to approve any action requiring shareholder approval without a shareholders meeting.\nThere may be no public market for our common stock.\nOnly approximately 1,900,000 shares of common stock, or approximately 9% of our shares of Common Stock outstanding, are currently held by the public. Although our Common Stock is traded in The NASDAQ Capital Market, there can be no assurance that an active public market will continue.\nOur future ability to pay dividends to holders of our Common Stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows.\nPayment of future cash dividends on our Common Stock will depend on our ability to generate earnings and cash flows. However, sufficient cash may not be available to pay such dividends. Payment of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon a number of factors that the board of directors deems relevant, including future earnings, the success of our business activities, capital requirements, the general financial condition and future prospects of our business and general business conditions. If we are unable to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business, we may not be able to pay dividends on our Common Stock.\nOur ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock is also dependent on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to SFC. MSCO is subject to requirements of the SEC and FINRA relating to liquidity, capital standards and the use of client funds and securities, which may limit funds available for the payment of dividends to SFC.", "PERMNO": 53373, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "SIEB"}
