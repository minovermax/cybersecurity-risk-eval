RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as other information included in this Annual Report and in our other public filings. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such case, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your original investment. This Annual Report also contains forward-looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks and uncertainties described below.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThe novel coronavirus disease (or COVID-19) pandemic is expected to have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on our business and financial performance, and we expect this adverse impact to continue. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including the duration, severity and any resurgences of the pandemic, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in response to government mandates or recommendations, as well as decisions we have made to protect the health and safety of our employees, consumers and communities, we temporarily closed a significant number of our stores globally. While most of our stores have reopened, we may face new or longer term store closure requirements and other operational restrictions with respect to some or all of our physical locations for prolonged periods of time due to, among other factors, evolving and increasingly stringent governmental restrictions including public health directives, quarantine policies or social distancing measures. In particular, given the recent resurgence in the COVID-19 pandemic, we again have had to close stores and may need to again close a significant number of our stores in the future. In addition, many of our customers, including significant customers in our wholesale and franchise distribution channels, have closed many of their stores, either temporarily or permanently, which has adversely impacted our revenues from these customers and franchisees. As a result, we expect our financial results to be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, consumer fears about becoming ill with the disease may continue, which has and is likely to continue to adversely affect foot traffic to our and our customers' stores. Consumer spending generally may also be negatively impacted by general macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence, including the impacts of any recession, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This may negatively impact sales in our stores and our e-commerce channel and may cause our wholesale customers to purchase fewer products from us. Furthermore, if sales do not meet expectations because of unexpected effects on consumer demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the resulting surplus inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower than planned gross margins. Any continued significant reduction in consumer visits to, or spending at, our and our customers' stores, caused by COVID-19, and any continued decreased spending at stores or online caused by decreased consumer confidence and spending following the pandemic, would result in a loss of sales and profits and, as a result, adversely impact our financial results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also has the potential to significantly impact our supply chain if the factories that manufacture our products, the distribution centers where we manage our inventory, or the operations of our logistics and other service providers are disrupted, temporarily closed or experience worker shortages. We may also see disruptions or delays in shipments and negative impacts to pricing of certain components of our products.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including related governmental guidance or requirements, we also have recently closed many of our corporate office and other facilities, including our corporate headquarters in San Francisco, and have implemented a work from home policy for many of our corporate employees. This policy may negatively impact productivity and cause other disruptions to our business. Longer term, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may also threaten the health of our employees and adversely impact our health care costs.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as information is rapidly evolving with respect to the duration and severity of the pandemic. At this point, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, or its overall impact on our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation of our brands.\nOur success depends in large part on the value, overall health and reputation of our brands, which are integral to our business and the implementation of our \"Brand Led\" strategy for expanding our business. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brands will depend largely on the success of our marketing, design and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide consistent, high-quality products supported by engaging marketing campaigns. Our brands and reputation could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives, if we fail to deliver high- quality products acceptable to our customers and consumers or if we face or mishandle a product recall.\nOur brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our brands, corporate integrity and culture. Negative claims or publicity involving us or our products, or the production methods of any of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, could seriously damage our reputation, sales and brand image, regardless of whether such claims or publicity are accurate. Social media, which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative claims or publicity, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims or publicity. In addition, we or our senior executives may from time to time take positions on social issues that may be unpopular with some customers or potential customers, which may impact our ability to attract or retain such customers. Adverse publicity could undermine consumer confidence in our brands and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if such publicity is unfounded. Any harm to our brands and reputation could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe depend on a group of key wholesale customers for a significant portion of our revenues. A significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer's performance or financial position could harm our business and financial condition.\nSales to our top ten wholesale customers accounted for 29%, 26% and 27% of our total net revenues in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. No single customer represented 10% or more of our net revenues in any of these years. While we have long-standing relationships with our wholesale customers, we do not have long-term contracts with them. As a result, purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis, and the relationship, as well as particular orders, can generally be terminated by either party at any time. If any major wholesale customer decreases or ceases its purchases from us, cancels its orders, delays or defaults on its payment obligations to us, reduces the floor space, assortments, fixtures or advertising for our products or changes its manner of doing business with us for any reason, such as due to store closures, decreased foot traffic or recession resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, such actions are expected to adversely affect our business and financial condition. Furthermore, certain of our major wholesale customers may seek to distribute our products globally in a manner or at prices that impact the positioning that we seek to promote in our other channels of distribution. In addition, a decline in the performance or financial condition of a major wholesale customer- including bankruptcy or liquidation- could result in a adverse impact on revenues and cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer, require us to assume more credit risk relating to our receivables from that customer or limit our ability to collect amounts related to previous purchases by that customer. For example, our wholesale customer, Sears Holdings Corporation, including Kmart, and our wholesale customer, J.C. Penney are currently undergoing bankruptcy proceedings. Permanent store closures and other developments in these proceedings have adversely affected our sales to these customers. We expect additional closures and other developments in these proceedings will likely adversely affect our sales to these customers in the future, even if they continue operations. In addition, store closures, decreased foot traffic and recession resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely affect the performance and will likely adversely affect the financial condition of many of these customers. The foregoing are expected to have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur efforts to expand our retail business may not be successful, which could impact our operating results.\nOne of our key strategic priorities is our \u201cDTC First\u201d strategy, which includes our plan to become a leading world-class omni-channel retailer by expanding our consumer reach in brand-dedicated stores globally, including making selective investments in company-operated stores and e-commerce sites, franchisee and other brand-dedicated store models. In many locations, we face major, established retail competitors that may be able to better attract consumers and execute their retail strategies. In addition, a retail operating model involves substantial investments in equipment and property, information systems, inventory and personnel. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with these investments, a decline in sales or the closure of or poor performance of stores, including the closure of stores and decreased foot traffic resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant costs and impacts to our margins. Our ability to grow our retail channel also depends on the availability and cost of real estate that meets our criteria for foot traffic, square footage, demographics and other factors. Failure to identify and secure adequate new locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of the fleet of stores, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, our investments in customer, digital, and omni-channel shopping initiatives may not deliver the results we anticipate. These initiatives involve significant investments in IT systems, data science and artificial intelligence initiatives, and significant operational changes. Our competitors are also investing in omni-channel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives. If the implementation of our customer, digital, and omni-channel initiatives is not successful, or\nwe do not realize the return on our investments in these initiatives that we anticipate, our operating results would be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to effectively execute our e-commerce business, our reputation and operating results may be harmed.\nWhile e-commerce still comprises a small portion of our net revenues, it has been our fastest growing business over the last several years and it is a key part of our \u201cDTC First\u201d strategy. The success of our e-commerce business depends, in part, on third parties and factors over which we have limited control, including changing consumer preferences and buying trends relating to e-commerce usage, both domestically and abroad, and promotional or other advertising initiatives employed by our wholesale customers or other third parties on their e-commerce sites. Any failure on our part, or on the part of our third-party digital partners, to provide attractive, reliable, secure and user-friendly e-commerce platforms could negatively impact our consumers\u2019 shopping experience, resulting in reduced website traffic, diminished loyalty to our brands and lost sales. In addition, as we continue to expand and increase the global presence of our e-commerce business, sales from our retail stores and wholesale channels of distribution in areas where e-commerce sites are introduced may decline due to changes in consumer shopping habits and cannibalization.\nWe are also vulnerable to certain additional risks and uncertainties associated with our e-commerce sites, including:\n\u2022changes in required technology interfaces;\n\u2022website downtime and other technical failures;\n\u2022costs and technical issues from website software upgrades;\n\u2022data and system security;\n\u2022computer viruses; and\n\u2022changes in applicable federal and state regulations.\nIn addition, we must keep up to date with competitive technology trends, including the use of new or improved technology, creative user interfaces and other e-commerce marketing tools such as paid search and mobile applications, among others, which may increase our costs and which may not succeed in increasing sales or attracting consumers. For example, it is possible that consumers may not sign up for our loyalty program at anticipated rates if they do not find the features and benefits compelling, and that we may not realize the benefits that we anticipate from these programs. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect the sales in our e-commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands.\nAdditionally, the success of our e-commerce business and the satisfaction of our consumers depend on their timely receipt of our products. The efficient flow of our products requires that our company-operated and third-party operated distribution facilities have adequate capacity to support the current level of e-commerce operations and any anticipated increased levels that may follow from the growth of our e-commerce business. If we encounter difficulties with our distribution facilities or in our relationships with the third parties who operate the facilities, or if any such facilities were to shut down or be limited in capacity for any reason, including as a result of fire, other natural disaster, labor disruption, or pandemic (including as a consequence of public health directives, quarantine policies or social distancing measures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic), we could face shortages of inventory, resulting in \"out of stock\" conditions in the e-commerce sites we operate and those operated by our wholesale customers or other third parties, and we could experience disruption or delay, or incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our consumers and experience dissatisfaction from our consumers. Any of these issues could have an adverse effect on our business and harm our reputation.\nWe may be unable to maintain or increase our sales through our third-party distribution channels.\nIn addition to our brand-dedicated company-operated retail stores and e-commerce sites, our third-party distribution channels include department stores, specialty retailers, mass channel retailers, franchised or other brand-dedicated stores, and shop-in-shops.\nWe may be unable to maintain or increase sales of our products through these distribution channels for several reasons, including the following:\n\u2022the retailers in these channels maintain- and seek to grow- substantial private-label and exclusive offerings as they strive to differentiate the brands and products they offer from those of their competitors;\n\u2022the retailers change their apparel strategies in a way that shifts focus away from our typical consumer or that otherwise results in a reduction of sales of our products generally, such as a reduction of fixture spaces devoted to our products or a shift to other brands;\n\u2022other channels, including vertically-integrated specialty stores and e-commerce sites, account for a substantial portion of jeanswear and casual wear sales. In some of our mature markets, these stores and sites have placed competitive pressure on our primary distribution channels, and many of these stores and sites are now looking to our developing markets to grow their business; and\n\u2022shrinking points of distribution, including fewer doors at our customer locations, store closures and decreased foot traffic due to the COVID-19 pandemic, or bankruptcy or financial difficulties of a customer.\nFurther success by retailer private-labels, vertically-integrated specialty stores and e-commerce sites may continue to adversely affect the sales of our products across all channels, as well as the profitability of our brand-dedicated stores. Additionally, our ability to secure or maintain retail floor space, product display prominence, market share and sales in these channels depends on our ability to offer differentiated products, to increase retailer profitability on our products and the strength of our brands, and such efforts could have an adverse impact on our margins.\nIn addition, the retail industry in the United States has experienced substantial consolidation over the last decade, and further consolidation may occur. Consolidation in the retail industry has typically resulted in store closures, centralized purchasing decisions and increased emphasis by retailers on inventory management and productivity, which could result in fewer stores carrying our products or reduced demand by retailers for our products. In addition, we and other suppliers may experience increased customer leverage over us and greater exposure to credit risk as a result of industry consolidation. Furthermore, consolidation may be partly due to consumers continuing to transition away from traditional wholesale retailers to large online retailers, which in turn exposes our products to increased competition. Any of the foregoing results can impact, and have adversely impacted in the past, our net revenues, margins and ability to operate efficiently.\nWe are a global company with significant revenues and earnings generated internationally, which exposes us to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, as well as political and economic risks.\nA significant portion of our revenues and earnings are generated internationally. In addition, a substantial amount of our products comes from sources outside the country of distribution. As a result, we are both directly and indirectly (through our suppliers) subject to the risks of doing business outside the United States, including:\n\u2022currency fluctuations, which have impacted our results of operations significantly in recent years;\n\u2022political, economic and social instability;\n\u2022changes in tariffs and taxes;\n\u2022regulatory restrictions on our ability to operate in our preferred manner;\n\u2022rapidly changing regulatory restrictions and requirements, for example in the area of data privacy; and\n\u2022less protective foreign laws relating to intellectual property.\nThe functional currency for most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the results of our operations and the value of our foreign assets and liabilities, including debt, which in turn may adversely affect results of operations and cash flows and the comparability of period-to-period results of operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we and foreign competitors sell products in the same market. Foreign governmental policies and actions regarding currency valuation could result in actions by the United States and other countries to offset the effects of such fluctuations. Given the unpredictability and volatility of foreign currency exchange rates, ongoing or unusual volatility may adversely impact our business and financial conditions.\nFurthermore, due to our global operations, we are subject to numerous domestic and foreign laws and regulations affecting our business, such as those related to labor, employment, worker health and safety, antitrust and competition, environmental protection, consumer protection, privacy, and anti-corruption, including but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") and the U.K. Bribery Act. Although we have put into place policies and procedures aimed at ensuring legal and regulatory compliance, our employees, subcontractors and agents could take actions that violate these requirements. Violations of these regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe also are subject to the impacts of political, economic and social instability. For example, in January 2020, the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. The consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal and related changes to trade and tax policy could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence, and the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and retail products, including our products. Any of these effects, among others, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Brexit has also contributed to volatility and uncertainty in global stock markets and currency exchange rates, and such volatility could continue to occur.\nChanges to trade policy, including tariff and customs regulations, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business, as well as any negative sentiment toward the United States as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business. For example, the Trump Administration instituted and proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on U.S. imports, economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries where we conduct our business. It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes.\nAs a result of recent policy changes and proposals, there may be greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade. New tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries. Like many other multinational corporations, we do a significant amount of business that could be impacted by changes to U.S. and international trade policies (including governmental action related to tariffs, sanctions and trade agreements). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the global demand for our products and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe enactment of tax reform legislation, including legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities, could adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.\nLegislation or other changes in US and international tax laws could increase our liability and adversely affect our after-tax profitability. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") was enacted in the United States on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act had a significant impact on our effective tax rate, cash tax expenses and net deferred tax assets. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate, eliminated or limited the deduction of several expenses that were previously deductible, imposed a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed historic earnings of foreign subsidiaries, requires a minimum tax on earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries and permits a tax-free repatriation of foreign earnings through a dividends received deduction. We completed our evaluation of the overall impact of the Tax Act on our effective tax rate and balance sheet through the fiscal year 2018 and reflected the amounts in our financial statements. The Tax Act, as well as regulations and legal decisions interpreting and applying the Tax Act, may have significant impacts in future periods.\nIf we encounter problems with distribution, our ability to deliver our products to market could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on both company-owned and third-party distribution facilities to warehouse and ship products to our wholesale customers, retail stores and e-commerce consumers throughout the world. As part of the pursuit for improved organizational agility and marketplace responsiveness, we have consolidated the number of distribution facilities we rely upon and continue to look for opportunities for further consolidation in certain regions. Such consolidation may make our operations more vulnerable to interruptions in the event of work stoppages or disruption (including as a consequence of public health directives, quarantine policies or social distancing measures imposed by governments), labor disputes, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), the impacts of climate change, earthquakes, floods, fires or other natural disasters affecting these distribution centers. In addition, distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the transportation of products to and from their distribution facilities, which also may be adversely affected by work stoppages or disruption, labor disputes and pandemics. Moreover, our distribution system includes computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks related to data and system security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. If we encounter problems with our distribution system, whether company-owned or third-party, our ability to meet customer and consumer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be adversely affected.\nUnexpected obstacles in new markets in our existing markets may limit our expansion opportunities and cause our business and growth to suffer.\nOur future growth depends in part on our continued expansion efforts in existing markets and in new markets where we may have limited familiarity and experience with regulatory environments and market practices. In particular, one of our key strategies is to further diversify our portfolio and grow market share across geographies, categories, genders and channels. We may not be able to expand or successfully operate in those markets, categories and channels as a result of unfamiliarity or other unexpected barriers to expansion or entry. For example, in connection with our efforts, we may encounter obstacles, including new competitors, cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor practices and market practices, economic or governmental instability, difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments and differences in consumer tastes and preferences. Our failure to develop our business in new markets or disappointing growth in existing markets that we may experience could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe face risks arising from restructuring of our operations and uncertainty with respect to our ability to achieve any anticipated cost savings associated with such restructuring.\nWe continuously assess opportunities to streamline operations and fuel long-term profitable growth. Future charges related to such actions may harm our profitability in the periods incurred.\nIn July 2020, we announced a plan to implement a reduction in workforce in response to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2020, we announced the next step of our restructuring initiative, which included realignment of our top level organization to support our new strategies, which became effective in 2021. The next phase of the reorganization, including the streamlining of operations, is expected to be completed in 2021. The initiative included the elimination of approximately 15% of our global non-retail and non-manufacturing employee population.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur charges related to this reduction in workforce during the next 12 months, which may harm our profitability in the periods incurred.\nImplementation of this reduction in workforce, or any similar future restructuring program actions, presents a number of significant risks, including:\n\u2022actual or perceived disruption of service or reduction in service levels to customers and consumers;\n\u2022potential adverse effects on our internal control environment and inability to preserve adequate internal controls relating to our general and administrative functions in connection with the decision to outsource certain business service activities;\n\u2022actual or perceived disruption to suppliers, distribution networks and other important operational relationships and the inability to resolve potential conflicts in a timely manner;\n\u2022difficulty in obtaining timely delivery of products of acceptable quality from our contract manufacturers;\n\u2022diversion of management attention from ongoing business activities and strategic objectives; and\n\u2022failure to maintain employee morale and retain key employees.\nBecause of these and other factors, we cannot predict whether we will fully realize the purpose and anticipated operational benefits or cost savings of any global productivity actions and, if we do not, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. Additionally, there may be a failure to achieve the anticipated levels of cost savings and efficiency as a result of the reduction in workforce, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. Furthermore, additional restructuring or reorganization activities may be required in the future.\nAny major disruption or failure of our information technology systems, or our failure to successfully implement new technology effectively, could adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe rely on various information technology systems, owned by us and third parties, to manage our operations. Over the last several years, we have been and continue to implement modifications and upgrades to our systems, including making changes to legacy systems, replacing legacy systems with successor systems with new functionality and acquiring new systems with new functionality. For example, over the next several years, we plan to continue the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning system across the company. These activities subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with replacing and upgrading these systems, including impairment of our ability to fulfill customer orders, potential disruption of our internal control structure, substantial capital expenditures, additional administration and operating expenses, retention of sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the new systems, demands on management time, and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new or upgraded systems or of integrating new or upgraded systems into our current systems. Our system implementations may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation, or at all. In addition, the difficulties with implementing new or upgraded technology systems may cause disruptions in our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business and operations, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated.\nAs we outsource functions, we become more dependent on the entities performing those functions. Disruptions or delays at our third-party service providers could adversely impact our operations.\nAs part of our long-term profitable growth strategy, we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more cost-effective manner. In some cases, this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers. For example, we currently outsource a significant portion of our information technology, finance, customer relations and customer service functions to Wipro Limited. While we believe we conduct appropriate diligence before entering into agreements with any outsourcing entity, the failure of one or more of such entities to meet our performance standards and expectations, including with respect to data security, compliance with data protection and privacy laws, providing services on a timely basis or providing services at the prices we expect, may have an\nadverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. For example, our outsourcing entities and other third-party service providers may experience difficulties, disruptions, delays, or failures in their ability to deliver services to us as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We could face increased costs or disruption associated with finding replacement vendors or hiring new employees in order to return these services in-house, which may have a significant impact on the cost and timing of receipt of inventory for future seasons. We may outsource other functions in the future, which would increase our reliance on third parties.\nWe face cybersecurity, privacy and data protection risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.\nWe utilize systems that allow for the secure storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our consumers, employees, and others, including credit card information and personal information. To protect our employees and consumers through the COVID-19 pandemic we may process and make decisions based on individuals\u2019 personal health information, such as whether to close facilities, perform cleaning, or engage in contact tracing, even though the medical guidance on symptoms and disease prevention is not static. As evidenced by the numerous companies who have suffered serious data security breaches, we may be vulnerable to, and unable to anticipate or detect, data security breaches and data loss, including rapidly evolving and increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity attacks. In addition, data security breaches can also occur as a result of a failure by us or our employees, such as failing to follow policies, procedures or training, or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. In addition to our own databases, we use third-party service providers to store, process and transmit confidential or personal information on our behalf. Although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures and to comply with laws relating to privacy and data protection, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a data security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems.\nA data security breach may expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, and could result in significant costs to us, which may include, among others, potential liabilities to payment card networks for reimbursement of credit card fraud and card reissuance costs, including fines and penalties, potential liabilities from governmental or third-party investigations, proceedings or litigation and diversion of management attention and also further inquiries and increased scrutiny from regulatory entities. We could also experience delays or interruptions in our ability to function in the normal course of business, including delays in the fulfillment or cancellation of customer orders or disruptions in the manufacture and shipment of products. In addition, actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Any compromise or breach of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation, and a loss of consumer trust.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. In the United States, various laws and regulations apply to the collection, processing, disclosure and security of certain types of data, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act and state laws relating to privacy and data security, including the California Consumer Privacy Act. Several foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union, also have laws and regulations dealing with the handling and processing of personal information obtained from their residents, which in certain cases are more restrictive than those in the United States. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of various types of data referred to as personal information. The definition of personal information, which includes data that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, directly or indirectly, such as names or email addresses and, in some jurisdictions, any unique identifier such as an internet protocol addresses, has been continually revised in a way that puts larger amounts of information within scope of the laws. Such laws and regulations may be modified or subject to new or different interpretations, and new laws and regulations may be enacted in the future. Within the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018 and replaced the 1995 European Union Data Protection Directive and superseded applicable European Union member state legislation, imposes significant new requirements on how companies collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for noncompliance. The increased complexity in these laws and the inherent conflicts between jurisdictions may result in an inability for the company to comply with all applicable requirements in the jurisdictions where we do business despite our best efforts.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with laws, regulations, policies or regulatory guidance relating to privacy or data security may result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, and could cause our customers and consumers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Our efforts to implement evolving global detailed legal requirements relating to protection of personal information creates uncertainty in our ability to anticipate the volume of consumer inquiries, to timely respond, and to predict\nconsumer understanding of our business practices which may all unintentionally create confusion about our practices and cause loss of trust and damage to our reputation.\nWe currently rely on contract manufacturing of our products. Our inability to secure production sources meeting our quality, cost, social and environmental risk mitigation and other requirements, or failures by our contract manufacturers to perform, could harm our sales, service levels and reputation.\nIn fiscal year 2020, we sourced approximately 99% of our products from independent contract manufacturers that purchase fabric and make our products and may also provide us with design and development services. As a result, we must locate and secure production capacity. We depend on contract manufacturers to maintain adequate financial resources, including access to sufficient credit, to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials, and maintain sufficient development and manufacturing capacity in an environment characterized by continuing cost pressure and demands for product innovation and speed-to-market. In addition, we currently do not have any material long-term contracts with any of our contract manufacturers. Under our current arrangements with our contract manufacturers, these manufacturers generally may unilaterally terminate their relationship with us at any time. While we have historically worked with numerous manufacturers, in recent years we have begun consolidating the number of contract manufacturers from which we source our products. In addition, some of our contract manufacturers have merged. Reliance on a fewer number of contract manufacturers involves risk, and any difficulties or failures to perform by our contract manufacturers could cause delays in product shipments or otherwise negatively affect our results of operations. If our contract manufacturers, or any raw material vendors or suppliers on which our contract manufacturers rely, suffer prolonged manufacturing or transportation disruptions due to public health conditions, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, or other unforeseen events, our ability to source product on a timely basis could be adversely impacted, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Also, we have certain minimum inventory purchase commitments, including fabric commitments, with suppliers that secure a portion of material needs for future seasons. If we do not satisfy the minimum purchase commitments, due to conditions such as decreased demand, we will be charged for estimated adverse purchase commitments.\nA contract manufacturer's failure to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet our quality standards, or interference with our ability to receive shipments due to factors such as port or transportation conditions or security incidents, could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers. Failing to make timely deliveries may cause our customers to cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries, impose non-compliance charges, demand reduced prices, or reduce future orders, any of which could harm our sales and margins. If we need to replace any contract manufacturer, we may be unable to locate additional contract manufacturers on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or we may be unable to locate additional contract manufacturers with sufficient capacity to meet our requirements or to fill our orders in a timely manner.\nWe require contract manufacturers to make progress toward our sustainability goals and meet our standards and policies in terms of working conditions, environmental protection, raw materials, facility safety, security and other matters before we are willing to place business with them. As such, we may not be able to obtain the lowest-cost production. We also may need to move our production to the extent that we determine our contract manufacturers are not in compliance with our standards or applicable government standards, sanctions or other restrictions. We may also encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our contract manufacturers in our methods, products and quality control standards. In addition, the labor and business practices of apparel manufacturers and their suppliers, including raw material suppliers, have received increased attention from the media, non-governmental organizations, consumers and governmental agencies in recent years. Any failure by our contract manufacturers or their suppliers to adhere to labor or other laws, appropriate labor or business practices, safety, structural or environmental standards, and the potential litigation, negative publicity and political pressure relating to any of these events, could harm our business and reputation.\nOur suppliers may be impacted by economic conditions and cycles and changing laws and regulatory requirements which could impact their ability to do business with us or cause us to terminate our relationship with them and require us to find replacements, which we may have difficulty doing.\nOur suppliers are subject to the fluctuations in general economic cycles, and global economic conditions may impact their ability to operate their businesses. They may also be impacted by the increasing costs or availability of raw materials, labor and distribution, resulting in demands for less attractive contract terms or an inability for them to meet our requirements or conduct their own businesses. The performance and financial condition of a supplier may cause us to alter our business terms or to cease doing business with a particular supplier, or change our sourcing practices generally, which could in turn adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, regulatory developments such as reporting requirements on the use of \"conflict\" minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, or compliance with the recent sanctions and customs trade orders issued by the U.S. government related to entities and individuals who are connected to the Xinjiang region of China, could affect the sourcing and availability of raw materials used by our suppliers in the manufacturing of certain of our products. We have been and may continue to be subject to costs associated with regulations, including for the diligence pertaining to these\nmatters and the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. The impact of such regulations may result in a limited pool of acceptable suppliers, and we cannot be assured that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, because our supply chain is complex, we may face regulatory challenges in complying with applicable sanctions and trade regulations and reputational challenges with our consumers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the material used in the products we sell.\nIf one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us, we may incur significant losses.\nAs part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, which may include forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps, with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. We also have entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as defined below) with several financial institutions that provides us with additional credit availability. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. This risk may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty\u2019s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe loss of members of our executive management and other key employees or the failure to attract and retain key personnel could harm our business.\nOur future success depends, in part, on the continued service of our executive management team and other key employees, and the loss of the services of any key individual could harm our business. Our future success also depends, in part, on our ability to recruit, retain and motivate our employees sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for experienced and well-qualified employees in our industry is particularly intense in many of the places where we do business, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Moreover, shifts in U.S. immigration policy could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain highly skilled employees who are from outside the United States.\nMost of the employees in our production and distribution facilities are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and any material job actions could negatively affect our results of operations.\nIn North America, most of our distribution employees are covered by various collective bargaining agreements. Outside North America, most of our production and distribution employees are covered by either industry-sponsored and/or government-sponsored collective bargaining mechanisms. Any work stoppages or other job actions by these employees could harm our business and reputation.\nOur licensees and franchisees may not comply with our product quality, manufacturing standards, social, environmental, marketing and other requirements, which could negatively affect our reputation and business.\nWe license our trademarks to third parties for manufacturing, marketing and distribution of various products. While we enter into comprehensive agreements with our licensees covering product design, product quality, sourcing, manufacturing, marketing and other requirements, our licensees may not comply fully with those agreements. Non-compliance could include marketing products under our brand names that do not meet our quality and other requirements or engaging in manufacturing practices that do not meet our sustainability standards and policies including our supplier code of conduct or applicable government restrictions and regulations. These activities could harm our brand equity, our reputation and our business.\nIn addition, we enter into franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate stores and, in certain circumstances, websites, in many countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores and websites that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. While the agreements we have entered into and plan to enter into in the future provide us with certain termination rights, the value of our brands could be impaired to the extent that these third parties do not operate their businesses, including their stores or websites in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.\nOur success depends on the continued protection of our trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property rights.\nOur trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and competitive position, and the loss of or inability to enforce trademark and other proprietary intellectual property rights could harm our business. We devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademark and other proprietary intellectual property rights on a global basis. In addition to our trademarks and other intellectual property rights, as we develop technologies that we believe are innovative, such as our F.L.X. technology, we intend to continually assess the patentability and other protectability of new intellectual property. However, the patents that we own and those that may be issued in the future may not adequately protect our intellectual property, survive legal challenges or provide us with competitive advantages, and our patent applications may not be granted. Our efforts to establish and protect our proprietary intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to claim ownership or seeking to block sales of our products. Unauthorized copying of our products or unauthorized use of our trademarks, patented technologies or other proprietary rights may not only erode sales of our products but may also cause significant reputational harm to our brand names and our ability to effectively represent ourselves to our consumers, contractors, suppliers and/or licensees. Moreover, others may seek to assert rights in, or ownership of, our trademarks and other intellectual property, including through civil and/or criminal prosecution. We may not be able to successfully resolve those claims, which may result in financial liability and criminal penalties, and defending or pursuing such claims may create significant financial burdens. In addition, the laws and enforcement mechanisms of some foreign countries may not allow us to protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as we are able to in the United States and other countries.\nWe have substantial liabilities and cash requirements associated with our postretirement benefits, pension and deferred compensation plans.\nOur postretirement benefits, pension and deferred compensation plans result in substantial liabilities on our balance sheet. These plans and activities have generated, and will generate, substantial cash requirements for us, and these requirements may increase beyond our expectations in future years based on changing market conditions. The difference between plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the plans, is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans. Many variables, such as changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, investment returns and/or the market value of plan assets, can affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. Plan liabilities may impair our liquidity, have an unfavorable impact on our ability to obtain financing and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors who do not have such liabilities and cash requirements.\nNatural disasters, public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, political crises, and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may damage our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend, and could impact consumer spending.\nOur global headquarters and the headquarters of our Americas region are both located in California near major geologic faults that have experienced earthquakes in the past. An earthquake or other natural disaster or power shortages or outages could disrupt operations or impair critical systems. Any of these disruptions or other events outside of our control could affect our business negatively, harming our operating results. In addition, if any of our facilities, including our manufacturing, finishing or distribution facilities, our company-operated or franchised stores or the facilities of our suppliers, third-party service providers, or customers, is affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, power shortages or outages, floods or monsoons, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics (including, for example, the COVID-19 pandemic), political crises, such as terrorism, war, political instability, social unrest, or other conflict; industrial accidents, such as structural integrity failure or fire; or other events outside of our control, our business and operating results could suffer. Disasters occurring at our or our vendors\u2019 facilities also could impact our reputation and our consumers\u2019 perception of our brands. Moreover, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or, depending upon the severity, globally, which could adversely impact our operating results. Any disruptions in our operations could negatively impact our business and operating results, and harm our reputation. In addition, we may not carry business insurance or may not carry sufficient business insurance to compensate for losses that may occur. Any such losses or damages could have a adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws in various jurisdictions around the world. The FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar applicable laws generally prohibit companies, as well as their officers, directors, employees and third-party intermediaries, business partners and agents, from making improper payments or providing other improper things of value to government officials or other persons. We and our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state\nowned or affiliated entities and other third parties where we may be held liable for corrupt or other illegal activities, even if we do not explicitly authorize them. While we have policies and procedures and internal controls to address compliance with such laws, we cannot provide assurance that all of our employees and third-party intermediaries, business partners and agents will not take actions in violation of such policies and laws, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. To the extent that we learn that any of our employees or third-party intermediaries, business partners or agents do not adhere to our policies, procedures or internal controls, we are committed to taking appropriate remedial action. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our directors, officers, employees or third-party intermediaries, agents or business partners have or may have violated such laws, we may be required to investigate or to have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances. Detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations can be extensive and require a significant diversion of time, resources and attention from senior management. Any violation of the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, and criminal or civil sanctions, penalties and fines, any of which may could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur current and future products may experience quality problems from time to time that could result in negative publicity, litigation, product recalls and warranty claims, which could result in decreased revenues and harm to our brands.\nThere can be no assurance we will be able to detect, prevent or fix all defects that may affect our products. Inconsistency of legislation and regulations may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Such problems could hurt the image of our brands, which is critical to maintaining and expanding our business. Any negative publicity or lawsuits filed against us related to the perceived quality of our products could harm our brand and decrease demand for our products.\nClimate change may adversely impact our business.\nRising global average temperatures due to increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are causing significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Changes in weather patterns and the increased frequency, intensity and duration of extreme weather events (e.g., floods, droughts and severe storms) could, among other things, adversely impact the cultivation of cotton, which is a key resource in the production of our products, disrupt the operation of our supply chain and the productivity of our contract manufacturers, disrupt retail operations and foot traffic in consumer markets, increase our product costs and impact the types of apparel products that consumers purchase. As a result, the effects of climate change could have short- and long-term impacts on our business and operations.\nFuture acquisitions of and investments in new businesses could impact our business and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we may acquire or invest in businesses or partnerships that we believe could complement our business or offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of such acquisitions or investments may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses, regardless of whether the acquisition or investment is ultimately completed. In addition, acquisitions and investments may not perform as expected or cause us to assume unrecognized or underestimated liabilities. Further, if we are able to successfully identify and acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired personnel or operations, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition, any of which could harm our business and financial condition.\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results.\nWe experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in our third and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in our first and second fiscal quarters. In addition, our customers and consumers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. This seasonality, along with other factors that are beyond our control, including the COVID-19 pandemic, general economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, weather conditions, including the effects of climate change, the availability of import quotas, transportation disruptions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate.\nWe are subject to periodic claims and litigation that could result in unexpected expenses and could ultimately be resolved against us.\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in litigation and other proceedings, including matters related to commercial disputes, product liability, intellectual property, trade, customs laws and regulations, employment, regulatory compliance and other claims related to our business. Any such proceeding or audit could result in significant settlement amounts, damages, fines or other penalties, divert financial and management resources and result in significant legal fees. An unfavorable outcome of any particular proceeding could exceed the limits of our insurance policies, or our insurance carriers may decline to fund such final settlements or judgments, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any such proceeding could negatively impact our brand equity and our reputation.\nRisks Relating to Our Debt\nWe have debt and interest payment requirements at a level that may restrict our future operations.\nAs of November 29, 2020, we had $1.6 billion of debt, all of which was unsecured, and we had $713.5 million of additional borrowing capacity under our credit facility. The credit facility is secured by domestic inventories, accounts receivable, and other assets such as the Levi\u2019s\u00ae trademarks in the U.S. Our debt requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which reduces funds available for other business purposes and results in us having lower net income (or greater net loss) than we otherwise would have had. This dedicated use of cash could impact our ability to successfully compete by, for example:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including any adverse economic and industry conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, such as store closures, decreased foot traffic and recession;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing required to fund working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes.\nA substantial portion of our debt is Euro-denominated senior notes. In addition, borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at variable rates and a portion of those borrowings may be in Canadian Dollars. As a result, increases in market interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates could require a greater portion of our cash flow to be used to pay interest, which could further hinder our operations. Increases in market interest rates may also affect the trading price of our debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate. Our ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, certain loans made by us and financing extended to us are made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate, and may be hedged with LIBOR-based interest rate derivatives. Regulators and law-enforcement agencies in a number of different jurisdictions have conducted and continue to conduct civil and criminal investigations into potential manipulation or attempted manipulation of LIBOR submissions by panel banks. LIBOR is currently calculated and published for various currencies and periods by the benchmark\u2019s administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (\u201cIBA\u201d), which is regulated for such purposes by the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d). The FCA has statutory powers to compel panel banks to provide rate quotations for the purpose of calculating LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the FCA gave a speech in which he questioned the sustainability of LIBOR and announced that the FCA would no longer require banks to submit quotations on which LIBOR rates are based after the end of 2021. However, on November 30, 2020, the IBA announced that it would consult in early December 2020 on its intention to cease the publication of the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings (overnight and one, three, six and 12 months) immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. IBA published this consultation on December 4, 2020 and expects to close the consultation for feedback on January 25, 2021. Concurrent with IBA\u2019s announcement on November 30, 2020, the FCA announced that it welcomed and supported the prospective continuation of most settings of LIBOR beyond the end of 2021, as proposed by the IBA.\nAccordingly, many market participants anticipate that in the near future LIBOR will cease being a widely used benchmark interest rate and may cease being published altogether. The current and any future reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to be replaced with a new benchmark or to perform differently than in the past, including during any transition period. The Credit Agreement Amendment (defined below) contemplates a procedure for transitioning from LIBOR upon the occurrence of specified events. Nevertheless, the consequences of these market developments cannot be entirely predicted and a transition from LIBOR, even if administered consistent with the credit facility\u2019s provisions, could increase the cost of our variable rate indebtedness.\nBoth New York State and federal legislation in the U.S. is under consideration that if enacted could result, upon the unavailability of LIBOR, in the replacement of certain fallback provisions in LIBOR-based financing agreements. Under the proposed legislation, some of these existing fallback provisions would be replaced by a provision specifying that the replacement rate and related adjustments recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d), the committee in the United States convened to ensure a successful transition from LIBOR, would be used to establish the interest-rate on the financing. The legislation would also require the use of the benchmark replacement rate and related adjustments recommended by the AARC in the event that there are no fallback provisions in a financing. The legislation would not impact credit agreements that already include fallbacks to the changes recommended by the ARRC. Any such legislation adopted in\nNew York State would have applicability only to agreements governed by New York law. There can be no assurance as to the final form of any such New York or federal legislation or as to whether any such legislation will be adopted.\nIn the event that one or more LIBOR-based interest rate derivatives are entered into to hedge variable rate indebtedness, the LIBOR rate specified therein will be determined from time to time by reference to a publication page specified in the relevant definitions of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (\u201cISDA\u201d). However, if such rate does not appear on the relevant page, and the above-referenced legislation is not adopted that would address the replacement of LIBOR under such derivatives, LIBOR will be determined in accordance with dealer polls conducted by the calculation agent under the agreement governing the derivative. This dealer polling mechanism may not be successful in arriving at a replacement interest rate for LIBOR. Even if the dealer polling mechanism successfully arrives at a replacement interest rate for derivatives, that rate could differ significantly from the interest rates used for our variable-rate indebtedness.\nThe Tax Act also places limitations on businesses' abilities to deduct interest expenses. If our adjusted taxable income were to change, we may not be able to fully deduct our interest expenses.\nRestrictions in our notes, indentures and credit facility may limit our activities, including dividend payments, share repurchases and acquisitions.\nOur credit facility and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes contain restrictions, including covenants limiting our ability to incur additional debt, grant liens, make acquisitions and other investments, prepay specified debt, consolidate, merge or acquire other businesses or engage in other fundamental changes, sell assets, pay dividends and other distributions, repurchase stock, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into capital leases or certain leases not in the ordinary course of business, enter into certain derivatives, grant negative pledges on our assets, make loans or other investments, guarantee third-party obligations, engage in sale leasebacks and make changes in our corporate structure. These restrictions, in combination with our leveraged condition, may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy, grow our business or compete with companies not similarly restricted.\nIf our foreign subsidiaries are unable to distribute cash to us when needed, we may be unable to satisfy our obligations under our debt securities, which could force us to sell assets or use cash that we were planning to use elsewhere in our business.\nWe conduct our international operations through foreign subsidiaries and we only receive the cash that remains after our foreign subsidiaries satisfy their obligations. We may depend upon funds from our foreign subsidiaries for a portion of the funds necessary to meet our debt service obligations. Any agreements our foreign subsidiaries enter into with other parties, as well as applicable laws and regulations limiting the right and ability of non-U.S. subsidiaries and affiliates to pay dividends and remit cash to affiliated companies, may restrict the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. If those subsidiaries are unable to transfer the amount of cash that we need, we may be unable to make payments on our debt obligations, which could force us to sell assets or use cash that we were planning on using elsewhere in our business, which could hinder our operations.\nChanges in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity, increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options.\nOur long-term debt is currently rated BB+ by S&P Global Ratings, Ba1 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc and BB by Fitch Ratings, Inc. If our credit ratings are lowered, borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term credit facilities may increase and our financing options, including our access to the unsecured credit market, could be limited. In addition, macroeconomic conditions such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, including the recent volatility due, in part, to the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing or refinance existing debt on terms that would be acceptable to us.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nOur revenues are influenced by economic conditions that impact consumer spending and consumer confidence.\nApparel is a cyclical industry that is dependent upon the overall level of consumer spending and consumer confidence. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our products, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected, there is economic uncertainty or volatility or during recessionary periods. Our wholesale customers anticipate and respond to adverse changes in economic conditions and uncertainty by closing doors, reducing inventories, canceling orders or increasing promotional activity. Our brand-dedicated stores are also affected by these conditions, which may lead to a decline in consumer traffic and spending in these stores. As a result, factors that diminish consumer spending and confidence in any of the markets in which we compete, particularly deterioration in general economic conditions, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, inflation, the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on tourism and tourist spending, volatility in investment returns, fear of unemployment, increases in energy costs or tax or interest rates, housing market\ndownturns, fear about and impact of pandemic illness, (such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced store traffic and widespread temporary store closures), and other factors such as acts of war, natural disasters or terrorist or political events that impact consumer confidence, could reduce our sales and adversely affect our business and financial condition through their impact on our wholesale customers as well as direct sales.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, related restrictions on travel and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending, and the extent of any recession resulting from the pandemic, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. For example, as the number of people affected by the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow, consumer fear about becoming ill with the disease and recommendations and/or mandates from federal, state and local authorities to avoid large gatherings of people or self-quarantine may continue to increase, which will adversely affect traffic to our and our customer's stores. Any significant reduction in customer visits to, and spending at, our and our customer's stores caused by COVID-19 would result in a loss of sales and profits and other adverse effects. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption could adversely affect our business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition.\nIntense competition in the global apparel industry could lead to reduced sales and prices.\nWe face a variety of competitive challenges in the global apparel industry from a variety of companies, and competition has increased over the years due to factors such as:\n\u2022the international expansion and increased presence of vertically integrated specialty stores;\n\u2022expansion into e-commerce by existing and new competitors;\n\u2022the proliferation of private labels and exclusive brands offered by department stores, chain stores and mass channel retailers;\n\u2022the introduction of lines of jeans, athleisure and casual apparel by well-known and successful athletic wear companies; and\n\u2022the transition of apparel companies who traditionally relied on wholesale distribution channels into their own retail distribution network.\nIn addition, some of these competitors have greater financial, supply, distribution and marketing resources and may be able to adapt to changes in consumer preferences or retail requirements more quickly or devote greater resources to the building and sustaining of their brand equity and the marketing and sale of their products both in stores and online. In addition, some of these competitors may be able to achieve lower product costs or adopt more aggressive pricing and discounting policies. As a result, we may not be able to compete as effectively with them and may not be able to maintain or grow the demand for our products. Failure to compete effectively due to these factors could reduce our sales and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe success of our business depends upon our ability to forecast and respond timely to consumer demand and market conditions and offer on-trend and new and updated products at attractive price points.\nThe global apparel industry is characterized by ever-changing fashion trends and consumer preferences, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement and social media communication, and by the rapid replication of new products by competitors. The apparel industry is also impacted by changing consumer preferences regarding spending categories generally, including shifts away from traditional consumer spending and towards \"experiential\" spending and sustainable products. As a result, our success depends in large part on our ability to develop, market and deliver innovative and stylish products at a pace, intensity and price competitive with other brands in the markets in which we sell our products. In addition, we must create products at a range of price points that appeal to the consumers of both our wholesale customers and our dedicated retail stores and e-commerce sites situated in each of our diverse geographic regions. Our development and production cycles take place prior to full visibility into all of these factors for the coming seasons. Failure on our part to forecast and respond timely to consumer demand and market conditions and to regularly and rapidly develop innovative and stylish products and update core products could limit sales growth, adversely affect retail and consumer acceptance of our products and negatively impact the consumer traffic in our dedicated retail stores. In addition, if we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels, which may result in inventory write-downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices. This could have an adverse effect on the image and reputation of our brands and could adversely affect our gross margins. For example, if sales do not meet expectations because of unexpected effects on inventory supply and consumer demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower-than-planned margins. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products, we may experience inventory shortages,\nwhich could delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer and consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty. Moreover, our newer products may not produce as high a gross margin as our traditional products and thus may have an adverse effect on our overall margins and profitability.\nThe global apparel industry is subject to intense cost and pricing pressure.\nThe apparel industry is characterized by low barriers to entry for both suppliers and marketers, global sourcing through suppliers located throughout the world, trade liberalization, continuing movement of product sourcing to lower cost countries, regular promotional activity, and the ongoing emergence of new competitors with widely varying strategies and resources. These factors have contributed, and may continue to contribute in the future, to intense pricing pressure and uncertainty throughout the supply chain. Pricing pressure has been exacerbated by the variability of raw materials in recent years. This pressure could have adverse effects on our business and financial condition, including:\n\u2022reduced gross margins across our product lines and distribution channels;\n\u2022increased retailer demands for allowances, incentives and other forms of economic support; and\n\u2022increased pressure on us to reduce our production costs and operating expenses.\nIncreases in the price or availability of raw materials could increase our cost of goods and negatively impact our financial results.\nThe principal fabrics used in our products include cotton, blends, synthetics and wools. The prices we pay our suppliers for our products are dependent in part on the market price for raw materials used to produce them, primarily cotton. The price and availability of cotton may fluctuate substantially, depending on a variety of factors, including demand, acreage devoted to cotton crops and crop yields, weather, supply conditions, transportation costs, energy prices, work stoppages, government regulation, sanctions and policy, economic climates, market speculation compliance with our working condition, environmental protection, and other standards, and other unpredictable factors. For example, compliance with the recent sanctions and trade orders issued by the U.S. government related to entities and individuals who are connected to the Xinjiang region of China could affect the sourcing and availability of raw materials, including cotton, used by our suppliers in the manufacturing of certain of our products. Any and all of these factors may be exacerbated by global climate change. Cotton prices suffered from unprecedented variability and uncertainty in prior years and may fluctuate significantly again in the future. In the event of a significant disruption or unavailability in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. In addition, prices of purchased finished products also depend on wage rates in the regions where our contract manufacturers are located, as well as freight costs from those regions. Fluctuations in wage rates required by legal or industry standards could increase our costs. Increases in raw material costs or wage rates, unless sufficiently offset by our pricing actions, may cause a decrease in our profitability and negatively impact our sales volume. These factors may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs as well as those of our suppliers.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing overseas, as well as risks associated with potential tariffs or a global trade war.\nWe import materials and finished garments into all of our operating regions. Our ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes and work stoppages, political unrest, security incidents, severe weather, or security requirements in the United States and other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require us to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to our customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transportation costs, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition, specifically our gross margin and overall profitability.\nSubstantially all of our import operations are subject to complex trade and customs laws, regulations and tax requirements such as sanctions orders or tariffs set by governments through mutual agreements or unilateral actions. In addition, the countries in which our products are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional duties, tariffs or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions. Adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions, or the failure by us or our suppliers to comply with trade regulations or similar laws, could harm our business. In this regard, the increasingly protectionist trade policy in the United States and the Brexit process between the United Kingdom and the European Union have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to future tax and trade regulations.\nChanges in tax policy or trade regulations, the disallowance of tax deductions on imported merchandise, or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn 2018, the Trump Administration announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imported into the United States, which has resulted in reciprocal tariffs from the European Union on goods, including denim products, imported from the United States.\nBecause we manufacture most of our products outside the United States, these reciprocal tariffs are not expected to have a material impact on our business. The Trump Administration also imposed tariffs on goods imported from China in connection with China\u2019s intellectual property practices and forced technology transfer, and has launched an investigation into currency manipulation and timber trade practices that may results in increased tariffs on impacts to the United States from Vietnam. Currently, of the products that we sell in the United States, less than 2% are manufactured in China. If the Office of the US Trade Representative follows through on its proposed China or Vietnam tariffs, or if additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by the United States or other countries in connection with a global trade war, the cost of our products manufactured in China or other countries and imported into the United States or other countries could increase, which in turn could adversely affect the demand for these products and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenues or other operating results;\n\u2022variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;\n\u2022any forward-looking financial or operating information we may provide to the public or securities analysts, any changes in this information or our failure to meet expectations based on this information;\n\u2022actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022whether investors or securities analysts view our stock structure unfavorably, particularly our dual-class structure;\n\u2022additional shares of Class A common stock being sold into the market by us or our existing stockholders, or the anticipation of such sales;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, divestitures or other dispositions;\n\u2022changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of companies in our industry, including our vendors and competitors;\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of general economic trends;\n\u2022lawsuits threatened or filed against us, or events that negatively impact our reputation;\n\u2022developments in new legislation and pending lawsuits or regulatory actions, including interim or final rulings by judicial or regulatory bodies; and\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, industrial accidents, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), or responses to these events.\nIn addition, extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets have affected and continue to affect many retail companies\u2019 stock prices. Often, their stock prices have fluctuated in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the respective companies\u2019 operating performance. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and seriously harm our business.\nMoreover, because of these fluctuations, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our Class A common stock could decline substantially. Such a decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated revenues or earnings forecasts that we may provide.\nAn active trading market for our Class A common stock may not be sustained.\nOur Class A common stock is currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") under the symbol \"LEVI.\" However, we cannot assure you that an active trading market for our Class A common stock will be sustained. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of the likelihood that an active trading market for our Class A common stock will be maintained, the liquidity of any trading market, your ability to sell your shares of Class A common stock when desired or the prices that you may obtain for your shares.\nFuture sales of our Class A common stock by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders, including employees, who obtain equity, sell or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public market, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline. As of January 21, 2021 we had outstanding a total of 77,329,197 shares of Class A common stock and 320,730,620 shares of Class B common stock. Of these shares, only the shares of Class A common stock are currently freely tradable without restrictions or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), except for any shares held by persons who are not our \u201caffiliates\u201d as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act and who have complied with the holding period requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nSales of a substantial number of such shares, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause our stock price to decline or make it more difficult for the holders of our Class A common stock to sell at a time and price that they deem appropriate.\nHolders of more than 90% of our Class B common stock have contractual rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements for the public resale of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of their Class B common stock, or to include such shares in registration statements that we may file.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock concentrates voting control with descendants of the family of Levi Strauss, who have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted for stockholder approval, which will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and may depress the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur Class B common stock, which is entitled to ten votes per share, is primarily owned by descendants of the family of our founder, Levi Strauss, and their relatives and trusts established for their behalf. Collectively, these persons have the ability to control the outcome of stockholder votes, including the election of our board of directors and the approval or rejection of a merger, change of control or other significant corporate transaction. In addition, so long as any shares of Class B common stock remain outstanding, the approval of the holders of a majority of our then-outstanding Class B common stock (or, in certain cases, a majority of our then-outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock, voting together as a single class) will be required in order for us to take certain actions.\nThis control may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain of their indexes. S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell have recently announced changes to their eligibility criteria for inclusion of shares of public companies on certain indices, including the S&P 500. These changes exclude companies with multiple classes of shares of common stock from being added to such indices. In addition, several stockholder advisory firms have announced their opposition to the use of multiple class structures. As a result, the dual class structure of our common stock may prevent the inclusion of our Class A common stock in such indices and may cause stockholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure. Any such exclusion from indices could result in a less active trading market for our Class A common stock. Any actions or publications by stockholder advisory firms critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure could also adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock.\nWe believe having a long-term-focused, committed and engaged stockholder base provides us with an important strategic advantage, particularly in our business, where our more than 165-year history contributes to the iconic reputations of our brands. However, the interests of these stockholders may not always be aligned with each other or with the interests of our other stockholders. By exercising their control, these stockholders could cause our company to take actions that are at odds with the investment goals or interests of institutional, short-term or other non-controlling investors, or that have a negative effect on our stock price. Further, because these stockholders control the majority of our Class B common stock, we might be a less attractive takeover target, which could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts either do not publish research about us or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business or our market, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock, the trading price or trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock is influenced in part by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If one or more of the analysts initiate\nresearch with an unfavorable rating or downgrade our Class A common stock, provide a more favorable recommendation about our competitors or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our Class A common stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the trading price or trading volume of our Class A common stock to decline.\nFuture securities issuances could result in significant dilution to our stockholders and impair the market price of our Class A common stock.\nFuture issuances of our Class A common stock or the conversion of a substantial number of shares of our Class B common stock, or the perception that these issuances or conversions may occur, could depress the market price of our Class A common stock and result in dilution to existing holders of our Class A common stock. Also, to the extent stock-based awards are issued or become vested, there will be further dilution. The amount of dilution could be substantial depending upon the size of the issuances or exercises. Furthermore, we may issue additional equity securities that could have rights senior to those of our Class A common stock. As a result, purchasers of Class A common stock bear the risk that future issuances of debt or equity securities may reduce the value of such shares and further dilute their ownership interest.\nAs of November 29, 2020, there were 6,587,363 shares of Class A common stock and 10,953,272 shares of Class B common stock issuable pursuant to restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), performance restricted stock units (\"PRSUs\") and stock appreciation rights (\"SARs\") that may be settled in shares of our Class A or Class B common stock. All of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise or settlement of such awards, or upon the conversion of shares of Class B common stock issuable upon exercise or settlement of such awards, are registered for public resale under the Securities Act. Accordingly, these shares will be able to be freely sold in the public market upon issuance as permitted by any applicable vesting requirements, and subject to compliance with applicable securities laws.\nHolders of more than 90% of our Class B common stock have contractual rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements for the public resale of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of their Class B common stock, or to include such shares in registration statements that we may file.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, result in more litigation and divert management\u2019s attention.\nAlthough we have made filings with the SEC for many years, as a public company we are subject to the additional reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the NYSE and other applicable securities rules and regulations. For example, we are required to file proxy statements under Section 14 of the Exchange Act. Complying with these rules and regulations has increased and will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We may also need to hire additional employees or engage outside consultants to comply with these requirements, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nThese new rules and regulations may make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and, in the future, we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nBy disclosing information in the various filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If those claims are successful, our business could be seriously harmed. Even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved\nin our favor, the time and resources needed to resolve them could divert our management\u2019s resources and seriously harm our business.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our Class A common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management that our stockholders may deem advantageous. In particular, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws:\n\u2022establish a classified board of directors so that not all members are elected at one time;\n\u2022permit our board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly-created directorships;\n\u2022authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n\u2022provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws;\n\u2022restrict the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware or to Federal court;\n\u2022reflect the dual class structure of our common stock; and\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders.\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of Class A common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws together designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States as the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\n\u2022any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nIn addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.\nThese choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions.", "PERMNO": 18424, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "LEVI"}
