You should carefully consider the following risks, together with the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report.\nThe risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or those we currently deem to be immaterial, may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualification and limitations of forward-looking statements set forth at the beginning of this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe depend on contracts with the U.S. government for substantially all of our revenues. If our relationships with the U.S. government are harmed, our business, future revenues and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe derive the vast majority of our revenues from U.S. government customers, and we anticipate that U.S. government contracts will be the primary source of our revenues for the foreseeable future. Any issue that compromises our relationship with the U.S. government generally, or any U.S. government agency that we serve, could adversely and materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results. Among the key factors in maintaining our relationships with U.S. government agencies are our performance on our contracts and task orders, the strength of our professional reputation, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and the strength of our relationships with our customers and client personnel. To the extent our reputation or relationships with U.S. government agencies is impaired, our revenue and operating profits could materially decline.\nWe may fail to attract and retain skilled and qualified employees with requisite specialized skill sets or security clearances, which could impair our ability to effectively serve our clients, require more subcontracting work than is optimal, impact our profitability and limit our growth prospects.\nOur business depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of employees who have advanced IT and technical services skills. Often, these employees must also have some of the highest security clearances in the United States. Cleared employees are in great demand (particularly as it relates to the limited supply of cleared personnel with certain IT and technical service skills), and we compete intensely for such qualified personnel with other U.S. government contractors, the U.S. government and private industry. The government and industry have recognized that the current process for obtaining security clearances is time-consuming, inefficient and can present a risk to customer mission. While some improvements have been made to the process in the last couple of years, security clearances at the highest levels may still take months or even years to complete. We anticipate that such personnel may remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees or cannot obtain their appropriate security clearances in a timely manner, our ability to serve our clients could be harmed, and we may not be able to grow our business. Additionally, if we cannot hire sufficient qualified employees to staff our contracts, we may be required to engage more contracted personnel, which could reduce our profit margins. Even if we are able to attract the requisite skilled employees, intense competition for such employees may result in attrition in our employee ranks, and we may need to expend additional resources to hire, train and replace such personnel.\nU.S. government spending and mission priorities could change in a manner that adversely affects our future revenues and limits our growth prospects.\nWe depend on continued expenditures by the U.S. government on programs that we support. Spending levels on programs that we support (including those related to intelligence, defense, homeland security, and federal health IT missions) have varied over time, and our customers may reduce expenditures for our services for any number of reasons, to include changing mission priorities, the availability of discretionary spending in light of the country\u2019s growing debt and long-term fiscal challenges, and the implementation of efficiency and cost reduction efforts. A reduction in U.S. government spending levels, or changes in spending priorities, could adversely affect our business and impact our future revenues.\nWe encounter intense competition to win contracts and most of our contracts are awarded through competitive bidding processes; our revenue and profitability may be adversely impacted if we fail to compete effectively for such awards, or if there are delays as a result of our competitors' protests of contract awards that we receive.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, with contract awards typically subject to competitive bidding processes. We may not be able to continue to win competitively awarded contracts at historic levels. We compete with larger companies who have significant financial resources, as well as smaller, more specialized companies that may be able to concentrate their resources into highly-skilled niche markets. Our competitors may be able to provide our customers with more desirable capabilities or better contract terms than we can provide, including price, technical qualifications, past contract experience, geographic presence and the availability of qualified professional personnel.\nOur failure to compete effectively in competitive procurements could adversely impact our future revenues. Participating in the competitive bidding process also involves costs, risks and uncertainties, including the cost, time and effort required to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not ultimately be awarded to us; the need to expend resources or make financial commitments (such as procuring leased premises) in advance of an award decision, or the need to bid on programs prior to the completion of their design, which may result in execution challenges, cost overruns, or in the case of unsuccessful competitions, the loss of committed costs; and the ability to accurately estimate the resources and costs structure required to service any contract we are awarded. The loss of business to our competitors could adversely impact our revenues and, if we are forced to reduce our prices, adversely impact our profitability.\nIn recent years, the competitive environment has also resulted in an increase in bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on contract awards. It can take months to resolve protests by one or more of our competitors relating to contracts that are awarded to us. Even where the protest is unsuccessful and the award to us is upheld, the resulting delay in startup and funding of the work under such contracts may adversely impact our revenues and profitability.\nCyber attacks and other security threats could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide services to our customers; as a leading provider of cyber security services to our customers, any significant cyber incident could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe create, implement and maintain IT and engineering systems, and provide services that are often critical to our customers'\noperations, some of which involve classified or other sensitive information in intelligence, national security and other classified or sensitive customer functions. Our network and systems are subject to continuous exposure to cyber and other security threats, including computer viruses, attacks by individual and state-sponsored computer hackers and physical break-ins. We also face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption due to our custody of classified and other sensitive information. We, like other government contractors, are regularly the target of cyber incidents, and these attempted cyber intrusions are expected to continue to proliferate.\nIf we are unable to protect our network and systems from significant cyber attacks, or if we are unable to detect intrusion attempts or other cyber incidents quickly and remediate those incidents successfully, we may experience one or more of the following adverse effects:\n\u2022\nloss of revenue due to adverse customer reaction;\n\u2022\nexposure to claims for damages, or the incurrence of significant costs related to upgrading systems, networks and our cyber security program generally;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue due to the redeployment of staff for remediation efforts instead of work on billable contracts;\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation, which could adversely impact our ability to attract or retain customers or market our services that relate to the creation or maintenance of secure IT systems; and\n\u2022\nbe unable to successfully market services that rely on the creation and maintenance of secure IT systems.\nWhile we maintain cyber risk insurance to provide some coverage for certain risks arising from cybersecurity breaches, there is no assurance that such insurance would cover all or a significant portion of the costs or consequences associated with a cybersecurity breach. In addition to these costs and the adverse effects described in this risk factor, a significant cyber breach could result in one or more of our customers terminating or reducing the scope of our contracts with them.\nSecurity breaches in customer systems could adversely affect our business.\nMany of the programs we support and the systems we develop, install and maintain involve managing and protecting information involved in intelligence, national security and other classified or sensitive customer functions. Losses from a security breach in one of these systems could cause serious harm to our business, damage our reputation and impact our eligibility for further work on critical systems for our current customers or for other U.S. government customers generally. Losses could also exceed the policy limits of our errors and omissions and product liability insurance coverage. If our reputation is damaged or our eligibility to compete for additional work is compromised our revenues could be adversely affected.\nCongress may fail to approve budgets on a timely basis for the federal agencies we support which could delay procurement of our services and solutions and cause us to lose future revenues.\nOn an annual basis, Congress must approve budgets that govern spending by the federal agencies that we support. In years when Congress is not able to complete its budget process before the end of the government fiscal year on September 30, Congress typically funds government operations pursuant to a continuing resolution, which allows federal government agencies to operate at spending levels approved in the previous budget cycle. When the government operates under a continuing resolution, funding we expect to receive from customers for current work may be delayed and new initiatives may be delayed or even canceled. The government's failure to complete its budget process, or to fund government operations pursuant to a continuing resolution, may result in a federal government shutdown. A prolonged delay in Congressional budget approval could delay our customers\u2019 procurement of our services and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur earnings and profitability may vary based on the mix of our contracts, and may be adversely affected if we fail to accurately estimate and manage our costs, time and resources.\nWe generate revenues under different types of government contracts, including cost-reimbursable, time-and-materials and fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and profitability may vary depending on changes in the amount of revenues we derive from each type of contract, the nature of services or solutions provided, or the level of achievement of performance objectives required to receive award fees. For example, cost-reimbursable contracts generally offer lower margin opportunities than fixed-price contracts, but tend to minimize financial risk. However, to varying degrees, each contract type involves some risk of underestimating the costs and resources necessary to fulfill the contract obligations. Our profitability is adversely impacted when we incur contract costs that we cannot bill to our customers. While fixed-price contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, these contracts also increase our exposure to the risk of cost overruns. When bidding on proposals involving fixed-price contracts, we rely heavily on our estimates of costs and the time required to complete the associated projects and make assumptions regarding technical issues. Our failure to accurately estimate these costs or the resources and technology necessary to perform these contracts, or to effectively manage and control our costs during performance of work could result, and in some instances has resulted, in reduced profits or\nin losses. More generally, any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with performing our contracts (including costs and delays caused by factors outside of our control) could make our contracts less profitable than expected.\nU.S. government contracts contain provisions giving our customers a variety of rights that are unfavorable to us, including the ability to terminate a contract at any time for convenience.\nU.S. government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that provide the government with rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts. Among other rights, these contracts give the government the ability to:\n\u2022\nterminate existing contracts for convenience, as well as for default;\n\u2022\nreduce orders under, or otherwise modify, contracts or subcontracts;\n\u2022\ndecline to exercise an option to renew multi-year contracts or issue task orders under multiple award contracts;\n\u2022\nsuspend or debar us from doing business with the U.S. government or with a government agency;\n\u2022\nterminate our facility security clearances and thereby prevent us from receiving classified contracts;\n\u2022\nclaim rights in products and systems produced by us; and\n\u2022\ncontrol or prohibit the export of our products and services.\nIf the government terminates a contract for convenience, we may recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, we may not even recover those amounts, and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source. If one of our government customers were to unexpectedly terminate, cancel or decline to exercise an option to renew one or more of our significant contracts or programs, our revenues and operating results would be materially harmed.\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations, and if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to severe penalties and sanctions and harm our business.\nAs a government contractor, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations that govern how we conduct business with our customers. The following are among the more noteworthy laws and regulations:\n\u2022\nthe Federal Acquisition Regulation and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, which comprehensively regulate the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts;\n\u2022\nTruthful Cost or Pricing Data, which requires certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations;\n\u2022\nthe Cost Accounting Standards and Cost Principles, which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-reimbursable U.S. government contracts;\n\u2022\nlaws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products, services and technical data;\n\u2022\nU.S. export controls, which apply when we engage in international work;\n\u2022\nthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and\n\u2022\nthe False Claims Act, which prohibits the submission of fraudulent claims to the government for payment or approval. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by either the government or by individuals on behalf of the government (who may then share a portion of any recovery).\nIf we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we may be subject to contractual damages, fines, civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions, and could harm our reputation. For more severe misconduct, sanctions and penalties may include the termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, the triggering of price reduction clauses, suspension of payments, fines and the suspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and future prospects.\nUnfavorable results of U.S. government audits or other investigations could adversely affect our profitability, harm our reputation and relationships with our customers or impair our ability to win new contracts.\nThe Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and other government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contracts and contractor systems. These agencies review our contract performance, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The DCAA and DCMA also review the adequacy of, and compliance with, internal control systems and policies, including accounting, purchasing, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Allegations of impropriety or deficient controls could harm our reputation or influence the award of new contracts. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed,\nwhile such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. If our internal control systems or policies are found to be non-compliant or inadequate, payments may be withheld or suspended, or we may be subject to increased government scrutiny and approval requirements that could delay or adversely affect our ability to invoice and receive timely payment for services we perform on our contracts. Adverse findings by DCAA or DCMA may also impair our ability to compete for and win new contracts with the U.S. government.\nWe may acquire businesses, and these transactions involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could adversely impact ongoing operations.\nAs part of our operating strategy, we selectively pursue acquisitions. These transactions pose many risks, including:\n\u2022\nour inability to identify suitable acquisition candidates at prices we consider attractive;\n\u2022\nour inability to compete successfully for an identified acquisition candidate, consummate an acquisition or accurately estimate the financial effect of acquisitions on our business;\n\u2022\ndifficulty retaining an acquired company's key employees, customers or contracts;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating acquired businesses, resulting in unforeseen difficulties and greater expense than anticipated;\n\u2022\nour failure to discover or adequately assess liabilities of a business that we acquire; and\n\u2022\nthe need to record write-downs from future impairments of intangible assets, which could reduce our future reported earnings.\nAcquired entities may not achieve to the level of profitability or revenue that we anticipate. Additionally, we may not realize anticipated synergies. If our acquisitions perform poorly, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe face risks associated with our international business, and our business operations in foreign countries involve considerable risks and hazards.\nOur business operations are subject to a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally, including, changes in or interpretations of foreign laws or policies that may adversely affect the performance of our services; political instability in foreign countries; business practices and customs that are unfamiliar or inconsistent with business practices in the U.S.; requirements to provide up-front performance bonds (guaranteed by a letter of credit from our lender); difficulties in collecting receivables and the lack of legal remedies in the event of contract disputes; adverse tax treatment; and additional compliance requirements relating to international and U.S. laws.\nWe also provide services to the U.S. government in foreign countries that may be experiencing political unrest, war or terrorism. In connection with these deployments, we may be exposed to increased risk of incurring liabilities arising from incidents involving our employees or third parties. We may also incur additional costs in connection with such deployments, such as increased insurance costs, the cost of liabilities that are in excess of or not covered by our insurance policies, or the costs of repatriation of our employees or executives for reasons beyond our control.\nGoodwill represents a significant asset on our balance sheet, and changes in future business conditions could cause these investments to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that would reduce our operating income.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our goodwill was $1.2 billion. The amount of our recorded goodwill may substantially increase in the future as a result of any acquisitions that we make. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. Impairment analysis is based on several factors requiring judgment and the use of estimates, which are inherently uncertain and based on assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, material changes in our financial outlook, as well as events outside of our control, such as deteriorating market conditions for companies in our industry, may indicate a potential impairment. When there is an impairment, we are required to write down the recorded amount of goodwill, which is reflected as a charge against operating income.\nCovenants in the instruments governing our revolving credit facility may restrict our financial and operating flexibility.\nWe maintain a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. The credit agreement provides for a $500 million revolving credit facility. The maturity date for the credit agreement is August 17, 2022. The credit agreement requires us to comply with specified financial covenants, including the maintenance of certain consolidated total leverage ratios and a certain fixed charge coverage ratio, and contains negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or impose restrictions on the ability of us to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, make acquisitions and undertake certain other actions. Additionally, an event of default under the credit agreement could result in our creditors exercising rights that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in tax law could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and certain other foreign jurisdictions. Any future changes in applicable federal, state and local, or foreign tax laws and regulations or their interpretation or application, including those that could have a retroactive effect, could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities in the future. Any final determination of tax audits or related litigation may be materially different than our current provisional amounts, which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate.\nOur quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. For these reasons, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may be of limited significance in some cases, and as such, you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. In addition to the risk factors already identified in this section of our Form 10-K, a number of additional factors could cause our revenues, cash flows and operating results to vary from quarter-to-quarter, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in revenues earned on fixed-price contracts and contracts with a performance-based fee structure;\n\u2022\ntiming of significant bid and proposal costs;\n\u2022\nseasonal or quarterly fluctuations in our workdays and staff utilization rates; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the volume of purchase requests from customers for equipment and materials.\nBecause most of our expenses are fixed, cash flows from our operations may vary significantly as a result of changes in the level of services we provide under existing contracts, as well as the number of contracts that are commenced, completed or terminated during any quarter. Depending on the nature of the contract, we may incur significant operating expenses during the start-up and early stages of large contracts and not receive corresponding payments from the customer in that same quarter. We may also incur significant or unanticipated expenses when a contract expires, terminates or is not renewed.\nWe may change our dividend policy in the future.\nWe have maintained a regular cash dividend program since 2011. We anticipate continuing to pay quarterly dividends during 2020. However, any future payment of dividends, including the timing and amount of any such dividends, is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and may depend upon our earnings, liquidity, financial condition, alternate capital deployment opportunities or any other factors that our Board considers relevant. A change in our regular cash dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nMr. Pedersen, our Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board, effectively controls us, and his interests may not be aligned with those of other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Mr. Pedersen owned approximately 33% of our total outstanding shares of common stock. Holders of our Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share, while holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to only one vote per share. As of December 31, 2019, Mr. Pedersen beneficially owned 13,187,195 shares of Class B common and controlled approximately 83% of the combined voting power of our stock. Accordingly, Mr. Pedersen controls the vote on substantially all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. As long as Mr. Pedersen beneficially owns a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, he will have the ability, without the consent of our public stockholders, to elect all members of our Board of Directors and to control our management and affairs.\nMr. Pedersen's voting control may have the effect of preventing or discouraging transactions involving an actual or a potential change of control of us, regardless of whether a premium is offered over then-current market prices. Mr. Pedersen will also be able to cause a change of control of us. Mr. Pedersen's voting control could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock if investors perceive disadvantages in owning stock in a company with such concentrated ownership.\nMr. Pedersen could also cause a registration statement to be filed and to become effective under the Securities Act of 1933, thereby permitting him to freely sell or transfer the shares of common stock that he owns, which could adversely affect the trading price of our stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit potential acquisition bids that you and other stockholders may consider favorable, and the market price of our Class A common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of us, even if a change of control were considered favorable by you and other stockholders. Among the provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, are provisions relating to the following: the high vote nature of our Class B common stock; the ability of our Board to issue preferred stock; the inability of stockholders to take action by written consent; and advance notice requirements relating to director nominations or other proposals submitted by our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 89307, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "MANT"}
