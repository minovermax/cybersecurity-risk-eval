{"cik": "861838", "company": "IDERA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K before purchasing our common stock. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these and currently unknown risks or uncertainties. In that case, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our securities.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.\nWe historically have experienced significant volatility in our stock price. Since December 31, 2021, our common stock has traded as low as $0.41 per share. The realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors or other unforeseen risks could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to declines in response to numerous factors, including disappointing results in a clinical program, as was the case following the announcement of topline results for ILLUMINATE-301. Other risk factors include results from clinical trials; FDA regulatory actions; announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, regulatory approvals, clinical milestones, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments; additions or departures of key personnel; commencement of, or our involvement in, litigation; and any major change in our Board of Directors or management.\nFrom time to time, we estimate the timing of the potential accomplishment of clinical and other development goals or milestones. These estimated milestones may include the commencement or completion of clinical trials. Also, from time to time, we expect that we will publicly announce the anticipated timing of some of these milestones. All these estimated milestones are based on numerous assumptions. These milestones may change and the actual timing of meeting these milestones may vary dramatically from our estimates, in some cases for reasons beyond our control. If we do not meet these estimated milestones, or the anticipated timing thereof, as publicly announced, our stock price may decline.\nWe may not be able to comply with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing standards.\nOur common stock trades on The Nasdaq Capital Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) under the symbol \u201cIDRA.\u201d There is also no guarantee that we will be able to perpetually satisfy Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements to maintain our listing on Nasdaq for any periods of time. Our failure to continue to meet these requirements may result in our securities being delisted from Nasdaq.\nOn November 26, 2021, we received a deficiency letter (the \u201cNasdaq Letter\u201d) from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department, notifying us that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), which requires the Company to maintain a minimum bid price of at least $1 per share for continued listing on Nasdaq (the \u201cMinimum Bid Requirement\u201d). The Company\u2019s failure to comply with the Minimum Bid Requirement was based on the Company\u2019s common stock per share price being below the $1 threshold for a period of 30 consecutive business days. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) (the \u201cCompliance Period Rule\u201d), the Company has been provided an initial period of 180 calendar days (the \u201cCompliance Date\u201d), to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement. If, at any time before the Compliance Date, the bid price for the Company\u2019s common stock closes at $1.00 or more per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, as required under Nasdaq requirements, the Staff will provide written notification to the Company that it complies with the Minimum Bid Requirement, unless the Staff exercises its discretion to extend this 10-day period pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(H).\nIf the Company does not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement by the Compliance Date, the Company may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day compliance period (the \u201cSecond Compliance Period\u201d). To qualify, the Company would need to meet the continued listing requirement for the market value of publicly held\nshares and all other initial listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the Minimum Bid Requirement, and provide written notice to the Staff of its intention to cure the deficiency during the Second Compliance Period.\nNeither the Nasdaq Letter nor the Company\u2019s noncompliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement have an immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company\u2019s common stock, which will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cIDRA.\u201d\nIf we fail to comply with Nasdaq rules and requirements, including, without limitation, the Minimum Bid Requirement, our stock may be delisted. In addition, even if we demonstrate compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement, we will have to continue to meet other objective and subjective listing requirements to continue to be listed on Nasdaq. Delisting from Nasdaq could make trading our common stock more difficult for investors, potentially leading to declines in our share price and liquidity. Without a Nasdaq listing, stockholders may have a difficult time getting a quote for the sale or purchase of our common stock, the sale or purchase of our common stock would likely be made more difficult, and the trading volume and liquidity of our common stock could decline. Delisting from Nasdaq could also result in negative publicity and could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. The absence of such a listing may adversely affect the acceptance of our common stock as currency or the value accorded by other parties. Further, if we are delisted, we would also incur additional costs under state blue sky laws in connection with any sales of our securities. These requirements could severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to sell our common stock in the secondary market. If our common stock is delisted by Nasdaq, our common stock may be eligible to trade on an over-the-counter quotation system, such as the OTCQB Market, where an investor may find it more difficult to sell our stock or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock. In the event our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, we may not be able to list our common stock on another national securities exchange or obtain quotation on an over-the counter quotation system.\nWe will need additional financing, which may be difficult to obtain on terms attractive to us or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe expect that we will need to raise additional funds in order to complete the development of, seek regulatory approvals for, and commercialization of our drug candidates for rare disease and to continue to fund our operations. We are seeking and expect to continue to seek additional funding through financings of equity or debt securities, collaborations, or the sale or license of assets. We believe the key factors that will affect our ability to obtain funding are: (i) the results of our clinical development activities in our drug candidates we develop on the timelines anticipated; (ii) the time and expense required to submit an NDA for our drug candidates; (iii) the cost, timing, and outcome of regulatory reviews; (iv) the receptivity of the capital markets to financings by biotechnology companies generally and companies with drug candidates and technologies similar to ours specifically; (v) receptivity of the capital markets to any in-licensing, product acquisition or other transaction we may enter into; and (vi) ability to enter into additional collaborations and the success of such collaborations.\nFinancing may not be available to us when we need it, or on favorable or acceptable terms, or at all. We could be required to seek funds through collaborative alliances or through other means that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies, drug candidates or drugs that we would otherwise pursue on our own. In addition, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, or an equity financing that involves existing stockholders may cause a concentration of ownership. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, and are likely to include rights that are senior to the holders of our common stock. Any additional debt or equity financing may contain terms which are not favorable to us or to our stockholders, such as liquidation and other preferences, or liens or other restrictions on our assets. As discussed in Note 13 to the financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K, additional equity financings may also result in cumulative changes in ownership over a three-year period in excess of 50% which would limit the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that we may utilize in any one year. If we are unable to obtain adequate funding on a timely basis or at all, we will be required to terminate, modify or delay clinical trials of our drug candidates, or relinquish rights to portions of our technology, drug candidates and/or products.\nWe expect that we will continue to incur net losses in the foreseeable future.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $735.5 million and a cash and cash equivalents balance of $32.5 million. We expect to incur substantial operating losses in future periods and will require additional capital as we seek to advance any future drug candidates through development to commercialization. We do not expect to generate product revenue, sales-based milestones or royalties until we successfully complete development of and obtain marketing approval for any future drug candidates, either alone or in collaboration with third parties, which may not occur or may take a number of years. To commercialize any future drug candidates, we need to complete clinical development and comply with comprehensive regulatory requirements. We are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties similar to those of other companies of the same size within the biotechnology industry, such as uncertainty of clinical trial outcomes, uncertainty of additional funding and history of operating losses.\nEven if we succeed in receiving marketing approval for and commercializing any product candidate, we will continue to incur substantial research and development and other expenditures to develop and market additional potential indications or products. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nRisks Relating to Our Business, Strategy, and Industry\nOur recent organizational changes undertaken to align to our focus on new business development opportunities may not be successful.\nIn April 2021, following the announcement that ILLUMINATE-301 did not meet its primary endpoint of ORR, we decided to implement a reduction-in-force affecting approximately 50% of our workforce starting at the second quarter of 2021. The objective of this workforce reduction was to realign our workforce to meet our needs in light of the outcome of ILLUMINATE-301\u2019s ORR endpoint. In May 2021, we announced that we would not continue ILLUMINATE-301 toward its OS endpoint. In connection with these actions, we have incurred termination costs, which include severance, benefits, and related costs, totaling $1.3 million in 2021.\nWe believe these changes were needed to streamline our organization and reallocate our resources to better align with our current strategic goals, including our current focus on new portfolio opportunities. However, these restructuring activities may yield unintended consequences and costs, such as the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, attrition beyond our intended reduction-in-force, a reduction in morale among our remaining employees, and the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits, all of which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, while positions have been eliminated certain functions necessary to our reduced operations remain, and we may be unsuccessful in distributing the duties and obligations of departed employees among our remaining employees. We may also discover that the reductions in workforce and cost cutting measures will make it difficult for us to pursue new opportunities and initiatives and require us to hire qualified replacement personnel, which may require us to incur additional and unanticipated costs and expenses. Moreover, there is no assurance we will be successful in our pursuit of any new business development opportunities, including additional strategic alternatives. Our failure to successfully accomplish any of the above activities and goals may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs a small biopharmaceutical-focused company with limited resources, we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nWe are a small company with 13 full-time employees as of December 31, 2021. Any future growth will require hiring additional qualified personnel. Also, because of the specialized scientific nature of our business, we face intense competition for qualified employees and consultants from biopharmaceutical companies, research organizations and academic institutions. Failure to attract and retain qualified personnel would materially harm our ability to compete effectively and grow our business.\nIf we lose any of our officers or key employees, our management and technical expertise could be weakened significantly.\nOur success largely depends on the skills, experience, and efforts of our executive officers, especially our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Vincent Milano. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees. The loss of any of our executive officers could weaken our management and technical expertise significantly and harm our business.\nWe are depending heavily on the development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of drug candidates. If we are unable to successfully develop and commercialize drug candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business may be materially harmed.\nWe have made and intend to continue to make a significant investment of our time and financial resources in the development and commercialization of our drug candidates. Our ability to generate product revenues will depend heavily on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize our drug candidates. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval and successfully commercialize our drug candidates, our business would be materially and adversely impacted. Even if our drug candidates receive regulatory approval, we will incur significant expenses to support its commercialization and launch, which investment may never be realized if sales are insufficient.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our drug candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the U.S.\nIn addition, some of our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for drug candidates that treat the same indications as our drug candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors' drug candidates. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials could also require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays may result in increased development costs for our drug candidates, which would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\nIf our clinical trials are unsuccessful, delayed or terminated, we may not be able to develop and commercialize our drug candidates.\nClinical trials are lengthy, complex, and expensive processes with uncertain results. We may not be able to complete any clinical trial of an investigational product within any specified time period. Moreover, clinical trials may not show our investigational products to have an acceptable safety and efficacy profile. The FDA, IRBs, or other equivalent foreign regulatory agencies may not allow us to complete these trials or commence and complete any other clinical trials.\nNumerous unforeseen events may occur during, or as a result of, preclinical testing, nonclinical testing or the clinical trial process that could delay or inhibit the ability to receive regulatory approval or to commercialize drug products. For example, setbacks in clinical trials may result in enhanced scrutiny by regulators or IRBs of clinical trials of our drug candidates, which could result in regulators or IRBs prohibiting the commencement of clinical trials, requiring additional nonclinical studies as a precondition to commencing clinical trials or imposing restrictions on the design or scope of clinical trials that could slow enrollment of trials, increase the costs of trials or limit the significance of the results of trials. Such setbacks could also adversely impact the desire of investigators to enroll patients in, and the desire of patients to enroll in, clinical trials of our drug candidates.\nOther events that could delay or inhibit conduct of our clinical trials include: (i) nonclinical or clinical data may not be readily interpreted, which may lead to delays and/or misinterpretation; (ii) our nonclinical tests, including toxicology studies, or clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results; (iii) we might have to suspend or terminate our clinical trials if the participating subjects experience serious adverse events or undesirable side effects or are exposed to unacceptable health risks; (iv) regulators or IRBs may hold, suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements, issues identified through inspections of manufacturing or clinical trial operations or clinical trial sites; (v) we, along with our collaborators and subcontractors, may not employ, in any capacity, persons who have been debarred under by FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities; (vi) we or our contract manufacturers may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our drug candidates for use in clinical trials; (vii) the cost of our clinical trials may be greater than we currently anticipate making continuation and/or completion improbable; (viii) our investigators and contract research organizations may not follow the applicable regulatory requirements; and (ix) our drug candidates may not cause the desired effects or may cause undesirable side effects or our drug candidates may have other unexpected characteristics.\nIn conducting clinical trials, we cannot be certain that any planned clinical trial will begin on time, if at all. Delays in commencing clinical trials of potential products could increase our drug candidate development costs, delay any potential revenues, reduce the potential length of patent exclusivity and reduce the probability that a potential product will receive regulatory approval. Significant clinical trial delays also could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our drug candidates.\nThe technologies on which we rely are unproven and may not result in any approved and marketable products.\nOur technologies or therapeutic approaches are relatively new and unproven. Further, the chemical and pharmacological properties of our drug candidates may not be fully recognized in preclinical studies and small-scale clinical trials, and such compounds may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways that we have not yet identified. Pre-clinical trials and early stage clinical trials may not be indicative of results that may be obtained in later stage trials. As a result of these factors, we may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval to market any product.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing, or commercializing drugs before or more successfully than us.\nThere are many other companies, public and private, actively engaged in discovery, development, and commercializing products and technologies that may compete with our drug candidate and program. Some potentially competitive products have been in development or commercialized for years. Many of the marketed products have been accepted by the medical community, patients, and third-party payors. Our ability to compete may be affected by the previous adoption of such products by the medical community, patients, and third-party payors.\nWe recognize that other companies, including large pharmaceutical companies, may be developing or have plans to develop products and technologies that may compete with ours. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we have and/or may have significantly greater experience than we have in undertaking preclinical studies and human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products for use in health care and manufacturing, and marketing and selling approved products. We anticipate that the competition with our drug candidates and technologies will be based on a number of factors including product efficacy, safety, availability, and price. The timing of market introduction of our drug candidates and competitive products will also affect competition among products. We expect the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete the clinical trials and approval processes, and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market to be important competitive factors.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, such as the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic, including disruptions to our clinical trials or the delay of regulatory approvals.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the ongoing worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility and uncertainty globally. This has resulted in an economic downturn and may disrupt our business and delay our clinical trials and regulatory approvals. This may also result in an interruption or issues with respect to the manufacture and supply of our product candidates. Quarantines and similar government orders have been enacted in each of the geographies in which we are conducting our clinical trials and may impact the ability of patients to participate in our trials. The patient populations that are eligible for our clinical trials may be immune-compromised and at higher risk for becoming infected with COVID-19. As COVID-19 affects the parts of the world where we are conducting our clinical trials, and the patients involved with these clinical trials become infected with COVID-19, we may have more adverse events and deaths in our clinical trials. The COVID-19 pandemic may also require that changes be made to any clinical trials or product manufacturing that may ultimately have an adverse impact. Additionally, if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA from conducting its regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Such concerns could also affect the ability of our personnel to perform their normal responsibilities and could result in temporary closures of our facilities.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy. However, any one or a combination of these events could have an adverse effect on the operation of and results from our clinical trials, which could prevent or delay us from obtaining approval for our drug candidates, or on our employee resources.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval and Marketing and Other Compliance Matters\nEven if we complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials, the marketing approval process is expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our drug candidates.\nWe are not permitted to market our drug candidates in the U.S. or in other countries until we, or any future collaborators, receive approval of an NDA from the FDA or marketing approval from applicable regulatory authorities outside of the U.S. The approval process is lengthy, often taking a number of years, is uncertain, and is expensive. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the drug candidate's safety and efficacy. Information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities is also required. Any delay in obtaining or failure to obtain required approvals could materially adversely affect our ability or that of any collaborators we may have to generate revenue from the particular drug candidate, which likely would result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely impact our stock price.\nOur failure to obtain marketing approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent our drug candidates from being marketed abroad which subjects us to additional business risks that could adversely affect our operations.\nWe, and any future collaborators, must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements in foreign jurisdictions. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional studies. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside of the U.S., it is required that the drug be approved for reimbursement before the drug can be approved for sale in that country. We, and any future collaborators, may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside of the U.S. on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside of the U.S. does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions or by the FDA.\nEven if we, or any future collaborators, obtain marketing approvals for our drug candidates, the terms of approvals and ongoing regulation of our drugs may limit how we, or they, manufacture and market our drugs, which could materially impair our ability to generate revenue.\nWe, and any future collaborators, must comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for any of our drug candidates for which we or they obtain marketing approval. Such promotional communications are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the drug\u2019s approved labeling. Thus, we, and any future collaborators, will not be able to promote any drugs we develop for indications or uses for which they are not approved.\nIn addition, manufacturers of approved drugs and those manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMPs, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and reporting requirements. We, our contract manufacturers, our future collaborators and their contract manufacturers could be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, and other regulatory authorities to monitor and ensure compliance with cGMPs.\nAccordingly, assuming we, or our future collaborators, receive marketing approval for one or more of our drug candidates, we, and our future collaborators, and our and their contract manufacturers will continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance and quality control.\nIf we, and our future collaborators, are not able to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements, we, and our future collaborators, could have the marketing approvals for our drugs withdrawn by regulatory authorities and our, or our future collaborators\u2019, ability to market any future drugs could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability. Further, the cost of compliance with post-approval regulations may have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nMoreover, legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict promotional activities relating to our drugs. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the\nmarketing approvals of our drug candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by Congress of the FDA's approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us and any collaborators to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nAny of our drug candidates for which we, or our future collaborators, obtain marketing approval in the future could be subject to post-approval restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we, and our future collaborators, may be subject to substantial penalties if we, or they, fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we, or they, experience unanticipated problems with our drugs following approval.\nAny of our drug candidates for which we, or our future collaborators, obtain marketing approval in the future, as well as the manufacturing processes, post-approval studies and measures, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such drug, among other things, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of a drug candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, including the requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, which could include requirements for a restricted distribution system.\nThe FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a drug. The FDA and other agencies, including the DOJ, closely regulate and monitor the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure that they are manufactured, marketed and distributed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use and if we, or our future collaborators, do not market any of our drug candidates for which we, or they, receive marketing approval for only their approved indications, we, or they, may be subject to warnings or enforcement action for off-label promotion.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our drugs or their manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements both before and after product approval, may yield various results, including: (i) litigation involving patients taking our drug; (ii) restrictions on such drugs, manufacturers or manufacturing processes; (iii) restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a drug; (iv) restrictions on drug distribution or use; (v) requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials; (vi) warning letters or untitled letters, as well as other enforcement and adverse actions; (vii) withdrawal of the drugs from the market; (viii) refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit; (ix) recall of drugs; (x) fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues; (xi) suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals; (xii) damage to relationships with any potential collaborators; (xiii) unfavorable press coverage and damage to our reputation; (xiv) refusal to permit the import or export of drugs; (xv) drug seizure; or (xvi) injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for applications of our drug candidates.\nThe FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of seven years of marketing exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nIn June 2017, the FDA granted us orphan drug designation for tilsotolimod for the treatment of melanoma Stages IIb to IV. However, there can be no assurance that we will obtain orphan drug designation or exclusivity for any other disease indications for which we develop tilsotolimod, or for any other drug candidates. There is also no guarantee that we will be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity if any product candidates with orphan designation are approved. Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition or the same drug can be approved for different conditions. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.\nA breakthrough therapy, fast track, or other expedited designation for our drug candidates may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that those drug candidates will receive marketing approval.\nWe may seek a breakthrough therapy, fast track, or other designation for appropriate drug candidates. Designations such as these are within the discretion of the FDA. The receipt of a designation for a drug candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our drug candidates qualify under one of FDA\u2019s designation programs, the FDA may later decide that the products no longer meet the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.\nWe have only limited experience in regulatory affairs and our drug candidates are based on new technologies; these factors may affect our ability or the time we require to obtain necessary regulatory approvals.\nWe have never obtained regulatory approval for, or commercialized, a drug. It is possible that the FDA may refuse to accept any or all of our planned NDAs for substantive review or may conclude, after review of our data, that our applications are insufficient to obtain regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates. The FDA may also require that we conduct additional clinical or manufacturing validation studies, which may be costly and time-consuming, and submit that data before it will reconsider our applications. Depending on the extent of these or any other FDA required studies, approval of any NDA that we submit may be significantly delayed, possibly for years, or may require us to expend more resources than we have available or can secure.\nWe are subject to extensive and costly governmental regulation, the violation of which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nOur product candidates are subject and any future commercial products will be subject to costly, extensive and rigorous domestic and foreign government regulation, as discussed under the caption \u201cGovernment Regulation\u201d within Item 1 of this Form 10-K. These requirements are continually evolving, which will require us to adapt our practices and processes, which we may not be able to do.\nIn addition, our future arrangements with third party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. These include, but are not limited to, the following: the Anti-Kickback Statute; the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; the False Claims Act; privacy laws such as HIPAA; transparency requirements; and analogous state and foreign laws. Additionally, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and require drug manufacturers to report information related to drug pricing and to certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and healthcare entities, or marketing expenditures.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, suspension and debarment from procurement and non-procurement transactions, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nWe depend on information technology, infrastructure, and data to conduct our business. Any significant disruption, or cyber-attacks, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are dependent upon information technology, infrastructure and data. Computer systems, including ours and those of our suppliers, partners and service providers, contain sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, and are vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, cyber-attacks (both malicious and random) and\nother natural or man-made incidents or disasters, which may be prolonged or go undetected. Such events are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. A significant interruption of our information technology could adversely affect our ability to manage and keep our operations running efficiently and effectively. An incident that results in a wider or sustained disruption to our business or products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLikewise, data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including our intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information of our employees, patients or other business partners may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. There can be no assurance that our efforts, or the efforts of our partners and vendors, will prevent service interruptions, or identify breaches in our systems, that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us. In addition, our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches.\nRisks Relating to Collaborators\nOur existing collaborations and any collaborations we enter into in the future may not be successful.\nOur current collaboration agreements, as more fully described within Item 1 of this Form 10-K, or any collaborations we may enter into in the future, may not be successful. The success of our collaborative alliances, if any, will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators. Our existing collaborations and any potential future collaborations have risks, including the following: (i) our collaborators may control the development (and timing thereof) of the drug candidates being developed with our technologies and compounds and/or the companion diagnostic to be developed for use in conjunction with our drug candidates; (ii) our collaborators may control the public release of information regarding the developments; (iii) disputes may arise in the future with respect to the ownership of or right to use technology and intellectual property developed with our collaborators; (iv) disagreements with our collaborators could delay or terminate the development of our products, or result in litigation or arbitration; (v) we may have difficulty enforcing the contracts if any of our collaborators fail to perform; (vi) our collaborators may terminate their collaborations with us, which could make it difficult for us to attract new collaborators or adversely affect the perception of us in the business or financial communities; (vii) our collaboration agreements are likely to be for fixed terms and subject to termination by our collaborators in the event of a material breach or lack of scientific progress by us; (viii) our collaborators may challenge our intellectual property rights or utilize our intellectual property rights in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property rights or expose us to potential liability; (ix) our collaborators may not comply with all applicable regulatory requirements; (x) our collaborators may under fund or not commit sufficient resources to the testing or development of our drug candidates; and (xi) our collaborators may develop alternative products either on their own or in collaboration with others, or encounter conflicts of interest or changes in business strategy or other business issues. Additionally, our collaborators will face the same development risks that we do and may not be successful in their efforts. Given these risks, it is possible that any collaborative alliance into which we enter may not be successful.\nIf we are unable to establish additional collaborative alliances, our business may be materially harmed.\nCollaborators provide the necessary resources and drug development experience to advance our compounds in their programs. We have entered into and expect to continue to seek to enter into collaborative alliances with pharmaceutical companies. Upfront payments and milestone payments received from collaborations help to provide us with the financial resources for our internal research and development programs. We believe additional resources will be required to advance compounds. If we do not reach agreements with additional collaborators in the future or if the terms of such a collaborative alliance on are not favorable to us, we may not be able to obtain the expertise and resources necessary to achieve our business objectives, our ability to advance our compounds will be jeopardized and we may fail to meet our business objectives. Moreover, collaborations are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document, and implement. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement collaborations on a timely basis.\nRisks Relating to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our discoveries, the value of our technology and products will be adversely affected.\nOur ability to develop and commercialize drugs depends in significant part on our ability to: (i) obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents; (ii) obtain licenses to the proprietary rights of others on commercially reasonably terms; (iii) operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others; (iv) prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights; and (v) protect our trade secrets.\nWe do not know whether any of our currently pending patent applications or those patent applications that we license will result in the issuance of any patents. Our issued patents and those that may be issued in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable, narrowed in the course of a post-issuance proceeding or circumvented, and the rights granted thereunder may not provide us proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Moreover, intellectual property laws may change and negatively impact our ability to obtain issued patents covering our technologies or to enforce any patents that issue. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing, and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thus reducing any advantage provided by the patent.\nBecause patent applications in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and because publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, neither we nor our licensors can be certain that we or they were the first to make the inventions claimed in issued patents or pending patent applications, or that we or they were the first to file for protection of the inventions set forth in these patent applications.\nThird parties may own or control patents or patent applications and require us to seek licenses, which could increase our development and commercialization costs, or prevent us from developing or marketing products.\nAlthough we have many issued patents and pending patent applications in the U.S. and other countries, we may not have rights under certain third-party patents or patent applications related to our compounds under development. Third parties may own or control these patents and patent applications in the U.S. and abroad. In particular, we are aware of certain third-party U.S. patents that contain claims related to immunostimulatory polynucleotides and their use to stimulate an immune response, as well as to antisense technology. Although we do not believe any of our TLR or antisense compounds under development infringe any valid claim of these patents, we cannot be assured that the holder of such patents would not seek to assert such patents against us or, if the holder did, that the courts would not interpret the claims of such patents more broadly than we believe appropriate and determine that we are in infringement of such patents. In addition, there may be other patents and patent applications related to our current or future drug candidates of which we are not aware. Therefore, in some cases, in order to develop, manufacture, sell or import some of our drug candidates, we or our collaborators may choose to seek, or be required to seek, licenses under third-party patents issued in the U.S. and abroad or under third-party patents that might issue from U.S. and foreign patent applications. In such an event, we would be required to pay license fees or royalties or both to the licensor. If licenses are not available to us on acceptable terms, we or our collaborators may not be able to develop, manufacture, sell or import these products, or may be delayed in doing so. Either of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may become involved in expensive patent litigation or other proceedings, which could result in our incurring substantial costs and expenses or substantial liability for damages, require us to stop our development and commercialization efforts or result in our patents being invalidated, interpreted narrowly or limited.\nThere has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology industry. We may become a party to various types of patent litigation or other proceedings regarding intellectual property rights from time to time even under circumstances where we are not practicing and do not intend to practice any of the intellectual property involved in the proceedings. In addition to litigation, we may become involved in patent office proceedings, including oppositions, reexaminations, supplemental examinations and inter partes reviews involving our patents or the patents of third parties. We may initiate such proceedings or have such proceedings brought against us. An adverse determination in any such proceeding, or in litigation, could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future drug candidates. An adverse determination in a proceeding involving a\npatent in our portfolio could result in the loss of protection or a narrowing in the scope of protection provided by that patent.\nThe cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the cost of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. If any patent litigation or other proceeding is resolved against us, we or our collaborators may be enjoined from developing, manufacturing, selling or importing our drugs without a license from the other party and we may be held liable for significant damages. We may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially acceptable terms or at all. In a patent office proceeding, such as an opposition, reexamination or inter partes review, our patents may be narrowed or invalidated. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time.\nOur intellectual property may be infringed by a third party.\nThird parties may infringe one or more of our issued patents or trademarks. We cannot predict if, when or where a third party may infringe one or more of our issued patents or trademarks. To counter infringement, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, there is no assurance that we would be successful in proving that a third party is infringing one or more of our issued patents or trademarks. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could also provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us, alleging that we infringe their intellectual property. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly and/or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question, any of which may adversely affect our business. Even if we are successful in proving in a court of law that a third party is infringing one or more of our issued patents or trademarks there can be no assurance that we would be successful in halting their infringing activities.\nRisks Relating to Product Manufacturing, Marketing and Sales, and Reliance on Third Parties\nEven if the compounds we may develop are successful in clinical trials and receive regulatory approvals, we or our collaboration partners may not be able to successfully commercialize them.\nEven if the compounds were successful in clinical development and receive regulatory approvals, it may never reach or remain on the market, be successfully developed into commercial products or gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors or the medical community for a number of reasons including: (i) it may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects; (ii) it may be difficult to manufacture on a scale necessary for commercialization; (iii) it may experience excessive product loss due to contamination, equipment failure, inadequate transportation or storage, improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error, natural disasters or other catastrophic events, inconsistency in yields or variability in product characteristics; (iv) it may be uneconomical to produce; (v) the timing of market introduction of the compounds we may develop and competitive products may be inopportune; (vi) political and legislative changes may make the commercialization of any product candidates we may develop in the future, more difficult; (vii) we may fail to obtain reimbursement approvals or pricing that is cost effective for patients as compared to other available forms of treatment or that covers the cost of production and other expenses; (viii) they may not compete effectively with existing or future alternatives; (ix) we may be unable to develop commercial operations and to sell marketing rights; (x) it may fail to achieve market acceptance; or (xi) we may be precluded from commercialization of a product due to proprietary rights of third parties.\nBecause we have limited manufacturing experience, and no manufacturing facilities or infrastructure, we are dependent on third-party manufacturers to manufacture drug candidates for us.\nWe have limited manufacturing experience and no manufacturing facilities, infrastructure or clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. In order to continue to develop our drug candidates, apply for regulatory approvals, and ultimately commercialize products, we need to develop, contract for or otherwise arrange for the necessary manufacturing capabilities. We currently rely upon third parties to produce material for nonclinical and clinical testing purposes and expect to continue to do so in the future. We also expect to rely upon third parties to produce materials that may be required for the commercial production of our drug candidates, if approved. Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our drug candidates may adversely affect our future profit\nmargins and our ability to develop drug candidates and commercialize any drug candidates on a timely and competitive basis. We currently do not have any long-term supply contracts.\nThere are a limited number of manufacturers who operate under the FDA's cGMP regulations capable of manufacturing our drug candidates. As a result, we may have difficulty finding manufacturers for our drug candidates suitable for our needs. If we are unable to arrange for third-party manufacturing of our drug candidates on a timely basis, or on acceptable terms, we may not be able to complete development of our drug candidates or market them.\nAny contract manufacturers with which we enter into manufacturing arrangements will be subject to extensive regulatory requirements and ongoing periodic, unannounced inspections by the FDA, or foreign equivalent, and corresponding state and foreign agencies or their designees to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements and other governmental regulations and corresponding foreign standards. Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with such requirements, regulations or standards could lead to a delay in the conduct of our clinical trials, or a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates. Such failure could also result in sanctions being imposed, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, product seizures or recalls, imposition of operating restrictions, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, or criminal prosecution.\nAdditionally, contract manufacturers may not be able to manufacture our drug candidates at a cost or in quantities necessary to make them commercially viable. Furthermore, changes in the manufacturing process or procedure, including a change in the location where the drug substance or drug product is manufactured or a change of a third-party manufacturer, may require prior FDA review and approval in accordance with the FDA's cGMP and NDA regulations. Contract manufacturers may also be subject to comparable foreign requirements. This review may be costly and time-consuming and could delay or prevent the launch of a drug candidate. The FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies at any time may also implement new standards or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing standards for manufacture, packaging or testing of products. If we or our contract manufacturers are unable to comply, we or they may be subject to regulatory action, civil actions or penalties.\nWe have no experience selling, marketing or distributing potential products and no internal capability to do so.\nAdvancing compounds through Phase 3 development and regulatory approval will require us to begin commercialization preparation activities and incur related expenses. These activities will include, among other things, the development of an in-house marketing organization and sales force, a market access and payor reimbursement strategy and a distribution function, which will require significant capital expenditures, management resources and time. If we are unable to adequately prepare the market for the potential future commercialization of compounds, we may not be able to generate product revenue once marketing authorization is obtained.\nIf we are unable or decide not to establish internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we will pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of our products; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or if we are able to do so, that they will have effective sales forces. Any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, which may not be successful. We may have little or no control over the marketing and sales efforts of such third parties and our revenue from product sales may be lower than if we had commercialized our product candidates ourselves. We also face competition in our search for third parties to assist us with the sales and marketing efforts of our product candidates. Finally, regardless of whether we contract out our sales and marketing functions, we will be responsible for the marketing and promotion of our products and may be held responsible should any products be improperly marketed or promoted.\nIf third parties on whom we rely for clinical and preclinical trials do not perform as contractually required or as we expect, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our drug candidates and our business may suffer.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct the clinical or preclinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates. We depend on independent investigators, contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d), and other third-party service providers in the conduct of the trials of our drug candidates and expect to continue to do so. We expect to contract with CROs for future clinical trials. We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our trials, but do not control many aspects of their activities. We are responsible for ensuring that each of our trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable regulations and protocols for the trial. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule, or at all, or may not conduct our trials in accordance with regulatory\nrequirements or our protocols. If these third parties fail to carry out their obligations, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties. This could be difficult, costly or impossible, and our preclinical or clinical trials may need to be extended, delayed, terminated or repeated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval in a timely fashion, or at all, for the applicable drug candidate, or to commercialize such drug candidate being tested in such trials. If we seek to conduct any of these activities ourselves in the future, we will need to recruit appropriately trained personnel and add to our research, clinical, quality and corporate infrastructure. Moreover, if we need to replace any third parties, we may not be able to do so in a timely fashion or on commercially reasonable terms.\nThe commercial success of any drug candidates that we may develop will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the medical community.\nAny products that we ultimately bring to the market, if they receive marketing approval, may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors or others in the medical community. For example, current cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy are well-established in the medical community, and doctors may continue to rely on these treatments. If our products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate product revenue and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our products, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including: (i) the prevalence and severity of any side effects; (ii) the efficacy and potential advantages over alternative treatments; (iii) the ability to offer our drug candidates for sale at competitive prices; (iv) relative convenience and ease of administration; (v) the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies; (vi) the strength of marketing and distribution support and the timing of market introduction of competitive products; and (vii) publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments.\nEven if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile, market acceptance of the product will not be known until after it is launched. Our efforts to educate patients, the medical community, and third-party payors about our drug candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful. Such efforts to educate the marketplace may require more resources than are required by conventional methods used by our competitors.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payors for any products that we may develop or acceptable prices for those products, our revenues and prospects for profitability will suffer.\nMost patients rely on Medicare, Medicaid, private health insurers, and other third-party payors to pay for their medical needs, including any drugs we may market. If third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage or reimbursement for any products that we may develop, our revenues and prospects for profitability will suffer.\nThird-party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit reimbursement for newly-approved products. These third-party payors may base their coverage and reimbursement on the coverage and reimbursement rate paid by carriers for Medicare beneficiaries. Furthermore, many such payors are investigating or implementing methods for reducing health care costs, such as the establishment of capitated or prospective payment systems. Cost containment pressures have led to an increased emphasis on the use of cost-effective products by health care providers, which could limit the price we might establish for products that we or our current or future collaborators may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us. In particular, third-party payors may limit the indications for which they will reimburse patients who use any products that we may develop or impose other patient access or utilization controls or limitations.\nWe face a risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain insurance.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that is inherent in the manufacturing, testing, and marketing of prescription drugs. We face a risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our drug candidates in clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims and product recalls may result in: (i) decreased demand for our drug candidates and products; (ii) damage to our reputation; (iii) regulatory investigations that could require costly recalls or product modifications; (iv) withdrawal of clinical trial participants; (v) costs to defend related ligation; (vi) substantial monetary awards to clinical trial participants or patients; (vii) loss of revenue; (viii) the diversion of\nmanagement's attention away from managing our business; and (ix) the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nAlthough we have product liability and clinical trial liability insurance that we believe is adequate, this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations. We may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate protection against potential liabilities. If we are unable to obtain insurance at acceptable cost or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we will be exposed to significant liabilities, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial position. These liabilities could also prevent or interfere with our commercialization efforts.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law, may prevent a change in control that stockholders may consider desirable.\nSection 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company or discourage a third party from attempting to take over our company. These provisions include: (i) a classified board of directors; (ii) limitations on the removal of directors; (iii) limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders; (iv) the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings; and (v) the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval. These provisions could: (i) have the effect of delay, defer or prevent a change in control of us or a change in our management that stockholders may consider favorable or beneficial or (ii) discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions.\nThe Company\u2019s amended and restated bylaws (\u201cBylaws\u201d) provide, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain legal actions between the Company and its stockholders, which could increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit the ability of the Company\u2019s stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum viewed by the stockholders as more favorable for disputes with the Company or the Company\u2019s directors, officers or other employees.\nOur Bylaws provide to the fullest extent permitted by law that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, other employee or stockholder of the Company to the Company or its stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, (iv) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, or (v) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company or its directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the Company\u2019s Bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions. The exclusive forum provision in our Bylaws would not apply to claims brought under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Additionally, such provision will not relieve us of our duty to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.\nApproximately 24% of our outstanding common stock is held (28% beneficially owned) by three stockholders. If these significant stockholders choose to act together, they could exert substantial influence over our business, and the interests of these stockholders may conflict with those of other stockholders.\nThere is a concentration of ownership of our outstanding common stock because approximately 24% of our outstanding common stock is owned by three stockholders. As of December 31, 2021: (i) Baker Bros. Advisors LP, and certain of its affiliated funds (collectively, \u201cBaker Brothers\u201d) beneficially owned 3.9% of our outstanding common stock, which excludes all convertible securities as a result of certain beneficial ownership limitations as discussed in\nNote 15 of this Form 10-K; (ii) entities affiliated with Pillar Invest Corporation (the \u201cPillar Investment Entities\u201d) beneficially owned 19.9% of our outstanding common stock; and (iii) Castellina Ventures Ltd. (\u201cCastellina\u201d and, together with Baker Brothers and Pillar Investment Entities, the \u201cSignificant Securityholders\u201d) beneficially owned 4.2% of our outstanding common stock. If any of our Significant Securityholders acted together, they could be able to exert substantial influence over our business. Additionally, the interests of the Significant Securityholders may be different from or conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. This concentration of voting power with the Significant Securityholders could delay, defer or prevent a change of control, entrench our management and the board of directors or delay or prevent a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us on terms that other stockholders may desire. In addition, conflicts of interest could arise in the future between us, on the one hand, and either of our Significant Securityholders on the other hand, concerning potential competitive business activities, business opportunities, the issuance of additional securities and other matters.\nThe issuance or sale of shares of our common stock could depress the trading price of our common stock.\nIf (i)we issue additional shares of our common stock or rights to acquire shares of our common stock in other future transactions, (ii) any of our existing stockholders sells a substantial amount of our common stock, or (iii) the market perceives that such issuances or sales may occur, then the trading price of our common stock may significantly decrease. In addition, our issuance of additional shares of common stock will dilute the ownership interests of our existing common stockholders.\nBecause we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, investor returns will be limited to any increase in the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to support our operations and finance the growth and development of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 82824, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "IDRA"}
