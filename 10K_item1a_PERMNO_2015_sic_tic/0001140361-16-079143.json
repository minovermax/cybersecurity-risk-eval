{"cik": "1587755", "company": "Intrawest Resorts Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-09-08", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The risks described below should be carefully considered together with the other information contained in this report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur industry is sensitive to weakness in the economy and we are subject to risks associated with the overall leisure industry.\nIf economic conditions in the United States and Canada or elsewhere in the world were to weaken, including high unemployment and erosion of consumer confidence, it could have a material adverse effect on our industry. We provide skiing and mountain adventure experiences with a relatively high cost of participation. An economic downturn or weak economic conditions generally could reduce consumer spending on recreational activities, resulting in declines in visits to, and spending at, our mountain resorts and CMH, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we may be unable to increase the price of our lift products or other offerings during an economic downturn despite our history of being successful in raising such prices under a variety of economic conditions.\nLeisure and business travel are particularly susceptible to various factors outside of our control, including terrorism,\nthe uncertainty of military conflicts, outbreaks of contagious diseases and the cost and availability of travel options.\nOur business is sensitive to the willingness of our guests to travel. Acts of terrorism, the spread of contagious diseases, political events and developments in military conflicts in areas of the world from which we draw our guests could depress the public's propensity to travel and cause severe disruptions in both domestic and international air travel and consumer discretionary spending, which could reduce the number of visitors to our resorts and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Many of our guests travel by air and the impact of higher prices for commercial airline services and availability of air services could cause a decrease in visitation to our resorts. A significant portion of our guests also travel by vehicle and higher gasoline prices could adversely impact our guests' willingness to travel to our resorts. Higher cost of travel may also affect the amount that guests are willing to spend at our resorts and could negatively impact our revenue, particularly for ancillary services.\nOur industry is vulnerable to lack of adequate snowfall or unseasonable weather conditions.\nThe ability to attract winter customers to mountain resorts is influenced by adequate snowfall and weather conditions. Warm weather may result in rain, snow melt and inadequate natural snowfall and may render snowmaking wholly or partially ineffective in maintaining skiing conditions. For example, the Eastern United States 2015/2016 ski season was marked by some of the warmest temperatures in the past 100 years and we experienced a decline in skier visits during the 2015/2016 ski season compared to prior years. Conversely, extreme weather conditions may adversely affect the customer experience or result in lift closures and may also make it difficult for customers to access mountain resorts. The early season snow conditions and skier perceptions of early season snow conditions influence the momentum and success of the overall ski season, including advance sales of season passes and frequency pass products at our mountain resorts. Although helicopter accessed skiing is less susceptible to customer fluctuations due to weather conditions than our mountain resorts, as most helicopter accessed skiing customers book their visits significantly in advance of the ski season, CMH remains susceptible to risks related to inclement weather because we provide customers with credits, which may be used during future seasons, if weather conditions prevent customers from reaching the guaranteed amount of vertical feet of skiing. As a result, inclement weather at our CMH sites during any given ski season may materially adversely affect our CMH results of operations. In addition, unseasonable weather or rain can adversely affect summer visits to our mountain resorts and helicopter accessed hiking sites.\nAdditionally, there is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate. The effects of climate change, including any impact of global warming, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is highly seasonal and the occurrence of adverse events during our peak periods could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we operate four-season resorts, we generate the vast majority of our revenue during our third fiscal quarter, which is the peak ski season, followed by the second fiscal quarter. As a result of the seasonality of our business, many of our mountain resorts and CMH typically experience operating losses during the first and fourth fiscal quarters of each fiscal year. In addition, throughout our peak quarters, we generate the highest daily revenue on weekends, during the Christmas/New Year\u2019s and Presidents\u2019 Day holiday periods and, in the case of our mountain resorts, during school spring breaks. Furthermore, we sell a significant portion of our season pass products, pre-sold destination packages and CMH trips during our first fiscal quarter and the first month of our second fiscal quarter. The seasonality of our revenue and our dependence on peak operating and selling periods increases the impact of certain events on our results of operations. The occurrence of any of the other risk factors discussed herein during these peak operating or selling periods could have a disproportionate and material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nVariations in the timing of peak holidays and weekends may affect the comparability of our results of operations.\nDepending on how peak holidays and weekends fall on the calendar, in any given year we may have more or fewer peak holidays and weekends in any given fiscal quarter compared to prior years, with a corresponding difference in a preceding or subsequent fiscal quarter. These differences can result in material differences in our quarterly results of operations and affect the comparability of our quarterly results of operations from one fiscal year to the next.\nWe are vulnerable to the risk of natural disasters, including forest fires, avalanches, landslides, drought and hurricanes.\nA severe natural disaster, such as a forest fire, avalanche, landslide, drought or hurricane, may not be fully covered by our insurance policies and may interrupt our operations, require evacuations, severely damage our properties and impede access to our properties in affected areas, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our ability to attract customers to our properties is influenced by the aesthetics and natural beauty of the outdoor environment where our properties are located. In the recent past, the combination of drought conditions and a pine-beetle epidemic led to an increase in forest fires in the Western United States, including Colorado. A severe forest fire or other natural disaster could damage our properties or surrounding areas and have a long-term negative impact on customer visitation, as it would take several years for the environment to recover. Our insurance policies may not cover lost revenue due to a decline in visitation caused by damage to our properties or surrounding areas.\nThere is a risk of accidents occurring at our mountain resorts or competing mountain resorts, which may reduce visitation and negatively impact our operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain guests depends, in part, upon the external perceptions of the Company and the industry, the quality and safety of our resorts, services and activities, including summer activities, and our corporate and management integrity. While we maintain and promote an on-mountain safety program, there are inherent risks associated with our resort activities. An accident or injury at any of our resorts or at resorts operated by our competitors, particularly an accident or injury involving the safety of guests and employees that receives media attention, could negatively impact our brand or reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence in the Company, reduce visitation at our resorts, and negatively impact our results of operations. The considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the impact of negative publicity. If any such incident occurs during a time of high seasonal demand, the effect could disproportionately impact our results of operations in a fiscal year.\nA disruption in our water supply would impact our snowmaking capabilities and operations.\nOur operations are heavily dependent upon our access to adequate supplies of water to make snow and otherwise conduct our operations. Availability of adequate supplies of water depends on the existence of adequate water rights as well as physical delivery of the water when and where it is needed. Additionally, our mountain resorts are subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to water rights. Changes in these laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations. In addition, drought conditions may adversely affect our water supply. At our mountain resorts in Colorado, we own or have ownership or leasehold interests in water rights individually or through stock ownership in ditch and reservoir companies, groundwater wells and other sources, and the availability of water through these sources is subject to change. In addition, in recent years the USFS had sought to obtain ownership of certain water rights owned by ski resorts located on USFS land. However, on December 23, 2015, following significant opposition by ski areas, the USFS issued a Final Directive abandoning this position and approving new ski area permit terms that do not require ski resorts to transfer water rights to the federal government as a condition of operating on public land, but focus instead on requiring ski areas to, among other things, (i) demonstrate that they have sufficient water to sustain their operations (which Winter Park has established and we expect Steamboat to also establish) and (ii) offer their water rights of whatever kind they may have to a proposed successor operator of the ski area. This new water provision is included in a new Special Use Permit that was issued for the Winter Park resort on April 28, 2016 and is expected to be included in all other ski area special use permits for use of National Forest lands in the future. Notwithstanding the foregoing, USFS policies are subject to review and change over time, and a significant change in law or policy, or actions by permit administrators under the current policy, that interfere with our access to adequate supplies of water to support our current operations or an expansion of our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face significant competition.\nOur mountain resorts directly compete with other resorts in their respective local and regional markets, as well as with other major destination resorts and non-ski vacation options. We also compete with other large resort operators for the sale of multi-mountain passes. Competition within the ski resort industry is based on multiple factors, including location, price, weather conditions, the uniqueness and perceived quality of the terrain for various levels of skill and ability, the atmosphere of the base village, the quality of food and entertainment and ease of travel to the resort (including direct flights by major airlines). In our Adventure segment, we face competition from heli-skiing and snowcat operators in Canada and the United States. Our ancillary aviation businesses face increasing competition from small independent operators that have certain advantages, including an ability to bid on certain government contracts that are allocated to small businesses. Within our Real Estate segment, our managed properties compete with rental management companies, locally-owned independent hotels, as well as facilities and timeshare companies that are owned or managed by national and international chains. These properties also compete for convention and conference business across the North American market. Competition within the hotel and lodging industry is generally based on quality and consistency of rooms, restaurants and meeting facilities and services, attractiveness of locations, availability of a global distribution system, price and other factors. Our competitors may have access to greater financial, marketing and other resources and may have access to financing on more attractive terms than us. As a result, they may be able to devote more resources to improving and marketing their offerings or more readily take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities. If we are unable to compete successfully, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be materially adversely affected.\nWe are not the sole property manager at our resorts.\nWe manage a significant portion of the lodging rooms available at our resorts and manage rental properties. We cannot require individuals who purchased condominiums in our U.S. developments to use our rental management services and, in recent years, third-party services that assist condominium owners in leasing their units without our involvement have become more prevalent. As a result, we have experienced a decline in the number of condominium owners using our rental management services.\nIn addition, since we are not involved in transactions where the condominium owner uses a third-party manager, we are unable to control the quality of the leased units or the customer experience. If customers are unsatisfied, the reputation of the entire development, including units we manage, may be harmed, as most customers do not distinguish between units managed by us and units managed by third parties. If a development\u2019s reputation for a positive customer experience deteriorates, it may become more challenging for us to attract customers to these developments. A decline in customers at a development located at one of our mountain resorts may also lead to a decline in revenue throughout the resort\u2019s business.\nWe operate on government land pursuant to the terms of governmental permits that may be revoked or not renewed.\nWe do not own all of the land on which we conduct our operations. Certain of our mountain resorts and CMH operate on federal or Crown land or land owned by other governmental entities pursuant to the terms of governmental permits, leases or other agreements. In many cases, the permits, leases or other agreements give the applicable agency, including the USFS, the right to review and comment on the construction of improvements in the applicable area and on certain other operational matters. Certain permits, leases or other agreements may also be terminated or modified by the applicable agency for specific reasons or in the event we fail to perform our obligations under the applicable permits, leases or other agreements. In addition, the permits, leases or other agreements may not be renewed. A termination or modification of any of our permits, leases or other agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Finally, British Columbia may issue additional permits or licences to third parties related to the land on which CMH operates, and such additional permits and licences may deteriorate the heli-skiing experience at CMH and increase competition.\nOur operations are subject to extensive laws, rules, regulations and policies administered by various federal, state, provincial and other governmental authorities.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, including those relating to lift operations, emissions to the air, discharges to water, storage, treatment and disposal of fuel, water and waste, land use, remediation of contaminated sites and protection of the environment, natural resources and wildlife. For example, future expansions of certain of our U.S. mountain facilities must comply with applicable forest plans approved under the National Forest Management Act, federal, state and foreign wildlife protection laws or local zoning requirements. In addition, most projects to improve, upgrade or expand our ski areas are subject to environmental review under the NEPA. The NEPA requires the Forest Service, or other governmental entities, to study any proposal for potential environmental impacts and include various alternatives in its analysis. Our ski area improvement proposals may not be approved or may be approved with modifications that substantially increase the cost or decrease the desirability of implementing the project.\nWe are also subject to worker health and safety laws and regulations. From time to time our operations are subject to inspections by environmental regulators or other regulatory agencies and we may be required to undertake certain remediation activities, including in connection with the onsite use and storage of chemicals and petroleum products that may result in spills or releases. Although to date the costs associated with remediation activities have been immaterial, we may be required to incur material remediation costs in the future. Our efforts to comply with applicable laws and regulations do not eliminate the risk that we may be held liable for breaches of these laws and regulations, which may result in fines and penalties or subject us to claims for damages. Liability for any fines, penalties, damages or remediation costs, or changes in applicable laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are dependent on significant infrastructure and our business and growth plans are capital intensive.\nWe must regularly expend capital to construct, maintain and renovate our properties in order to remain competitive, maintain the safety, value and brand standards of our properties and comply with applicable laws and regulations. Our infrastructure and equipment, including lifts and helicopters, are costly to maintain, repair and replace and are susceptible to unscheduled maintenance. Much of our infrastructure and equipment will eventually need to be replaced or significantly repaired or modernized, which could result in interruptions to our business. We cannot always predict where capital will need to be expended in a given fiscal year and capital expenditures can increase due to forces beyond our control. In certain cases, the cost of infrastructure or equipment repair or replacement may not be justified by the revenue at the applicable property. As a result, we may close a property, or reduce its offerings, if we determine that it is not cost efficient to replace, maintain or repair our infrastructure and equipment at the property.\nWe also plan to grow through investments in our revenue-generating infrastructure and acquisitions. We cannot be certain that we will have enough capital or that we will be able to raise capital by issuing equity or debt securities or through other financing methods on reasonable terms, if at all, to execute our business plan. A lack of available funds for capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, our ability to construct, maintain and renovate our properties is subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022construction delays or cost overruns, including those related to labor and materials;\n\u2022the requirement to obtain zoning, occupancy and other required permits or authorizations;\n\u2022governmental restrictions on the size or kind of development;\n\u2022force majeure events, including forest fires, avalanches, landslides, drought or hurricanes;\n\u2022design defects; and\n\u2022environmental concerns.\nIf we are not able to complete capital projects on schedule, or if our investments fail to improve the properties in the manner that we expect, our ability to compete effectively would be diminished and our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur future strategic alliance, acquisitions or other growth opportunities may not be successful.\nWe evaluate strategic alliance and acquisition opportunities both domestically and internationally where the opportunity would provide a strategic fit within our existing portfolio of businesses and we may actively pursue such opportunities from time to time, some of which could be significant. In addition, we intend to evaluate \u201ccapital light\u201d opportunities, such as managing third-party resort assets and entering into real estate development partnerships. We cannot predict whether we will realize all of the anticipated benefits and synergies from businesses we acquire. We may also underestimate the resources and costs required to integrate acquired operations and we may be unable to predict the impact any acquisition will have on our future results of operations. The integration process is inherently unpredictable and subject to delay and unexpected costs.\nAcquisitions involve significant risks, including:\n\u2022\nour potential over-valuation of acquired companies, properties or assets;\n\u2022\ndelays in realizing or a failure to realize the benefits, revenue, cost savings and synergies that we anticipate;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain key personnel or business relationships and maintain the reputation of the acquired company, property or asset;\n\u2022\nthe potential impairment of acquired assets;\n\u2022\ninsufficient, or no, indemnification for legal liabilities;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of known or unknown liabilities and additional risks of the acquired businesses or properties, including environmental liabilities; and\n\u2022\noperating difficulties that require significant financial and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations.\nWe may not be able to obtain financing for acquisitions or other transactions on attractive terms, or at all, and the ability to obtain financing may be restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness or other indebtedness we may incur. In addition, our competitors may be able to obtain financing on more attractive terms than us.\nSteamboat is highly dependent on contracted direct air service from major hub airports.\nA significant portion of Steamboat\u2019s destination customers fly directly from large hub airports to the Yampa Valley Regional Airport, which is approximately 25 miles from the resort. Each ski season, we enter into agreements with major airlines to fly these routes and provide the airlines with subsidies if passenger volume falls below certain pre-established levels. If the routes prove unprofitable to the airlines and any of these airlines decides to stop service to this airport, Steamboat\u2019s skier visits could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness, and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business.\nWe depend on the use of information technology and systems, including technology and systems used for reservations, point of sale, e-commerce, accounting, procurement, administration and technologies we make available to our customers. We are currently in the process of updating or replacing many of these systems. Delays or difficulties in implementing these new or enhanced systems may prevent us from achieving the desired results in a timely manner or at all. Additionally, we may face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet to our information technology and systems, to intentionally hack, interfere with or cause physical or digital damage to or failure of such systems (such as significant viruses or worms), which attempts we may be unable to prevent. We could be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects until after it is too late to prevent it and the damage it may cause. We have experienced minor outages in the past. Any future interruptions, outages or delays in our systems, or deterioration in their performance, could impair our ability to process transactions and could decrease the quality of service that we offer to our customers.\nOur future success depends on our ability to adapt our infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands and to respond to competitive service and product offerings. The failure to adopt new technologies and systems in the future may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNon-compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (\u201cPCI DSS\u201d) may subject us to fines, penalties and civil liability.\nWe are subject to compliance with PCI DSS, an information security standard for organizations that handle cardholder information from major debit and credit card companies. Currently, we are generally compliant within our applicable PCI DSS merchant level and its requisite criteria; however, our level and the requisite criteria are subject to change. We continue to take steps to improve our PCI DSS compliance, but our efforts may result in significant expenses and failure to fully comply with PCI DSS may subject us to fines, penalties and civil liability, and other potential enforcement actions, and may result in the loss of our ability to accept debit and credit card payments or prohibit us from processing transactions through American Express, MasterCard, VISA and other card and payment networks. Even if we are compliant with PCI DSS or other applicable standards, we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving customer transaction data, though we have taken steps to diminish this risk.\nFailure to maintain the integrity of customer or employee data or to use data properly could result in damage to our reputation and subject us to fines, penalties and civil liability.\nWe collect and store personally identifiable information from customers and employees in the course of doing business and use it for a variety of business purposes, including marketing to our customers through various forms of media. State, provincial and federal governments have enacted laws and regulations to protect consumers and employees against unwanted communications and identity theft, including laws governing treatment of personally identifiable information. The regulatory environment and increased threats to the data we store has increased our costs of doing business. Additionally, the regulatory environment, as well as the requirements imposed on us by the payment card industry, governing information, security and privacy laws are increasingly demanding and continue to evolve and, on occasion, may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Any failure on our part to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of breaches or unauthorized access as required by applicable laws, or failure on our part to comply with applicable laws regarding consent to consumer communications, could result in damage to our reputation, early termination of our contracts, increased processing fees, litigation or regulatory investigations, or subject us to fines, penalties and civil liabilities. If we are required to pay any significant amounts in satisfaction of claims under these laws, or if we are forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully with any such law, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nDespite our efforts, information networks and systems are vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors, or from attacks by malicious third parties. In recent years, there has been a rise in the number of sophisticated cyber-attacks on network and information systems, and as a result, the risks associated with such an event continue to increase. Although we have taken, and continue to take steps to address these concerns by implementing network security and internal controls, there can be no assurance that a system interruption, security breach or unauthorized access will not occur. Any such interruption, breach or unauthorized access to our network or systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us.\nOur business depends on the quality and reputation of our brands, and any deterioration in the quality or reputation of our brands could have an adverse impact on our business.\nA negative public image or other adverse events could affect the reputation of one or more of our mountain resorts and other businesses or more generally impact the reputation of our company. If the reputation or perceived quality of our brands declines, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The unauthorized use of our trademarks could also diminish the value of our brands and their market acceptance, competitive advantages or goodwill, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, a negative public image or other adverse event occurring in an industry where we operate or a related industry may harm our reputation even if such image or event does not directly relate to our brands or business.\nWe are subject to risks related to currency fluctuations.\nWe present our financial statements in United States dollars (\"USD\"). Our operating results are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as a significant portion of our revenue and operating expenses are transacted in Canadian dollars. During fiscal 2016, total Canadian dollar denominated revenue comprised approximately 41% of our total revenue. Any negative impact on revenue would be naturally hedged, in part, by our Canadian dollar denominated operating expenses. A significant fluctuation in the Canada/U.S. exchange rate could therefore have a significant impact on our results of operations after translating our Canadian operations into United States dollars. See Part II-Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, \"Foreign Currency Fluctuations\".\nCurrency variations can also contribute to variations in sales at our Canadian mountain resorts and CMH because volatility in foreign exchange rates can impact our customers\u2019 willingness to purchase lift passes or CMH packages. For example, an increase in the value of the Canadian dollar compared to the United States dollar or euro may make our CMH packages less attractive to American and European skiers, respectively.\nCertain circumstances may exist whereby our insurance coverage may not cover all possible losses and we may not be able to renew our insurance policies on favorable terms, or at all.\nAlthough we maintain various property and casualty insurance policies and undertake safety and loss prevention programs to address certain risks, our insurance policies do not cover all types of losses and liabilities and in some cases may not be sufficient to cover the ultimate cost of claims which exceed policy limits. If we are held liable for amounts exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage or for claims outside the scope of our coverage, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, we may not be able to renew our current insurance policies on favorable terms, or at all. Our ability to obtain future insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected if we or other companies within or outside our industry sustain significant losses or make significant insurance claims.\nWe are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business and related to our legacy real estate development activities.\nWe are involved in various lawsuits and claims that may include, among other things, claims or litigation relating to personal injury and wrongful death, allegations of violations of laws and regulations relating to our real estate activities, labor and employment, intellectual property and environmental matters, and commercial contract disputes. For example, we are, from time to time, subject to various lawsuits and claims related to injuries occurring at our properties, including due to the use, operation or maintenance of our trails, lifts, aircraft and other facilities.\nIn addition, we are a defendant in lawsuits related to our pre-2010 legacy real estate development and sales activities, including claims related to alleged construction defects and alleged violations of state and federal laws that require providing purchasers with certain mandated disclosures. Any such claims, regardless of merit, are time consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources and may materially adversely affect our reputation, even if resolved in our favor. Accordingly, the outcome or existence of current or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we do not retain our key personnel, our business may suffer.\nThe success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of key management personnel, including our senior executive officers. If any of these persons were to leave, it could be difficult to replace them, and our business could be harmed. We do not maintain \u201ckey-man\u201d life insurance on any of our employees.\nWe depend on a seasonal workforce.\nWe recruit year-round to fill thousands of seasonal positions. Because much of this hiring is done months in advance of the start of the applicable season, we may not be able to accurately predict our staffing needs. In addition, we may not be able to recruit and hire adequate seasonal personnel or hire such personnel at costs consistent with our costs in prior years. This risk is heightened in periods of economic strength, as the market for seasonal labor may become more competitive.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our workforce.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and provincial laws governing matters such as minimum wage requirements, overtime compensation and other working conditions, citizenship requirements, discrimination and family and medical leave. Changes to any of these laws, including, but not limited to, further potential increases in state and federally mandated minimum wages, could significantly impact our labor costs. Our operations in Canada are also subject to laws that may require us to make severance or other payments to employees upon their termination.\nImmigration law reform could also impact our workforce because we recruit and hire foreign nationals as part of our seasonal workforce. If our labor-related expenses increase, our operating expenses would increase and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nFrom time to time, we have also experienced non-union employees attempting to unionize. While only a small portion of our employees are unionized at present, we may experience additional union activity in the future. In addition, future legislation could make it easier\nfor unions to organize and obtain collectively bargained benefits, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be requested to contribute capital to entities in which we own a minority interest, which would reduce our liquidity or dilute our ownership interest.\nWe own non-controlling interests in several entities, as well as a controlling 20% interest in Alpine Helicopters. From time to time we may need to contribute capital to one or more of these entities to preserve the value of our investment or for other reasons. Historically, we have made contributions to entities in which we own a minority interest and may make additional contributions in future periods. In addition, from time to time we contribute funds to legacy development partnerships to defend claims against those entities to avoid having default judgments entered which could then potentially be asserted against us. In fiscal 2016, we contributed $0.6 million to these legacy development partnerships. These contributions reduce our cash available for operations and growth initiatives.\nOur real estate development strategy may not be successful.\nOur real estate development activities are focused on designing strategies for the development of the land surrounding the base areas of our mountain resorts. Prior to 2010, we were actively engaged in the development of residential real estate, primarily in the United States and Canada. Since 2010, our real estate development activities have been limited to the preservation of core development parcels located at our resorts and, more recently, designing strategies for the future development of this land. Our ability to implement any of these strategies and realize the anticipated benefits of future real estate development projects is subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nlack of improvement, or deterioration, in real estate markets;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in selling units or the ability of buyers to obtain necessary funds to close on units;\n\u2022\nescalation in construction costs due to price increases in commodities, unforeseen conditions, cost of insurance, inadequate designs or other causes;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages and inadequate internal resources to manage projects;\n\u2022\nshortages in building materials;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in financing real estate development projects; and\n\u2022\ndifficulty in receiving necessary regulatory approvals.\nIf these projects are not implemented, in addition to not realizing intended profits from the real estate developments and sales from ancillary products, our customers may choose to go to other resorts that they perceive to have better residential offerings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, even if we increase the number of units or beds at our mountain resorts, the projects may not be successful and we may be unable to realize incremental visitor growth or profits.\nCMH is dependent on Alpine Helicopters.\nIn January 2013, we restructured our Alpine Helicopters business to comply with Canadian foreign ownership regulations governing aviation flight services in Canada. The restructuring involved the formation of a new flight services company, Alpine Helicopters. Alpine Helicopters is a variable interest entity for which the Company is the primary beneficiary and is consolidated in the consolidated financial statements. We own a 20% equity interest in Alpine Helicopters and the remaining 80% equity interest is held in trust for the benefit of the management and employees of Alpine Helicopters, including the pilots and crew members that support our helicopter operations, and is reflected as a non-controlling interest in the consolidated financial statements.\nAlpine Helicopters employs all the pilots who fly the helicopters in the CMH land tenures. As a result of its reliance on Alpine Helicopters, CMH\u2019s business and operations would be negatively affected if Alpine Helicopters were to experience significant disruption affecting its ability to provide helicopter services to CMH. The partial or complete loss of Alpine Helicopter\u2019s services, or a significant adverse change in our relationship with Alpine Helicopters, could result in lost revenue and added costs and harm the image and reputation of CMH as well as negatively impact the CMH customer experience.\nWe have underfunded pension obligations.\nAs of June 30, 2016, we had underfunded pension plan liabilities in frozen pension plans in the amount of $33.6 million. Significant changes in the market values of the investments held to fund the pension obligations or a change in the discount rate used to measure these pension obligations may result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of these pension obligations, and these changes may affect the net periodic pension cost in the year the change is made and in subsequent years. We may not generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy these obligations. Any inability to satisfy these pension obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards.\nWe have recorded a full valuation allowance against these net operating loss carryforwards because we believe that uncertainty exists with respect to the future realization of the loss carryforwards. Additionally, the amount of the loss carryforwards that will be available in future periods could change in the event of adjustments related to audits by the relevant tax authorities for open years. A portion of these loss carryforwards has been reduced as a result of the Restructuring. To the extent available, we intend to use these net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income associated with our operations. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient taxable income in the carryforward period to utilize any remaining loss carryforwards before they expire.\nIn addition, Section 382 and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), contain rules that limit for U.S. federal income tax purposes the ability of a company that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d to utilize its net operating losses and certain other tax attributes existing as of the date of such ownership change. Under these rules, such an ownership change is generally an increase in ownership by one or more \u201cfive percent shareholders,\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code, of more than 50% of a company\u2019s stock, directly or indirectly, within a rolling three-year period. If we undergo one or more ownership changes within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code, or if one has already occurred, our net operating losses and certain other tax attributes existing as of the date of each ownership change may be unavailable, in whole or in part, to offset our income and/or reduce or defer our future taxable income associated with our operations, which could have a negative effect on our financial results. While we believe that we have not undergone such an ownership change as of the date hereof, because such an event is outside of our control, no assurance can be given that an ownership change has not already occurred or that future transactions will not result in an ownership change. Any future offerings of equity securities by us or sales of common stock by entities managed or controlled by Fortress Investment Group, LLC (collectively \u201cFortress\u201d) would increase the likelihood that we undergo an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code. If an ownership change occurs, the annual utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be materially and adversely affected. Our ability to raise future capital by issuing common stock without causing an ownership change may be materially limited.\nIf we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the trading price of our common stock may be negatively affected.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. We are also required, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"), to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also generally requires an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of the exemption permitting us not to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement. Our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. If we fail to fully implement the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, we may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, including the SEC and the NYSE. Furthermore, if we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, including the SEC and the NYSE. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Capital Structure\nOwnership of our common stock is highly concentrated and Fortress maintains a right to nominate up to a majority, plus two, of our directors, which may prevent stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest.\nFortress beneficially owns approximately 68.0% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, Fortress will beneficially own shares sufficient for the majority vote over all matters requiring a stockholder vote, including:\n\u2022\nthe election of directors;\n\u2022\nmergers, consolidations and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other decisions affecting our capital structure;\n\u2022\nthe amendment of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nour winding up and dissolution.\nIn addition, pursuant to the stockholders' agreement with Fortress, Fortress may designate directors for nomination and election to our board of directors. Pursuant to these provisions, Fortress has the ability to appoint up to a majority of the members of our board of directors, plus two directors, for so long as Fortress beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, at least 30% of our issued and outstanding common stock and certain other conditions are met.\nThis concentration of ownership may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by our other stockholders. The interests of Fortress may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders. Also, Fortress may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment in us, but which might involve risks to our other stockholders or adversely affect us or our other stockholders. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline or stockholders might not receive a premium over the then-current market price of our common stock upon a change in control. In addition, this concentration of share ownership and the ability of Fortress to appoint up to a majority of the members of our board of directors, plus two directors, may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with significant stockholders.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock.\nAny declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, our operating results, our current and anticipated cash needs, the impact on our effective tax rate, our indebtedness, legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. Our debt agreements limit our ability to pay dividends.\nBecause we are a holding company, our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock will depend on the receipt of dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries. Under Delaware law, dividends may be payable only out of surplus, which is calculated as our net assets less our capital, or, if we have no surplus, out of our net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Until such time that we pay a dividend, our investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nFuture offerings of equity securities by us or sales of our common stock by Fortress may adversely affect us.\nIn the future, we may issue additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities in connection with financing transactions, our incentive plans or acquisitions. Issuing additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities or securities convertible into equity may dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock or both. Preferred shares, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock. Holders of our common stock bear the risk that our future offerings may reduce the market price of our common stock and dilute their ownership of us.\nIn addition, any issuances of stock by us or sales of stock by Fortress would increase the likelihood that we undergo, or may cause, an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code. If we undergo one or more ownership changes within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code, our net operating losses and certain other tax attributes existing as of the date of each ownership change may be unavailable, in whole or in part, to offset our income and/or reduce or defer our future taxable income associated with our operations, which could have a negative effect on our liquidity. No assurance can be given that any such stock issuance or sale will not cause us to undergo an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code. The interests of Fortress may differ from our interests or the interests of our other stockholders and Fortress may decide to sell shares of stock even if such sale would not be favorable to us or our other stockholders or would result in us undergoing an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code.\nWe are a party to various joint purchasing agreements with Fortress that enable us to purchase some goods and services used in the normal course of business at reduced or discounted rates. If we were to undergo an ownership change, it may cause us to need to renegotiate purchasing agreements that may result in increased prices on goods and services acquired.\nCertain provisions of the stockholders' agreement, our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control of us, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur stockholders' agreement with Fortress, our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors and Fortress. These provisions provide:\n\u2022\nfor a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nfor removal of directors only for cause and only with the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote (provided, however, that for so long as Fortress beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, at least 30% of our issued and outstanding common stock, directors may be removed with or without cause with the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote);\n\u2022\nfor prohibitions on stockholders in regards to calling special meetings of our stockholders (provided, however, that for so long as Fortress beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common stock, any stockholders that collectively beneficially own at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common stock may call special meetings of our stockholders);\n\u2022\nfor advance notice requirements by stockholders with respect to director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings;\n\u2022\ncertain rights to Fortress with respect to the designation of directors for nomination and election to our board of directors, including the ability to appoint up to a majority of the members of our board of directors, plus two directors, for so long as Fortress beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, at least 30% of our issued and outstanding common stock and certain other conditions are met.\n\u2022\nfor no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock can elect all the directors standing for election;\n\u2022\nthat action by our stockholders outside a meeting may only occur by unanimous written consent; provided, however, that for so long as Fortress beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common stock, our stockholders may act without a meeting by written consent of a majority of our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nthat our board of directors has the authority to cause the issuance of preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and to establish the terms, preferences and rights of any such series of preferred stock, all without approval of our stockholders. Nothing in our restated certificate of incorporation precludes future issuances without stockholder approval of the authorized but unissued shares of our common stock.\nIn addition, these provisions may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by Fortress, our management or our board of directors. Public stockholders who might desire to participate in these types of transactions may not have an opportunity to do so, even if the transaction is favorable to stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change in control or change our management and board of directors and, as a result, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the ability to realize any potential change of control premium.\nFortress has the right to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as we do and waiver of the corporate opportunity provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation could enable Fortress and certain stockholders to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us.\nFortress has other investments and business activities in addition to their ownership of us, including in the industries in which we operate. Fortress has the right, and has no duty to abstain from exercising such right, to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us, do business with any of our customers or vendors or employ or otherwise engage any of our officers, directors or employees.\nUnder our restated certificate of incorporation, if Fortress or any of its officers, directors or employees acquire knowledge of a potential transaction that could be a corporate opportunity, they have no duty to offer such corporate opportunity to us, our stockholders or affiliates. In addition, we have renounced any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, such corporate opportunities and, in the event that any of our directors and officers who is also a director, officer or employee of Fortress, acquires knowledge of a corporate opportunity or is offered a corporate opportunity, provided that this knowledge was not acquired solely in such person\u2019s capacity as our director or officer and such person acted in good faith, then such person is deemed to have fully satisfied such person\u2019s fiduciary duty and is not liable to us if Fortress pursues or acquires such corporate opportunity or if such person did not present the corporate opportunity to us.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nPursuant to our restated certificate of incorporation, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n\u2022\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents or our stockholders;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware; or\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine,\nin each such case subject to the Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. In the event that the Court of Chancery lacks jurisdiction over any such action or proceeding, our restated certificate of incorporation provides that the sole and exclusive forum for such action or proceeding will be another state or federal court located within the State of Delaware. Our restated certificate of incorporation further provides that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provision. The forum selection clause in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur credit agreement contains, and future debt agreements may contain, restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur credit agreement contains, and documents governing our future indebtedness may contain, numerous covenants that limit the discretion of management with respect to certain business matters. These covenants place restrictions on, among other things, our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends and make other distributions and restricted payments, make certain loans, acquisitions and other investments, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends, engage in certain transactions with stockholders or affiliates, sell certain assets or engage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations, reinvest the proceeds from certain asset sales, amend or otherwise alter the terms of our subordinated indebtedness and create liens. Our credit agreement also requires, and documents governing our future indebtedness may require, us or our subsidiaries to meet certain financial ratios and tests in order to incur certain additional debt, make certain loans, acquisitions or other investments, reinvest the proceeds from certain asset sales, or pay dividends or make other distributions or restricted payments. Our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to comply with these and other provisions of our debt agreements are dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants or noncompliance with any of these financial ratios and tests could result in an event of default under the applicable debt agreement, which, if not cured or waived, could result in acceleration of the related debt and the acceleration of debt under other instruments evidencing indebtedness that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. In addition, variable rate indebtedness, which represents approximately 99.8% of our total outstanding debt, subjects us to the risk of higher interest rates, which could cause our future debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nOur substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our growth strategy, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.\nWe are significantly leveraged, which could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\na substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for operations, future business opportunities and capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate purposes in the future may be limited;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to repay our indebtedness from the proceeds of certain asset sales, rather than reinvesting the proceeds;\n\u2022\ncertain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which increase our vulnerability to increases in interest rates;\n\u2022\nwe will be at a competitive disadvantage to lesser leveraged competitors;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions;\n\u2022\nthe debt service requirements of our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations; and\n\u2022\nwe may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business and we may be unable to carry out activities that are important to our growth.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance indebtedness depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the international banking and capital markets.\nRisks Related to Our Equity\nThe market price of our common stock could be negatively affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets.\nAs of September 2, 2016, there were 39,770,271 shares of our common stock outstanding. All of our issued and outstanding shares are freely tradable, except for any shares held by our \u201caffiliates,\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). Approximately 27,038,250 shares, or 68.0% of our outstanding shares, are held by affiliates and can be resold into the public markets in the future in accordance with the requirements of Rule 144.\nPursuant to our stockholders' agreement with Fortress, Fortress and permitted third party transferees have the right, in certain circumstances, to require us to register their shares of our common stock under the Securities Act for sale into the public markets. The timing of such sales is uncertain and could be influenced by numerous factors, including the market price of our common stock, economic conditions and the contractual obligations or liquidity needs of Fortress.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline significantly when Fortress elects to sell a significant number of shares of our common stock. A decline in the price of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of common stock or other equity securities.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock have been and may continue to be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include:\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\noperating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nchange in valuations;\n\u2022\nchanges in the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or companies in our industries of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, plans, prospects, service offerings or operating results;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our securities;\n\u2022\nour limited public float and therefore trading volume;\n\u2022\nother risk factors discussed herein; and\n\u2022\nother unforeseen events.\nStock markets in the United States have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Market fluctuations, as well as general political and economic conditions such as acts of terrorism, prolonged economic uncertainty, a recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 14393, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "SNOW"}
