{"cik": "835324", "company": "Stock Yards Bancorp, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nInvestment in Bancorp\u2019s common stock involves risk, and Bancorp\u2019s profitability and success may be affected by a number of factors including those discussed below.\nFinancial condition and profitability depend significantly on local and national economic conditions.\nOur success depends on general economic conditions both locally and nationally. Most of Bancorp\u2019s customers are in the Louisville, Indianapolis, and Cincinnati metropolitan areas. Compared to regional or national financial institutions, we are less able to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies. Some of Bancorp\u2019s customers are directly impacted by the local economy while others have more national or global business dealings. Some of the factors influencing general economic conditions include tepid economic recovery, and government regulation. Poor economic conditions have an unfavorable impact on the demand of customers for loans and the ability of some borrowers to repay these loans. Deterioration in the quality of the credit portfolio could have a material adverse effect on financial condition, results of operations, and ultimately capital.\nFinancial condition and profitability depend on real estate values in our market area.\nBancorp offers a variety of secured loans, including commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, real estate, construction, home equity, consumer and other loans. Bancorp\u2019s loans are secured by real estate (both residential and commercial) primarily in Bancorp\u2019s market area. In instances where borrowers are unable to repay their loans from us and there has been deterioration in the value of the loan collateral, Bancorp could experience higher loan losses which could have a material adverse effect on financial condition, results of operations, and ultimately capital.\nIf actual loan losses are greater than Bancorp\u2019s assumption for loan losses, earnings could decrease.\nBancorp\u2019s loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of these loans, the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to ensure repayment and the wealth of guarantors providing guarantees to support these loans may be insufficient to aid in the repayment of these loans. Accordingly, Bancorp might experience significant credit losses which could have a material adverse effect on operating results. Bancorp makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of collateral for repayment of many loans. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, Bancorp considers, among other factors, an evaluation of economic conditions and Bancorp\u2019s loan loss experience. If Bancorp\u2019s assumptions prove to be incorrect or economic problems are worse than projected, the current allowance may not be sufficient to cover loan losses and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in the loan portfolio. Such additions to the allowance, if necessary, could have a material adverse impact on financial results.\nIn addition, federal and state regulators annually review Bancorp\u2019s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or loan charge-offs. If the regulatory agencies require any increase in the provision for loan losses or loan charge-offs for which Bancorp had not allocated, it would have a negative effect on net income.\nIf we are unable to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that we have reported in this Annual Report, or if other material weaknesses are identified in the future, our results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nAs disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, during the fourth quarter of 2016, we determined that the Company has a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to the operating effectiveness of the Company\u2019s control over the assessment of the appropriateness of loan grades used in the allowance for loan losses estimate, including the completeness and accuracy of the information used to assess the loan grades. No restatement of prior period financial statements, no change in previously released financial results, and no adjustments to the fourth quarter 2016 allowance for loan losses calculation were required as a result of this material weakness in internal control. Management is taking steps to remediate this material weakness by evaluating the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses policies and procedures for and resources allocated to the review control over the assessment of loan grades. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address this material weakness or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nFluctuations in interest rates could reduce profitability.\nOur primary source of income is from the net interest spread, the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Bancorp expects to periodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of Bancorp\u2019s assets and liabilities, meaning that either interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than interest-earning assets, or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates should move contrary to Bancorp\u2019s position, this gap will work against Bancorp and earnings will be negatively affected.\nMany factors affect the fluctuation of market interest rates, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf\ninflation or deflation\n\u25cf\nrecession\n\u25cf\na rise in unemployment\n\u25cf\ntightening money supply\n\u25cf\ninternational disorder and instability in foreign financial markets\n\u25cf\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s actions to control interest rates\nBancorp\u2019s interest rate sensitivity analysis indicates an increase in interest rates of up to 4% would decrease net interest income, primarily because the majority of Bancorp\u2019s variable rate loans have floors of 4% or higher, and are indexed to the prime rate. Since the prime rate is currently 3.75%, rates would have to increase more than 25 bp before the rates on such loans will rise. This negatively impacts the effect of rising rates. Deposit rates generally do not reprice as quickly as loans which negatively affects earnings as rates decline. As rates rise this behavior could benefit the Bancorp short term, but might pose a risk to earnings in the longer term. Migration of deposits out of Bancorp, as customers pursue higher rates, could impact liquidity and earnings as Bancorp competes for deposits. Changes in the mix of deposits could result in increased average rates paid on deposits, and lower earnings to Bancorp. Bancorp\u2019s asset-liability management strategy, which is designed to mitigate risk from changes in market interest rates, may not be able to prevent changes in interest rates from having a material adverse effect on Bancorp\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Bancorp\u2019s most recent earnings simulation model estimated the impact of changing interest rates on earnings for the next 12 months indicates net interest income will decrease approximately 3.7% if interest rates immediately decrease 100 basis points and decrease approximately 0.9% if rates increase 100 basis points.\nSignificant stock market volatility could negatively affect Bancorp\u2019s financial results.\nCapital and credit markets experience volatility and disruption from time to time. These conditions place downward pressure on credit availability, credit worthiness and customers\u2019 inclinations to borrow. Prolonged volatility or a significant disruption could negatively impact customers\u2019 ability to seek new loans or to repay existing loans. The personal wealth of many borrowers and guarantors has historically added a source of financial strength to certain loans and would be negatively impacted by severe market declines. Sustained reliance on their personal assets to make loan payments would result in deterioration of their liquidity, and could result in loan defaults.\nIncome from wealth management and trust constitutes approximately 44% of non-interest income. Trust assets under management are expressed in terms of market value, and a significant portion of fee income is based upon those values. A large majority of wealth management and trust fees are based on market values which generally fluctuate with the overall stock market.\nCompetition with other financial institutions could adversely affect profitability.\nBancorp operates in a highly competitive industry that could become even more so as a result of earnings pressure of contending banks, legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Bancorp faces vigorous competition in price and structure of financial products from banks and other financial institutions. Bancorp also competes with other non-traditional providers of financial services, such as brokerage firms and insurance companies. As internet-based financial services continue to grow in acceptance, Bancorp must remain relevant as a place where consumers and businesses value personal service while our competition offers these services without human interaction. The variety of sources of competition may reduce or limit margins on banking services, reduce market share and adversely affect results of operations and financial condition. Bancorp\u2019s own growth and expansion may adversely affect customer perceptions of the community based, customer oriented service Bancorp provides, thus damaging Bancorp\u2019s image in the market.\nCredit unions continue to grow in popularity and size, and their expansion into business lending is growing. Because credit unions are not subject to federal income tax, and Bancorp pays federal income tax at a marginal rate of 35%, these companies have a significant competitive advantage over Bancorp. This advantage may have a negative impact on Bancorp\u2019s growth and resultant financial results as these credit unions continue to expand.\nDecreased residential mortgage origination, volume and pricing decisions of competitors could affect net income\nBancorp originates, sells and services residential mortgage loans. Changes in interest rates and pricing decisions by our loan competitors affect demand for Bancorp\u2019s residential mortgage loan products, revenue realized on the sale of loans and revenues received from servicing such loans for others, ultimately reducing Bancorp\u2019s net income. New regulations, increased regulatory reviews, and/or changes in structure of secondary mortgage markets which Bancorp utilizes to sell mortgage loans may be introduced and may increase costs and make it more difficult to operate a residential mortgage origination business.\nAn extended disruption of vital infrastructure or a security breach could negatively impact Bancorp\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nBancorp\u2019s operations depend upon, among other things, infrastructure, including equipment and facilities. Extended disruption of vital infrastructure by fire, power loss, natural disaster, telecommunications failure, information systems breaches, terrorist activity or the domestic and foreign response to such activity, or other events outside of Bancorp\u2019s control could have a material adverse impact on the financial services industry as a whole and on Bancorp\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. Bancorp\u2019s business continuity plan may not work as intended or may not prevent significant interruption of operations. Occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or security breaches of information systems could damage Bancorp\u2019s reputation, result in loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have an adverse effect on Bancorp\u2019s financial condition and results of operation.\nBancorp\u2019s assets which are at risk for cyber-attacks include financial assets and non-public information belonging to customers. Cyber security risks include cyber espionage, blackmail, ransom, theft, and corporate account takeovers. Bancorp employs many preventive and detective controls to protect its assets, and provides mandatory recurring information security training to all employees. Bancorp has invested in multiple preventative tools in an attempt to protect our customers from cyber threats and corporate account takeover. Bancorp regularly provides educational information regarding cyber threats to our customers. Bancorp utilizes multiple third-party vendors who have access to our assets via electronic media. While Bancorp requires third parties, many of whom are small companies, to have similar or superior controls in place there is no guarantee that a breach of information could occur.\nBancorp\u2019s credit metrics are at historically strong levels.\nDuring 2016, Bancorp\u2019s solid asset quality metrics trended within a narrow range and exceeded solid benchmarks of the past several years to reach historically strong levels. We realize that present asset quality metrics are exceptionally positive and, recognizing the cyclical nature of the lending business, we know they will normalize over the long term.\nBancorp\u2019s accounting policies and methods are critical to how Bancorp reports its financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.\nAccounting policies and methods are fundamental to how Bancorp records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. Bancorp must exercise judgment in selecting and applying these accounting policies and methods so they comply with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cUS GAAP\u201d).\nBancorp has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management\u2019s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, or reducing a liability. Bancorp has established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently.\nThe policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding Bancorp\u2019s judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, there can be no assurances that actual results will not differ from those estimates. See the \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d in the \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for more information.\nBancorp operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations.\nBancorp is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities. Any change in applicable regulations or federal or state legislation could have a substantial impact on Bancorp and its operations. Additional legislation and regulations may be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect Bancorp\u2019s powers, authority and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on Bancorp\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. The exercise of regulatory power may have a negative impact on Bancorp\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Bank is subject to numerous fair lending laws designed to protect consumers and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations prohibit discriminatory lending practices by financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice, federal banking agencies and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s compliance with fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new lines of business. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations.\nThe Bank faces a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and to file reports such as suspicious activity reports and currency transaction reports. We are required to comply with these and other anti-money laundering requirements. The federal banking agencies and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network are authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the requirement to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations.\nBancorp\u2019s ability to stay current on technological changes in order to compete and meet customer demands is constantly being challenged.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Future success of Bancorp will depend, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional operational efficiencies and greater privacy and security protection for customers and their personal information. Many of Bancorp\u2019s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. Bancorp may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services as quickly as competitors or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Bancorp relies on third party providers for many of its technology-driven banking products and services. Some of these companies have limited financial resources and may be slow to respond with upgrades or enhancements to their products to keep pace with improvements in technology or the introduction of competing products. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could impair Bancorp\u2019s ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business and could have an adverse impact on its business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nBancorp is dependent upon outside third parties for the processing and handling of our records and data.\nWe rely on software developed by third-party vendors to process various transactions. In some cases, we have contracted with third parties to run their proprietary software on our behalf. While we perform a review of controls instituted by the applicable vendors over these programs in accordance with industry standards and perform our own testing of user controls, we rely on the continued maintenance of controls by these third-party vendors, including safeguards over the security of client data. We may incur a temporary disruption in our ability to conduct business or process transactions, or incur damage to our reputation, if the third-party vendor fails to adequately maintain internal controls or institute necessary changes to systems. Such a disruption or breach of security could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, if these third-party service providers experience difficulties, or should terminate their services, and we are unable to replace them with other providers, particularly on a timely basis, our business operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nBancorp may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nBancorp\u2019s success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in the industry and the markets in which we engage can be intense, and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want or need. To attract and retain qualified employees, we must compensate them at market levels. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain our competitive position, our performance, including our competitive position, could suffer, and, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBancorp invests in partnerships that generate federal income tax savings and these may not continue.\nBancorp invests in certain partnerships that yield federal income tax credits resulting in higher net income for Bancorp. These transactions may also include lending to the counterparty, further enhancing the profitability of the transaction. These transactions typically involve a very limited number of counterparties. The availability and suitability of these transactions are not particularly predictable and may not continue to be favorable to Bancorp. Therefore the positive effect on Bancorp\u2019s net income may not continue.", "PERMNO": 79013, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SYBT"}
