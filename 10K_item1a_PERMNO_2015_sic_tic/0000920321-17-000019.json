Risk Factors\nMany factors which affect our business and operations involve risks and uncertainties. The factors described below are some of the risks that could materially harm our business, financial conditions, results of operations or prospects.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and ability to service or refinance our debt, and prevent us from fulfilling our business obligations.\nWe currently have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness, which requires significant principal and interest payments. Approximately $30 million of this indebtedness matures in the next six months. As of our year ended 2016, our total indebtedness was approximately $1.0 billion, principally comprised of $20.5 million outstanding principal amount of 11.5% Notes; $5.5 million outstanding principal amount of 7% Notes; $540.0 million outstanding principal amount of 6.000% senior priority secured notes due 2019, which we refer to as the 6.000% Secured Notes; $81.7 million outstanding principal amount under the ABL Facility; $50.0 million outstanding principal amount of 4% senior secured notes due 2021, which we refer to as the 4% Secured Notes; $241.0 million outstanding principal amount of 8.500% junior priority secured notes due 2022, which we refer to as the 8.500% Notes; and $104.5 million outstanding principal amount of 6.000% senior unsecured notes due 2024, which we refer to as the 6.000% Unsecured Notes.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness and the maturities thereof could also materially adversely affect our future operations, by, for example:\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other business purposes;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy all of our debt obligations, thereby increasing the risk of triggering a cross-default provision;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to economic downturns or other adverse developments relative to less leveraged competitors;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other corporate purposes in the future;\n\u2022\nincreasing our cost of borrowing to satisfy business needs; or\n\u2022\nrequiring refinancing, the successful completion of which cannot be assured.\nOur ability to pay the principal of, or to reduce or refinance, our outstanding indebtedness depends on many factors.\nThe 11.5% Notes and 7% Notes are scheduled to mature in May 2017, the 6.000% Secured Notes are scheduled to mature in August 2019, the ABL Facility is scheduled to mature in June 2021 (with a springing maturity of May 2019 in the event that more than $10 million of the 6.000% Secured Notes remain outstanding at such time), the 4% Secured Notes are scheduled to mature in December 2021, the 8.500% Notes are scheduled to mature in September 2022, and the 6.000% Unsecured Notes are scheduled to mature in May 2024. As noted above, we have called the remaining 11.5% Notes for redemption during the first quarter of 2016 and expect that the remaining $5.5 million of our 7% Notes will be addressed prior to or at maturity in May of 2017, all of which will be made using cash flow from operations or availability under our ABL Facility. Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to reduce or refinance, our indebtedness will depend on our future financial and operating performance, and prevailing market conditions. Further, the use of cash for redemptions and maturities noted above reduces the availability of that cash for ongoing operations and future debt service, which increases the risk that at any time our available cash may be inadequate as needed, which risk would be exacerbated by a downturn in results of operations and cash flow. Our future performance will be affected by the impact of general economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control, including the availability of financing in bank and capital markets. We cannot be certain our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in an amount necessary to service our debt. If we are unable to meet our debt obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to restructure or refinance all, or a portion of, our debt to avoid defaulting on our debt obligations or to meet other business needs. Such a refinancing of our indebtedness could result in higher interest rates, could require us to comply with more onerous covenants further restricting our business operations, could be restricted by another one of our debt instruments outstanding, or refinancing opportunities may not be available at all.\nIn connection with improving our capital structure through a number of initiatives, including working capital improvements, exiting underperforming, non-strategic or other businesses, and taking advantage of strategic refinancing opportunities and attractive leveraged loan and high yield debt market conditions, through the end of 2016 we reduced our outstanding debt and weighted average interest rate, which we believe will result in annual cash interest savings of approximately $40 million in 2017 as compared to 2012. There can be no assurances that these or other expected savings will be realized or that intervening developments will not occur to offset these savings.\nThe terms of our indebtedness impose significant restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants which limit our ability (subject in each case to limited exceptions) to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake restricted payments, including dividends and prepaying indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate or permit certain liens;\n\u2022\nenter into business combinations and asset sale transactions;\n\u2022\nmake investments, including capital expenditures;\n\u2022\namend organizational documents and change accounting methods;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nenter into new businesses.\nThese restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make acquisitions or incur needed capital expenditures, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business\nopportunities which may arise.\nThe ABL Facility also contains a negative covenant restricting dispositions, including dispositions the aggregate book value of which exceeds $35.0 million. Such dispositions are permitted, however, if within 360 days after the receipt of any net proceeds from such dispositions, we apply all of the net proceeds thereof: (i) to be reinvested in our business; (ii) to repay obligations under the ABL Facility under certain circumstances; or (iii) to make an offer to purchase the 6.000% Secured Notes. Each of the indentures governing the 6.000% Secured Notes, 8.500% Notes, 11.5% Notes and 6.000% Unsecured Notes and the indenture and note purchase agreement governing the 4% Secured Notes also contains a negative covenant requiring us to apply any net proceeds from an asset sale: (i) to be reinvested in our business; (ii) to repay certain of our indebtedness; or (iii) to make an offer to purchase the 6.000% Secured Notes, 8.500% Notes, 11.5% Notes, 6.000% Unsecured Notes or 4% Secured Notes, respectively. On January 19, 2016, we completed the sale of our Packaging Business, realizing total net cash proceeds of approximately $89.6 million. We have satisfied the reinvestment requirements set forth in our debt agreements with respect to such net cash proceeds.\nIn addition, the ABL Facility contains a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio with which, under certain circumstances, we must comply on a quarterly basis. Our ability to meet such fixed charge coverage ratio may be affected by events beyond our control, such as further deterioration in general economic conditions. We are also required to provide certain financial information on a quarterly basis. Our failure to maintain the fixed charge coverage ratio or effective internal controls could, in certain circumstances, prevent us from borrowing additional amounts, and could result in a default under the ABL Facility. Such a default could cause the indebtedness outstanding under the ABL Facility, and, by reason of cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, the 6.000% Secured Notes, the 8.500% Notes, the 11.5% Notes, the 6.000% Unsecured Notes, the 4% Secured Notes and the 7% Notes, and any other indebtedness we may then have, to become immediately due and payable for which we would not have sufficient resources to satisfy.\nIf any such defaults occur and if we are unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the ABL Facility, the indentures governing the 6.000% Secured Notes and 8.500% Notes and the indenture and note purchase agreement governing the 4% Secured Notes could initiate a bankruptcy or liquidation proceeding, or proceed against the collateral granted to them which secures that indebtedness. If the lenders under the ABL Facility and/or indentures governing the 6.000% Secured Notes and/or 8.500% Notes and/or the indenture and note purchase agreement governing the 4% Secured Notes were to accelerate the repayment of outstanding borrowings, we would not have sufficient resources to repay our indebtedness.\nIf we are able to incur additional borrowings, such borrowings could further exacerbate our risk exposure from debt.\nOur 8.500% Notes indenture, 6.000% Secured Notes indenture, 6.000% Unsecured Notes indenture, 4% Secured Notes indenture and note purchase agreement, credit agreement governing our ABL Facility and our other debt instruments limit, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional debt. If we are able to incur additional borrowings, the risks associated with our substantial leverage would increase.\nUnited States and global economic conditions have adversely affected us and could continue to adversely affect us.\nThe United States and global economic conditions affect our results of operations and financial position. A significant part of our business relies on our customers\u2019 printing spend. A prolonged downturn in the global economy and an uncertain economic outlook could further reduce the demand for printed materials and related offerings that we provide our customers. Consequently, reductions or delays in our customers\u2019 spending could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We believe any extended economic uncertainty will impact our operating results.\nTo the extent that we make select acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses into our business.\nIn the past, we have grown rapidly through acquisitions. We intend to continue to pursue select acquisition opportunities within our core and niche businesses. To the extent we seek to pursue additional acquisitions, we cannot be certain target businesses will be available on favorable terms or that, if we are able to acquire businesses on favorable terms, we will be able to successfully integrate or profitably manage them. Successfully integrating an acquisition involves minimizing disruptions and efficiently managing substantial changes, some of which may be beyond our control. An acquisition always carries the risk that such changes, including facility and equipment location, management and employee base, policies, philosophies and procedures, could have unanticipated effects, could require more resources than intended and could cause customers to temporarily or permanently seek alternate suppliers. A failure to realize acquisition synergies and savings could negatively impact the results of both our acquired and existing operations. Further, our ability to make acquisitions in the future will be limited by the availability to us of cash for that purpose.\nA decline in our consolidated profitability or profitability within one of our individual reporting units could result in the impairment of assets, including goodwill and other long-lived assets.\nWe have material amounts of goodwill and other long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheet. A decline in expected profitability, particularly the impact of an extended uncertainty in the United States and global economies, could call into question the recoverability of our related goodwill and other long-lived assets and require us to write down or write-off these assets.\nThe industries in which we operate our business are highly competitive and extremely fragmented.\nThe industries in which we compete are highly competitive and extremely fragmented. In the envelope market, we compete primarily with a few multi-plant and many single-plant companies servicing regional and local markets. In the commercial printing market, we compete against a few large, diversified and financially stronger printing companies, as well as smaller regional and local commercial printers, many of which are capable of competing with us on volume, price and production quality. We believe there currently is excess capacity in the industries in which we operate, which has resulted in substantial price competition which may continue as customers put product work out for competitive bid. We are constantly seeking ways to reduce our costs, become more efficient and attract customers. We cannot, however, be certain these efforts will be successful or our competitors will not be more successful in their similar efforts. If we fail to reduce costs and increase productivity, or to meet customer demand for new value-added products, services or technologies, we may face decreased revenues and profit margins in markets where we encounter price competition, which in turn could reduce our cash flow and profitability.\nThe printing business we compete in generally does not have long-term customer agreements, and our printing operations may be subject to quarterly and cyclical fluctuations.\nThe printing industry in which we compete is generally characterized by individual orders from customers or short-term contracts. A significant portion of our customers are not contractually obligated to purchase products or services from us. Most customer orders are for specific printing jobs, and repeat business largely depends on our customers\u2019 satisfaction with our work product. Although our business does not depend on any one customer or group of customers, we cannot be sure that any particular customer will continue to do business with us for any period of time. In addition, the timing of particular jobs or types of jobs at particular times of year may cause significant fluctuations in the operating results of our operations in any given quarter. We depend to some extent on sales to certain industries, such as the financial services, advertising, pharmaceutical, automotive and office products industries. To the extent these industries experience downturns, the results of our operations may be adversely affected.\nFactors affecting the United States Postal Service can impact demand for our products.\nPostal costs are a significant component of many of our customers\u2019 cost structure. Historically, increases in postal rates have resulted in reductions in the volume of mail sent, including direct mail, which is a meaningful portion of our envelope volume. As postal rate increases in the United States are outside our control, we can provide no assurance that any future increases in United States postal rates will not have a negative effect on the level of mail sent or the volume of envelopes purchased.\nFactors other than postal rates which affect the volume of mail sent through the United States postal system may also negatively affect our business. Congress enacted a federal \"Do Not Call\" registry in response to consumer backlash against telemarketers. If similar legislation becomes enacted for direct mail advertisers, our business could be adversely affected. Additionally, the United States Postal Service has also indicated the potential need to reduce delivery days. We can provide no assurance that such a change would not impact our customers\u2019 decisions to use direct mail products, which may in turn cause a decrease in our revenues and profitability; however, we do not expect such an impact.\nThe availability of the internet and other electronic media may adversely affect our business.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the demand for envelopes sent through the mail. Such demand comes from utility companies, banks and other financial institutions, among other companies. Our printing business also depends upon demand for printed advertising among other products. Consumers increasingly use the internet and other electronic media to purchase goods and services, and for other purposes, such as paying bills and obtaining electronic versions of printed product. The level of acceptance of electronic media by consumers as well as the extent that consumers are replacing traditional printed reading materials with internet hosted media content or e-reading devices is difficult to predict. Advertisers use the internet and other electronic media for targeted campaigns directed at specific electronic user groups. We cannot be certain the acceleration of the trend towards electronic media will not cause a decrease in the demand for our products. If demand for our products decreases, our cash flow or profitability could materially decrease.\nIncreases in paper costs and any decreases in the availability of our raw materials could have a material effect on our business.\nPaper costs represent a significant portion of our cost of materials. Changes in paper pricing generally do not affect the operating margins of our commercial printing business, because the transactional nature of the business allows us to pass on most announced increases in paper prices to our customers. However, our ability to pass on increases in paper prices is dependent upon the competitive environment at any given time. Paper pricing also affects the operating margins of our envelope business. We have historically been less successful in immediately passing on such paper price increases due to several factors, including contractual restrictions in certain cases and the inability to quickly update catalog prices in other instances. Moreover, rising paper costs, and their consequent impact on our pricing, could lead to a decrease in demand for our products.\nWe depend on the availability of paper in manufacturing most of our products. During periods of tight paper supply, many paper producers allocate shipments of paper based on the historical purchase levels of customers. In the past, we have occasionally experienced minor delays in delivery. Any future delay in availability could negatively impact our cash flow and profitability.\nIncreases in energy and transportation costs could have a material effect on our business.\nEnergy and transportation costs represent a large portion of our overall cost structure. Increases in the costs of these inputs may increase our overall costs. We may not be able to pass these costs on to our customers through higher prices. Increases in the cost of materials may adversely impact our customers\u2019 demand for our products.\nWe depend on good labor relations.\nAs of our year ended 2016, we employed approximately 7,300 people worldwide, approximately 23% of whom were members of various local labor unions. If our unionized employees were to engage in a concerted strike or other work stoppage, or if other employees were to become unionized, we could experience a disruption of operations, higher labor costs or both. A lengthy strike could result in a material decrease in our cash flow or profitability.\nEnvironmental laws may affect our business.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharge, waste generation, handling, management and disposal, and remediation of contaminated sites. Currently unknown environmental conditions or matters at our existing and prior facilities, new laws and regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws and regulations could result in increased compliance or remediation costs which, if substantial, could have a material effect on our business or operations in the future.\nWe are dependent on key management personnel.\nOur success will depend to a significant degree on our executive officers and other key management personnel. We cannot be certain we will be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel, or attract additional qualified management in the future. In addition, the success of any acquisitions we may pursue may depend, in part, on our ability to retain management personnel of the acquired companies. We do not carry key person insurance on any of our managerial personnel.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by any failure, interruption or security lapse of our information technology systems.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems to process transactions, manage inventory, purchase, sell and ship goods on a timely basis and maintain cost-efficient operations. We use information systems to support decision making and to monitor business performance. Our information technology systems depend on global communications providers, telephone systems, hardware, software and other aspects of internet infrastructure which can experience significant system failures and outages. Our systems are susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems are vulnerable to computer viruses and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our systems. In addition, cybersecurity threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches which could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. The occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information technology systems and inhibit internal operations, the ability to provide customer service or provide management with accurate financial and operational information essential for making decisions at various levels of management.", "PERMNO": 82266, "SIC": 2670, "TIC": "CVOVQ"}
