{"cik": "844143", "company": "Differential Brands Group Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our operating results, our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report.\nWe are bound by the New Credit Agreements, which contain restrictive covenants that may limit our operational flexibility. Furthermore, if we default on our obligations under the New Credit Agreements, our operations may be interrupted and our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe are bound by the New Credit Agreements. The New Credit Agreements include covenants that restrict our ability to do the following: incur indebtedness; create liens; consolidate, merge, liquidate or dissolve; sell, lease or otherwise transfer any assets; substantially change the nature of the business; make investments or acquisitions; pay dividends; enter into transactions with affiliates; amend material documents, prepay indebtedness and make capital expenditures. The New Credit Agreements also require us to comply with financial maintenance covenants. The Term Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with financial maintenance covenants to be tested quarterly (beginning with the second fiscal quarter ending after the Closing Date), consisting of an adjustable maximum net senior leverage ratio that is initially 5.29 to 1.00, a maximum net senior rent adjusted leverage ratio that is initially 4.20 to 1.00 and an adjustable minimum fixed charge coverage ratio that is initially 1.56 to 1.00. The ABL Credit Agreement requires us to comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1:00 to 1:00 to be tested monthly if excess availability under the Revolving Facility is less than 10% of the lesser of the commitments under the Revolving Facility and the borrowing base or during specified events of defaults. In addition, substantially all of our assets, including our trademarks, secure our obligations under the New Credit Agreements.\nThe restrictive covenants contained in the New Credit Agreements and the degree to which we are leveraged following the Merger Transactions could have important consequences to the our shareholders, including, but not limited to, potentially:\n\u2022 reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness;\n\u2022 making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and changes in our business;\n\u2022 increasing borrowing costs and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate requirements;\n\u2022 requiring the dedication of a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes;\n\u2022 restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; and\n\u2022 making it more difficult for us to repay, refinance, or satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt.\nIn addition, any failure by us to comply with the various covenants could have material adverse consequences. Such noncompliance may result in our inability to borrow under the New Credit Agreements, which we utilize to access our working capital, and as a result may adversely affect our ability to finance our operations or pursue any expansion plans. An event of default under the New Credit Agreements could also result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. If the financing under the New Credit Agreements or other material indebtedness becomes due and payable, we may be required to refinance, restructure, or otherwise amend some or all of such obligations, sell assets, or raise additional cash through the sale of our equity. We cannot make any assurances that we would be able to obtain such refinancing in a timely manner, on favorable terms or at all or that such restructuring activities, sales of assets, or issuances of equity can be accomplished or, if accomplished, would raise sufficient funds to meet these obligations. Additionally, upon the occurrence of an \"event of default\" under the New Credit Agreements, all of our assets could be subject to liquidation by the creditors, which liquidation could result in no assets being left for our stockholders the creditors receive their required payment.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial performance and impact our ability to service our indebtedness.\nAfter giving effect to the Merger and the related Merger Transactions and the incurrence of indebtedness in connection therewith, we have approximately $82.5 million in indebtedness, including $56.0 million of indebtedness under the New Credit Agreements and $16.5 million of indebtedness under the Modified Convertible Notes.\nIf we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt obligations, will increase. The degree to which we, together with our subsidiaries, are leveraged or incur additional debt could have important consequences to our ability to meet debt obligations. For example, the degree of our consolidated leverage:\n\u2022 may limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or general corporate purposes, particularly if, as discussed further in the following risk factors, (1) the ratings assigned to our debt securities by nationally recognized credit rating organizations are revised downward or (2) we seek capital during periods of turbulent or unsettled market conditions;\n\u2022 may require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal on our debt, reducing the funds available to us for other purposes, including acquisitions, capital expenditures, marketing and other growth initiatives;\n\u2022 may increase our future borrowing costs;\n\u2022 may limit our flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions as compared to our competitors;\n\u2022 may put us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that are not as leveraged;\n\u2022 may increase the risk that third parties will be unwilling or unable to engage in hedging or other financial or commercial arrangements with us;\n\u2022 may increase the risk that we will need to sell securities or assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, or take other unfavorable actions to meet payment obligations; or\n\u2022 may increase the risk that we will not meet the financial covenants contained in our current or future debt agreements or timely make all required debt payments.\nOur ability to make cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate significant operating cash flow in the future. This ability is, to a significant extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that will be beyond our control.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. In any such circumstance, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments. Any such action, if necessary, may not be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The instruments governing our indebtedness may restrict our ability to sell assets and our use of the proceeds from such sales.\nTo service our indebtedness incurred in connection with the Merger, we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness incurred in connection with the Merger and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate significant operating cash flow in the future. This ability is, to a significant extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that will be beyond our control.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. In any such circumstance, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot service its indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments. Any such action, if necessary, may not be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The instruments governing our indebtedness may restrict our ability to sell assets and our use of the proceeds from such sales.\nOur success will further depend on implementing a shift in Hudson's denim production from primarily domestic production to foreign production.\nThe Hudson\u00ae brand has historically produced substantially all of its denim apparel in Los Angeles, California. Our ability to improve operational efficiencies and profitability will depend in part upon the successful implementation of shifting all or substantially all of Hudson's\u00ae denim production to Mexico, Turkey and other foreign countries to achieve better production costs and margin improvement. To date, only a minor portion of Hudson's production has been shifted to Mexico, Turkey and other foreign countries. There are risks and uncertainties when undertaking large-scale changes in denim production and sourcing, particularly in a foreign country. There can be no assurances that such a large-scale move will not affect the fit, quality or construction or timely deliveries to retailers of our Hudson\u00ae branded denim.\nOur success will further depend on customer reception to Hudson producing non-United States denim products.\nWe were successful in making the transition from domestic production to Mexico production for our former Joe's\u00ae branded products, and saw negligible, if any, negative reaction from our customers, who came to accept the Joe's\u00ae branded products regardless of where they were produced. However, Hudson has different brand awareness amongst its loyal customers and has historically produced substantially all of its denim in the United States therefore, we may experience negative reaction from the Hudson\u00ae customer base and negative reception for denim not produced in the United States.\nProblems with the third party distribution system could harm our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve targeted operating efficiencies.\nThe Hudson\u00ae brand and the Robert Graham\u00ae brand rely on distribution facilities operated by third parties. Our ability to meet the needs of our wholesale partners and our own retail stores depends on the proper operation of these distribution facilities. These third parties will continue to provide distribution services, until we elect to terminate such services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into other contracts for alternate or replacement distribution centers on acceptable terms or at all. Such an event could disrupt our operations. In addition, because substantially all of our Hudson\u00ae brand products are distributed from one location and our Robert Graham\u00ae brand products are distributed from a limited number of locations, our operations could also be interrupted by labor difficulties, or by floods, fires, earthquakes or other natural disasters near such facilities. We maintain business interruption insurance; however, this coverage may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions to our distribution system. If we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve targeted operating efficiencies could be harmed. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space, are generally subject to long-term non-cancelable leases and are required to make substantial lease payments under our operating leases, and any failure to make these lease payments when due would likely harm our business, profitability and results of operations.\nWe do not own any of our retail stores, but instead lease all of our retail stores under retail store leases and are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing real estate. Our leases associated with the Robert Graham Business generally have terms of 10 years with no option to renew. The leases associated with the Robert Graham Business are generally terminable after three to five years, and all leases have restrictions in connection with assigning or subletting them. All of our leases require a fixed annual rent, and most require the payment of additional \"percentage\" rent if store sales exceed a negotiated amount. Most of the retail store leases are \"net\" leases, which require us to pay all of the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. Additionally, certain of the leases may allow the lessor to terminate the lease or not renew if we do not achieve a specified gross sales threshold in a particular year. We cannot assure you that we will achieve any of these thresholds. Any loss of our store locations due to underperformance may harm our results of operations, stock price and reputation.\nAdditional sites that we lease are likely to be subject to similar long-term leases. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term if we cannot negotiate a mutually acceptable termination payment. In addition, as our leases expire, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations. If we are unable to enter into new leases or renew existing leases on terms acceptable to us or be released from our obligations\nunder leases for stores that we close, our business, profitability and results of operations may be harmed.\nOur ability to attract customers to our stores depends heavily on successfully locating our stores in suitable locations and any impairment of a store location, including any decrease in customer traffic, could cause our sales to be less than expected.\nOur approach to identifying locations for our retail stores typically favors street and mall locations near premium and contemporary retailers that we believe are consistent with our key customers' demographics and shopping preferences. Sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the volume of foot traffic in these locations. Changes in areas around our existing retail locations that result in reductions in customer foot traffic or otherwise render the locations unsuitable could cause our sales to be less than expected and the related leases are generally non-cancelable. Store locations may become unsuitable due to, and our sales volume and customer traffic generally may be harmed by, among other things:\n\u2022 economic downturns in a particular area;\n\u2022 competition from nearby retailers selling similar apparel;\n\u2022 changing consumer demographics in a particular market;\n\u2022 changing preferences of consumers in a particular market;\n\u2022 the closing or decline in popularity of other businesses located near our store; and\n\u2022 store impairments due to acts of God, natural disasters, climate change or terrorism.\nOur ability to successfully open and operate new retail stores depends on many factors, including, among others, our ability to:\n\u2022 identify new markets where our products and brand image will be accepted or the performance of our retail stores will be successful;\n\u2022 obtain desired locations, including store size and adjacencies, in targeted malls or streets;\n\u2022 negotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired rent and tenant improvement allowances, to secure suitable store locations;\n\u2022 achieve brand awareness, affinity and purchase intent in the new markets;\n\u2022 hire, train and retain store associates and field management;\n\u2022 assimilate new store associates and field management into our corporate culture;\n\u2022 source and supply sufficient inventory levels; and\n\u2022 successfully integrate new retail stores into our existing operations and information technology systems.\nAs of February 29, 2016, we had 30 Robert Graham\u00ae brand stores, which consisted of 18 full price stores and 12 outlet stores. Two additional leases for Robert Graham\u00ae brand full price stores have been signed for 2016 openings. Our new stores may not be immediately profitable and we may incur losses until these stores become profitable. Lack of availability, of desired store locations, delays in the acquisition or opening of new stores, delays or costs resulting from a decrease in commercial development due to capital restraints, difficulties in staffing and operating new store locations or a lack of customer acceptance of stores in new market areas may negatively impact our new store growth and the costs or the profitability associated with new stores. Other than the two Robert Graham\u00ae brand stores mentioned above, there can be no assurance that we will open new stores in fiscal 2016 or thereafter. Any failure to successfully open and operate new stores may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may be unable to grow comparable store sales or average sales per square foot in our retail stores, which could cause our share price to decline.\nWe may not be able to grow our comparable store sales or average sales per square foot in our retail stores. If our future comparable store sales or average sales per square foot decline or fail to meet market expectations, the price of our common stock could decline. In addition, the aggregate results of operations through our wholesale partners and at our retail locations have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. The continued operation of our retail locations depends on our ability to hire, train and retain associates and field management. A variety of factors affect both comparable store sales and average sales per square foot, including, among others, consumer spending patterns, fashion trends, competition, current economic conditions, pricing, inflation, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our product assortment, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions. If we misjudge the market for our products, we may incur excess inventory for some of our products and miss opportunities for other products. These factors may cause our comparable store sales results and average sales per square foot in the future to be materially lower than recent periods or our expectations, which could harm our results of operations and result in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nUncertain economic conditions in the United States and other parts of the world can affect consumer confidence and consumer spending patterns.\nThe general economy in the United States and abroad continues to be in the midst of uncertainty. The apparel industry has historically been subject to cyclical variations, recessions in the general economy or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits which could negatively impact our business overall, the carrying value of our tangible and intangible assets, sales, gross margins and profitability. Our business depends on the general economic environment and levels of consumer spending that affect not only the ultimate consumer, but also retailers, our largest direct customers. Purchases of high-fashion apparel and accessories tend to decline in periods of recession or uncertainty regarding future economic prospects, when consumer spending, particularly on discretionary items, and disposable income decline. Many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel industry, including, among others: prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, energy costs, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. During periods of recession or economic uncertainty, we may not be able to maintain or increase our sales to existing customers, make sales to new customers, open and operate new retail stores, or maintain or improve our earnings from operations as a percentage of net sales. Additionally, the strength of the United States dollar relative to foreign currencies cam impact the demand for our products by foreign tourists, as has been experienced in recent periods. As a result, our operating results may be adversely and materially affected by downward trends in the United States or global economy.\nEconomic conditions have also led to a highly promotional environment and strong discounting pressure from both our wholesale partners and retail customers, which could lead to a negative impact on our revenues and profitability. This promotional environment may continue even after economic growth returns, as we expect consumer spending trends are expected to remain at historically depressed levels for the foreseeable future. The domestic and international political situation also affects consumer confidence. The threat, outbreak or escalation of terrorism, military conflicts, civil unrest or other hostilities around the world could lead to further decreases in consumer spending.\nWe face risks associated with constantly changing fashion trends, including consumer's response to our products. Also, we intend to expand into other product classifications. If we are unable to adapt to changing fashion trends as to our existing or new products, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge and respond to changing consumer demand and fashion trends in a timely manner, both as to existing products and as to other product classifications we may initiate. Any failure on our part to anticipate, identify and respond effectively to changing consumer demands and fashion trends could adversely affect the acceptance of our existing or new products and leave us with a substantial amount of unsold inventory or missed opportunities in the marketplace. If that occurs, we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess, slow-moving inventory, which may negatively affect our ability to achieve profitability. At the same time, a focus on tight management of inventory may result, from time to time, in our not having an adequate supply of products to meet consumer demand and may cause us to lose sales.\nWe attempt to minimize our risk associated with delivering items through early order commitments by retailers. Accordingly, we generally place production orders with manufacturers before we have received all of a season's orders and orders may be cancelled by retailers before shipment. Therefore, if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to consumer preferences, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories or lower profit margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business and results of operations could be negatively impacted by a change in consumer demand for denim and premium lifestyle apparel in the marketplace.\nBecause consumer demands and fashion trends are subject to cyclical variations as well as the fact that the general economy and future economic prospects can often affect consumer spending habits, a change in any one of the following:\n\u2022 consumer demand,\n\u2022 consumer purchases of discretionary items,\n\u2022 general economic conditions, or\n\u2022 fashion trends,\nmay result in lower sales, excess inventories or lower profit margins for our Hudson\u00ae or Robert Graham\u00ae products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results operations and financial condition.\nWe face intense competition in the denim and premium lifestyle apparel industries. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nWe face a variety of competitive challenges from other domestic and foreign fashion-oriented apparel producers, some of whom may be significantly larger and more diversified and have greater financial and marketing resources than we have. We do not currently hold a dominant competitive position in any market. Our Hudson\u00ae brand competes with other denim manufacturers such as AG, Paige Premium Denim, Rag and Bone, Seven for All Mankind, Citizens of Humanity, J Brand and True Religion and other larger competitors. Our Robert Graham\u00ae brand competes with other premium lifestyle brands such as Armani, Burberry, Hugo Boss, John Varvatos, Paul Smith, Peter Millar, Ralph Lauren, Ted Baker, Theory, Tommy Bahama, Zegna and other larger competitors. We compete primarily on the basis of:\n\u2022 anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a timely manner,\n\u2022 maintaining favorable brand recognition,\n\u2022 developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors and styles that appeal to consumers,\n\u2022 appropriately pricing products,\n\u2022 providing strong and effective marketing support,\n\u2022 creating an acceptable value proposition for retail customers,\n\u2022 ensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain efficiencies with manufacturers and retailers, and\n\u2022 obtaining sufficient retail floor space and effective presentation of our products at retail.\nFurthermore, some of our competitors are larger and may have resources available to them that we do not have or are privately held without the restraint of a public company and with limited reporting of their results of operations. Therefore, it may be difficult for us to effectively gauge consumer response to our products and how our products are competing with these and other competitors in the marketplace. We cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business depends on a strong brand image, and if we are not able to maintain or enhance our brand, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition, we may be unable to sell sufficient quantities of our merchandise, which would harm our business and cause our results of operations to suffer.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to maintaining and expanding our customer base. Maintaining and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as visual merchandising, marketing and advertising, employee training and store operations. We anticipate that, as our business expands into new markets and new product classifications and further penetrates existing markets, and as the markets in which we operate become increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Certain of our competitors in the apparel industry have faced adverse publicity surrounding the quality, attributes and performance of their products. Our brand may similarly be adversely affected if our public image or reputation is tarnished by failing to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity. Any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to be a leader in the contemporary apparel industry and to continue to provide high quality products. If we are unable to maintain or enhance our brand image, our results of operations may suffer and our business may be harmed.\nA substantial portion of our net sales and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers, and the loss of any of these large customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Hudson Business is substantially dependent on its 10 largest customers and customer groups, which accounted for approximately 72 percent and 70 percent of net sales for our Hudson Business during fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. The largest customer for our Hudson Business, Nordstrom, Inc., accounted for over 34 percent and 40 percent of our net sales in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our Robert Graham\u00ae brand is substantially dependent on its 10 largest customers and customer groups, which accounted for approximately 35 percent and 42 percent of net sales for our Robert Graham Business during fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. Nordstrom, Inc., which is also the largest customer of our Robert Graham Business, accounted for over 11 percent and 13 percent of net sales for our Robert Graham Business in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. We do not enter into any type of long-term agreements or firm commitment orders with any of our customers. Instead, we enter\ninto a number of individual purchase order commitments with our customers. A decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, including our limited number of private label customers, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease the amount of merchandise purchased from us, to change their manner of doing business with us, to cancel orders previously placed in advance of shipment dates or a decision to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur plans to improve and expand our product offerings may not be successful, and the implementation of these plans may divert our operational, managerial and administrative resources, which could harm our competitive position and reduce our net revenue and profitability.\nWe plan to grow our business by increasing our core product offerings, which includes expanding our Hudson\u00ae brand and Robert Graham\u00ae brand product collection, including into new product classifications. We will continue to evaluate our plan to develop and introduce select new product categories and pursue select additional licensing opportunities in other categories.\nIf our expected product offerings fail to maintain and enhance our brand identity, our image may be diminished or diluted. The expansion into new products and classifications may require the establishment of new sourcing relationships, increasing our sourcing risk. See \"Risk Factors-Problems with sourcing, along with the extent of our foreign sourcing, may adversely affect our business.\" As we expand our licensing activities, we increase risks associated with having a limited ability to conduct comprehensive final quality checks on merchandise, which could affect product quality.\nIn addition, our ability to successfully carry out our plans to improve and expand our product offerings may be affected by economic and competitive conditions, changes in consumer spending patterns and changes in consumer preferences and style trends. These plans could be abandoned, could cost more than anticipated and could divert resources from other areas of our business, any of which could impact our competitive position and reduce our net revenue and profitability.\nOur licensing arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions of third parties who may not comply with our product quality, manufacturing standards, marketing and other requirements, which may have an adverse effect on our brand equity, reputation or business.\nWe license our Hudson\u00ae to third parties for manufacturing, marketing and distribution of children's products. Additionally, we license trademarks associated with our Robert Graham\u00ae brand to third parties for manufacturing, marketing and distribution of apparel and accessories. We believe that licensing our brands for certain product categories will broaden and enhance the products available under these brand names.\nOur licensing arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions of third parties over whom we have limited control. We have entered into one license agreement for our Hudson\u00ae brand: children's. We have entered into certain license agreements for our Robert Graham\u00ae brand: men's dress shirts, neckwear, tailored clothing, hosiery, leather goods (including bags and belts and small leathers), sun and optical eyewear, headwear, jewelry, footwear, underwear and loungewear and fragrances. In the future, we may enter into select additional licensing arrangements for product offerings which require specialized expertise. We may also enter into select licensing agreements pursuant to which we may grant third parties the right to distribute and sell our products in certain geographic areas.\nAlthough we have taken and will continue to take steps to select potential licensing partners carefully and to monitor the activities of our licensing partners (through, among other things, approval rights over product design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, marketing, distribution and advertising), such arrangements may not be successful. Our licensing partners may fail to fulfill their\nobligations under their license agreements or have interests that differ from or conflict with our own, such as the pricing of our products and the offering of competitive products. In addition, the risks applicable to the business of our licensing partners may be different than the risks applicable to our business, including risks associated with each such partner's ability to:\n\u2022 obtain capital;\n\u2022 exercise operational and financial control over its business;\n\u2022 manage its labor relations;\n\u2022 maintain relationships with suppliers;\n\u2022 manage its credit and bankruptcy risks; and\n\u2022 maintain customer relationships.\nAny of the foregoing risks, or the inability of any of our licensing partners to successfully market our products or otherwise conduct the licensing partners' business, may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations and reputation in regions or product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements.\nIf we are unable to accurately forecast customer demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to deliver products to meet our requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of products to our stores and to wholesale partners.\nWe stock our stores, and provide inventory to our wholesale partners, based on our or our wholesale partners' estimates of future demand for particular products. Our inventory management and production planning team determines the number of pieces of each product that we will order from our manufacturers based upon past sales of similar products, sales trend information and anticipated demand at our suggested retail prices. However, if our inventory and planning team fails to accurately forecast customer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage our inventory or production at a level appropriate for future customer demand.\nFactors that could affect our inventory management and production planning team's ability to accurately forecast customer demand for our products include:\n\u2022 a substantial increase or decrease in demand for our products or for products of our competitors;\n\u2022 our failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance for our new products;\n\u2022 new product introductions or pricing strategies by competitors;\n\u2022 more limited historical store sales information for our newer products and markets;\n\u2022 weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in the future; and\n\u2022 acts or threats of war or terrorism or civil unrest which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or our international sales.\nIf we were to experience rapid growth, we may place insufficient levels of desirable product with our wholesale partners and in our retail locations such that we would be unable to fully satisfy customer demand at those locations. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to match supply with demand in all cases in the future, whether as a result of our inability to produce sufficient levels of desirable product or our failure to forecast demand accurately. As a result of these inabilities or failures, we may encounter difficulties in filling customer orders or in liquidating excess inventory at discount prices and may experience significant write-offs. Additionally, if we over-produce a product\nbased on an aggressive forecast of demand, retailers may not be able to sell the product and cancel future orders or require give backs. These outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and adversely impact sales, gross margins and profitability.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by the financial health of our retail customers.\nWe sell our products primarily to retail and distribution companies around the world based on pre-qualified payment terms. Financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to curtail business with that customer. We may also assume more credit risk relating to that customer's receivables. We are dependent primarily on lines of credit that we establish from time to time with customers, and should a substantial number of customers become unable to pay to us their respective debts as they become due, we may be unable to collect some or all of the monies owed by those customers. In particular, because of the concentration of our customer and customer groups, our results of operations could be adversely affected if any one of these customers fails to satisfy its payments obligations to us when due.\nIn recent years, the retail industry has experienced consolidation, restructurings, reorganizations and other ownership changes that have resulted in one entity controlling several different stores or the elimination of stores. This consolidation can result in fewer customers for our products or the closing of some stores or the number of \"doors\" which carry our products. As a result, the potential for consolidation or ownership changes, closing of retail outlets and fewer customers could negatively impact sales of our products and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to manage our operations at our current size or are unable to manage any future growth effectively, our business results and financial performance may suffer.\nWe have made and are making investments to support our near and longer-term growth. If our operations continue to grow over the longer term, of which there can be no assurance, we will be required to expand our sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, to upgrade our management information systems and other processes, and to obtain more space for our expanding administrative support and other headquarters personnel. The integration of our Hudson Business and our Robert Graham Business could strain our existing resources. As a result, we could experience operating difficulties, including obtaining sufficient raw materials at acceptable prices, securing manufacturing capacity to produce our products and experiencing delays in production and shipments. These difficulties would likely lead to a decrease in net revenue, income from operations and the price of our common stock, and such decreases could be significant.\nProblems with sourcing, along with the extent of our foreign sourcing, may adversely affect our business.\nOur products are primarily produced by, and purchased or procured from, independent manufacturing contractors, many of whom are located outside of the United States. For fiscal 2015, substantially all of the total revenue for the Robert Graham Business was attributable to manufacturing contractors located outside of the United States, with approximately 92 percent of Robert Graham's purchases for fiscal 2015 attributable to manufacturing contractors located in Asia, including India. For fiscal 2015, 51 percent of the total revenue for the Hudson Business was attributable to manufacturing contractors located outside of the United States, with approximately 45 percent of Hudson's purchases attributable to manufacturing contractors located in Mexico. We anticipate that the percentage of our total combined revenue sourced from outside of the United States for fiscal 2015 will increase because of our plan to shift a substantial portion of Hudson's denim production to Mexico, Turkey and other foreign countries. A manufacturing contractor's failure to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet the required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items. The failure to make timely deliveries may cause customers to cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reduced prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect\non us. As a result of the magnitude of our foreign sourcing, our business is subject to the following risks:\n\u2022 political and economic instability in countries or regions, including heightened terrorism and other security concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to additional or more frequent inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods;\n\u2022 imposition of regulations, quotas and other trade restrictions relating to imports, including quotas imposed by bilateral textile agreements between the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022 imposition of increased duties, taxes and other charges on imports;\n\u2022 labor union strikes at ports through which our products enter the United States;\n\u2022 labor shortages in countries where contractors and suppliers are located;\n\u2022 a significant decrease in availability or an increase in the cost of raw materials;\n\u2022 restrictions on the transfer of funds to or from foreign countries;\n\u2022 disease epidemics and health-related concerns, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials, and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;\n\u2022 the migration and development of manufacturing contractors, which could affect where our products are or planned to be produced;\n\u2022 increases in the costs of fuel, travel and transportation;\n\u2022 reduced manufacturing flexibility because of geographic distance between our foreign manufacturers and us, increasing the risk that we may have to mark down unsold inventory as a result of misjudging the market for a foreign- made product; and\n\u2022 violations by foreign contractors of labor and wage standards and resulting adverse publicity.\nIf these risks limit or prevent us from manufacturing products in any significant international market, prevent us from acquiring products from foreign suppliers, or significantly increase the cost of our products, our operations could be seriously disrupted until alternative suppliers are found or alternative markets are developed, which could negatively impact our business.\nWe do not have written agreements with any of our third-party manufacturing contractors. As a result, any single manufacturing contractor could unilaterally terminate its relationship with us at any time. Supply disruptions from any of our third-party manufacturing contractors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demands, if we are unable to source suitable replacement materials in a timely manner, at acceptable prices or at all. Our inability to promptly replace manufacturing contractors that terminate their relationships with us or cease to provide high quality products in a timely and cost- efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur business could suffer as a result of a manufacturer's inability to produce our goods on time and to our specifications or if we need to replace manufacturers.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent third parties for the manufacture of all of our products. We enter into a number of purchase order commitments each season specifying a time for delivery, method of payment, design and quality specifications and other standard industry provisions, but do not have long-term contracts with any manufacturer. None of the manufacturers we use produces our products exclusively. The inability of a certain manufacturer to ship orders of our products in a timely manner or to meet our quality\nstandards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items, which could result in cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries or a reduction in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Because of the seasonality of our business, and the apparel and fashion business in particular, the dates on which customers need and require shipments of products from us are critical, as styles and consumer tastes change so rapidly in the apparel and fashion business, particularly from one season to the next. Further, because quality is a leading factor when customers and retailers accept or reject goods, any decline in quality by our third-party manufacturers could be detrimental not only to a particular order, but also to our future relationship with that particular customer.\nWe compete with other companies for the production capacity of our manufacturers. Some of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, and thus may have an advantage in the competition for production and import quota capacity. If we experience a significant increase in demand, or if an existing manufacturer of ours must be replaced, we may have to expand our third-party manufacturing capacity. We cannot provide assurance that this additional capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or similar to any existing terms which we have with our manufacturers, either from a production standpoint or a financial standpoint.\nIf an independent manufacturer of ours fails to use acceptable labor practices, our business could suffer.\nWhile we require our independent manufacturers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we have no control over the ultimate actions of our independent manufacturers. Despite our lack of control, we have internal and vendor operating guidelines to promote ethical business practices and our staff periodically visits and monitors the operations of our independent manufacturers. We also use the services of a third party independent labor consulting service to conduct on site audits as required by state labor laws to help minimize our risk and exposure to unacceptable labor practice violations. The violation of labor or other laws by one of our independent manufacturers or the divergence of an independent manufacturer's labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States, could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation. Any of these, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In particular, the laws governing garment manufacturers in the State of California impose joint liability upon us and our independent manufacturers for the labor practices of those independent manufacturers. As a result, should one of our independent manufacturers be found in violation of state labor laws, we could suffer adverse financial or other unforeseen adverse consequences.\nIncreases in the price of raw materials or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods and decrease our profitability.\nThe principal fabrics used in our business are cotton, blends, synthetics and wools. The prices we pay our suppliers for our products are dependent in part on the market price for the raw materials-primarily cotton-used to produce them. The price and availability of cotton may fluctuate substantially, depending on a variety of factors, including demand, crop yields, weather, supply conditions, transportation costs, work stoppages, government regulation, economic climates and other unpredictable factors. Increases in raw material costs, together with other factors, could result in a decrease of our profitability unless we are able to pass higher prices on to our customers. Moreover, any decrease in the availability of cotton could impair our ability to meet our production requirements in a timely manner, which could adversely affects our revenues and working capital requirements.\nWe are dependent on our relationships with our vendors.\nWe purchase our raw materials, including fabric, yarns, threads and trims, such as zippers, buttons and tags from a variety of vendors. While we are not reliant exclusively on one or more particular vendor for the supply of the raw materials or component parts required to meet our manufacturing needs, we depend on our relationships and these vendors to ensure our supply of these raw materials or component parts. Any problems or disputes with these vendors could result in us having to source these raw materials or component parts from another vendor, which could delay production, and in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to heightened cybersecurity risks and may incur an increase in costs in an effort to minimize those risks.\nWe utilize systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, employees, and others, including credit card information and personal identification information. A security breach may expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly- evolving types of cyber-attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our customers, or others who have entrusted us with information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. In addition, data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including breach by us or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. Any compromise or breach of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.\nAny potential future acquisitions, strategic investments or mergers may subject us to significant risks, any of which may harm our business and may lead to substantial dilution or negative effects on the market price of our common stock.\nThe combined company's strategy includes identifying and acquiring, investing in or merging with suitable candidates on acceptable terms in order to grow or complement our business. Acquisitions would involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:\n\u2022 diversion of management attention from running our existing business;\n\u2022 possible material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022 increased expenses including legal, administrative and compensation expenses related to newly hired employees;\n\u2022 increased costs to integrate the technology, personnel, customer base and business practices of the acquired company with us;\n\u2022 potential exposure to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process, including cyber security risks;\n\u2022 potential adverse effects on our reported operating results due to possible write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with acquisitions;\n\u2022 acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all; and\n\u2022 any acquired business, technology, service or product may significantly under-perform relative to our expectations, and we may not achieve the benefits we expect from the acquisition.\nFor any or all of these reasons, our pursuit of an acquisition, investment or merger may cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. In addition, the success of our strategy to pursue potential future acquisitions will depend on our ability to achieve savings from the elimination of duplicative expenses or the realization of other efficiencies associated with such acquisitions. Failure to implement our strategic plan with success, including our ability to achieve anticipated savings in connection with any potential future acquisitions, could result in increased costs and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nBecause we are highly levered, we expect that we may need to issue additional equity to support our growth; however, we may not be eligible to use a Form S-3, therefore, the process of raising capital to support our growth may be more expensive and time consuming and the terms of any offering transaction may not be as favorable as they would have been if we were eligible to use Form S-3. Moreover, the addition of a substantial number of shares of the our common stock into the market or the registration of any other securities may significantly and negatively affect the prevailing market price for our common stock and would dilute the ownership of our then existing stockholders.\nThe seasonal nature of our business makes management more difficult, severely reduces cash flow and liquidity during parts of the year and could force us to curtail our operations.\nOur business is seasonal. The majority of our marketing and sales activities take place from late fall to early spring. The greatest volume of shipments and sales typically occurs from late spring through the early fall, which coincides with our third and fourth fiscal quarters. This requires us to build-up inventories during our first and second fiscal quarters when our cash flow is weakest. Cash flow is typically strongest in the third and fourth fiscal quarters. Unfavorable economic conditions affecting retailers during the fall and holiday seasons in any year could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the year. We are likely to experience periods of negative cash flow throughout each year, including, a drop-off in business commencing each December, which could force us to curtail operations if adequate liquidity is not available. We cannot assure you that the effects of such seasonality will diminish in the future.\nOur trademark and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected and some of our products are targets of counterfeiting.\nWe believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position. We may, however, experience conflict with various third parties who acquire or claim ownership rights in certain trademarks as we expand our product offerings and expand the number of countries where we sell our products. We cannot ensure that any actions taken to establish and protect these trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of their trademarks and proprietary rights. Also, we cannot assure you that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other proprietary rights of ours or that we will be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nOur products are sometimes the target of counterfeiters. As a result, there are often products that are imitations or \"knock-offs\" of our products that can be found in the marketplace or consumers can find products that are confusingly similar to ours. We intend to continue to vigorously defend our trademarks and products bearing our trademarks, however, we cannot assure you that our efforts will be adequate to prosecute and block all sales of infringing products from the marketplace.\nOur ability to conduct business in international markets may be affected by legal, regulatory, political and economic risks.\nOur ability to capitalize on growth in new and existing international markets is subject to risks associated with international operations. Some of these risks include:\n\u2022 the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations;\n\u2022 unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022 new tariffs or other barriers to some international markets.\nWe are also subject to general political and economic risks associated with conducting international business, including:\n\u2022 political instability;\n\u2022 changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; and\n\u2022 general economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets.\nWe cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes, or other similar restrictions will be imposed by the United States, Mexico, the European Union, Canada, China, Japan, India, South Korea or other countries upon the import or export of our products in the future, or what effect any of these actions would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Changes in regulatory or geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect our business in the future or may require us to modify our current business practices.\nOur common stock price is volatile and may decrease.\nThe market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly and investors in our common stock could lose the value of their investment. In addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent times, which could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or liquidity of, our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nThe trading price and volume of our common stock has historically been subject to fluctuations in response to factors such as the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022 annual and quarterly variations in actual or anticipated operating results;\n\u2022 operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022 changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022 changes in market valuations of other premium denim apparel companies;\n\u2022 announcements of new product lines by us or our competitors, announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or dispositions of assets, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key personnel or members of our board of directors; and\n\u2022 general conditions in the apparel industry.\nIn the 52 week period prior to the filing of this Annual Report, the closing price of our common stock has ranged from $2.85 to $10.95 (after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split). In addition, stock markets generally have experienced price and volume trading volatility in recent years. This volatility has had an effect on the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons unrelated to the\noperating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe Merger and the related Merger Transactions may not achieve its intended results and could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe entered into various agreements in connection with the Merger with the expectation that the Merger and the related Merger Transactions would result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings, operating efficiencies, growth opportunities and the alleviation of certain issues related to our liquidity. Our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger and the related Merger Transactions is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the Robert Graham Business is combined with Hudson Business in an efficient and effective manner. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of revenues we expect to generate and diversion of management's time and energy and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and prospects.\nMoreover, our future financial results will depend in part on our ability to profitably manage our core businesses, including any growth related to the combination of our Hudson Business and Robert Graham Business. Over the past several years, we have engaged in the identification of, and competition for, growth and expansion opportunities. In order to achieve those initiatives, we will need to, among other things, recruit, train, retain and effectively manage employees and expand our operations and financial control systems. If we are unable to manage our businesses effectively and profitably, including, without limitation, in connection with the wind down of certain retail leases as discussed below, our business and financial results could suffer.\nWe may be unable to integrate the Company and RG successfully or realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger and the related Merger Transactions and our future business and financial results may be negatively impacted.\nWe have incurred and continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with the Merger and the related Merger Transactions and the integration of the Company and RG. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated. While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred, there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that the Merger expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of cost savings. These integration expenses likely will result in us taking significant charges against earnings, and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present. There can be no assurance that the elimination of duplicative costs or the realization of any other efficiencies related to the Merger will allow us to offset transaction-related costs in the near term, or at all.\nOur ability to operate profitably depends on our ability to implement our strategic plan with success, including our ability to successfully and efficiently integrate the businesses operations and personnel of the Company and RG. In order to achieve a successful integration, we must, among other things, retain and effectively manage employees. Our success is dependent on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified management, designers, administrative talent and sales associates to support existing operations and future growth. Competition for qualified talent in the apparel and fashion industry is intense, and we compete for these individuals with other companies that in many cases have greater financial and other resources. If we experience a large-scale loss of employees as a result of the Merger, we may be unable to manage our business effectively and profitably, and our business and financial results could suffer. Even if integration is successful, the financial performance of our business may not be as expected and there can be no assurance we will realize the benefits that we\nexpect to achieve. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefit could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect our future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nAs a result of the Merger, we expect our business to expand, and our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements or other benefits currently anticipated from the Merger.\nOwnership of our common stock is concentrated among affiliates of TCP, which substantially reduces the ability of other stockholders to influence management, including through the election of directors, and may result in decisions that do not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders.\nIn connection with the Merger and the Merger Transactions, we effected the Reverse Stock Split and issued or reserved for issuance 15,688,675 shares of our common stock consisting of (1) 8,870,968 shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (2) up to 4,480,287 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, (3) 1,154,194 shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the Rollover Agreement and (4) 1,183,226 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Modified Convertible Notes. Upon the closing of the Merger, affiliates of TCP owned an aggregate of approximately 32.04 percent of our outstanding voting power.\nThe holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, which is an affiliate of TCP, will, for so long as they remain outstanding, have certain rights and privileges, such as the election of up to three (3) directors to our board of directors. Additionally, the holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, on an as converted basis, on all matters presented to the common stockholders for approval. Accordingly, the ability of our other stockholders to influence our management, including through the election of directors, may be reduced. At the same time, affiliates of TCP are in a position to exert significant control over us and have the ability to substantially influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, an increase in the number of shares authorized for issuance under our stock option plans, and to exert significant control over our management and affairs, which may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to other stockholders.\nAdditionally, under the terms of the Modified Convertible Notes that were issued pursuant to the Rollover Agreement, we can choose how we settle the conversion of the Modified Convertible Notes. We are able to settle by issuing shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and common stock, at our election. If we settle through the issuance of common stock, the ownership interest held by our existing stockholders will be reduced.", "PERMNO": 76858, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "CTRCQ"}
