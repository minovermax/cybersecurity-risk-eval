Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of the primary risks associated with the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations, and common stock.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Corporation\nA focus on real estate related loans may increase the risk of substantial credit losses.\nThe Bank offers a variety of loan products, including residential mortgage, consumer, construction and commercial loans. The Bank requires real estate as collateral for many of its loans. At December 31, 2015, approximately 71% of its loans were secured by real estate. Loans secured by real estate and the percent of the loan portfolio are reported in Table 15. These real estate loans are located primarily in the Bank\u2019s market area of south central Pennsylvania. Real estate values tend to follow changes in general economic cycles. If a loan becomes delinquent as the result of an economic downturn and the Bank becomes dependent on the real estate collateral as a source of repayment, it is likely that the value of the real estate collateral has also declined. A decline in real estate values means it is possible that the real estate collateral may be insufficient to cover the outstanding balance of a delinquent or foreclosed loan, resulting in a loss to the Bank. In addition, the real estate collateral is concentrated in a small market area of south central Pennsylvania. Localized events that affect real estate prices and collateral values could have a more negative affect on the Bank as compared to other competitors with a more geographically diverse portfolio. As the Bank grows, it is expected that real estate secured loans will continue to comprise a significant part of its balance sheet. Risk of loan default is unavoidable in the banking industry, and Management tries to limit exposure to this risk by carefully monitoring the amount of loans in specific industries and by exercising prudent lending practices and securing appropriate collateral. However, this risk cannot be eliminated and substantial credit losses could result in reduced earnings or losses.\nThe allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb inherent losses in our loan portfolio.\nThe Bank maintains an allowance for loan losses that Management believes is appropriate to provide for any inherent losses in the loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance is determined through a periodic review and consideration of several factors, including an ongoing review of the quality, size and diversity of our loan portfolio; evaluation of nonperforming loans; historical loan loss experience; and the amount and quality of collateral, including guarantees, securing the loan.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAlthough Management believes the loan loss allowance is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio, such losses cannot be predicted and the allowance may not be adequate. Excessive loan losses could have a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank\u2019s lending limit is smaller than many of our competitors, which affects the size of the loans it can offer customers.\nThe Bank\u2019s lending limit is approximately $17.3 million. Accordingly, the size of the loans that can be offered to customers is less than the size of loans that many of our competitors, with larger lending limits, can offer. This limit affects the Bank\u2019s ability to seek relationships with larger businesses in its market area. Loan amounts in excess of the lending limits can be accommodated through the sale of participations in such loans to other banks. However, there can be no assurance that the Bank will be successful in attracting or maintaining customers seeking larger loans or that it will be able to engage in participation of such loans or on terms favorable to the Bank.\nThere is strong competition in the Bank\u2019s primary market areas.\nThe Bank encounters strong competition from other financial institutions in its primary market area, which consists of Franklin, Cumberland, Fulton and Huntingdon Counties, Pennsylvania. In addition, established financial institutions not already operating in the Bank\u2019s primary market area may open branches there at future dates or can compete in the market via the Internet. In the conduct of certain aspects of banking business, the Bank also competes with savings institutions, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, consumer finance companies, insurance companies and other institutions, some of which are not subject to the same degree of regulation or restrictions as are imposed upon the Bank. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits and can offer services that the Bank does not provide. In addition, many of these competitors have numerous branch offices located throughout their extended market areas that provide them with a competitive advantage. No assurance can be given that such competition will not have an adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates could have an adverse impact upon our results of operations.\nThe Bank\u2019s profitability is in part a function of the spread between interest rates earned on investments, loans and other interest-earning assets and the interest rates paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Recently, interest rate spreads have generally narrowed due to changing market conditions and competitive pricing pressure. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Bank\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence not only the interest received on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but will also affect the Bank\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the value of our investment portfolio. If the rate of interest paid on deposits and other borrowings increases more than the rate of interest earned on loans and other investments, the Bank\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the rates on loans and other investments fall more quickly than those on deposits and other borrowings. While Management takes measures to guard against interest rate risk, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in minimizing the exposure to interest rate risk.\nOur operational or security systems may experience interruption or breach in security, including cyber-attacks.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. These systems include both our internal network and data systems, as well as those of third party vendors. Any failure, interruption or breach in security or these systems, including a cyber-attack, could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information. While we have systems, policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of client business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Common Stock\nThere is a limited trading market for the Corporation\u2019s common stock.\nThere is currently only a limited public market for the Corporation\u2019s common stock. It is quoted on the OTCQX Market Tier of the OTC Markets under the symbol \u201cFRAF\u201d (www.otcmarkets.com/stock/FRAF/quote). Because it is thinly traded, you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock for a price that is equal to the price that you paid for your shares. The Corporation currently has no plans to apply to have its common stock listed for trading on any stock exchange or the NASDAQ market.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Bank's ability to pay dividends to the Corporation is subject to regulatory limitations that may affect the Corporation\u2019s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders.\nAs a holding company, the Corporation is a separate legal entity from the Bank and does not have significant operations of its own. It currently depends upon the Bank's cash and liquidity to pay dividends to its shareholders. The Corporation cannot assure you that in the future the Bank will have the capacity to pay dividends to the Corporation. Various statutes and regulations limit the availability of dividends from the Bank. It is possible; depending upon the Bank's financial condition and other factors, that the Bank\u2019s regulators could assert that payment of dividends by the Bank to the Corporation would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. In the event that the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Corporation, the Corporation may not be able to pay dividends to its shareholders.", "PERMNO": 18652, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FRAF"}
