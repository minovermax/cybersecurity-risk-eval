{"cik": "1141807", "company": "1ST CONSTITUTION BANCORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following are certain factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those referred to or implied in any forward-looking statement. These are in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K and the Company\u2019s other filings with the SEC.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented in response intended to prevent its spread have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, our customers, employees, and third-parties with which we conduct business, which has consequently affected our business, results of operations and financial condition, the ultimate impact of which will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict at this time, but could be significant.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China and its rapid spread has caused global disruption in the financial markets and our primary market is increasingly threatened by the continued spread of this virus. The ultimate impact of COVID-19 is uncertain at this time, but the known effects of, and risks posed by, the pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition are discussed below.\nIn response to public health concerns resulting from the pandemic, governments around the world have implemented a variety of precautionary measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions and bans, instructions to residents to practice social distancing, quarantine advisories, shelter-in-place orders and required closures of non-essential businesses. These government mandates have forced many of our customers and vendors, which are primarily located in northern and central New Jersey, communities along the New Jersey shore and the New York City metropolitan area, to seek government support in order to continue operating, to curtail drastically their service offerings or to cease operations entirely.\nIn addition, these measures have negatively affected, and may further affect, consumer sentiment and discretionary spending patterns, economies and financial markets, and our workforce, operations and customers. Among other measures, we have implemented a work-from-home policy for our employees whose jobs can be performed remotely, provided employees who are not working remotely with appropriate protective equipment and supplies, adjusted branch hours and temporarily closed all of our branch lobbies, except on an appointment only basis. However, in mid-June we re-opened the interior access to all of our branch offices to customers. These changes in our operations in response to COVID-19 have impacted the way that we operate and conduct business, and have resulted in inefficiencies or delays, including additional costs related to business\ncontinuity initiatives, employees working remotely or teleconferencing technologies. The pandemic and widespread responses thereto have also caused significant volatility in financial markets, including the market price of our common stock.\nThe known consequences of and responses to the pandemic, including the public health problems resulting from COVID-19 and precautionary measures instituted by governments and businesses to mitigate its spread, particularly in our primary market areas, have raised the prospect of an extended global recession, which would adversely impact the businesses of our customers, clients, counterparties and service providers, as well as other market participants, and could further disrupt our operations. Other known impacts and anticipated risks of the COVID-19 pandemic include, but are not limited to, the following:\na.We primarily operate in northern and central New Jersey, communities along the New Jersey shore and the New York City metropolitan area, which are among some of the most affected areas in the U.S. and, accordingly, are the most likely geographies to remain subject to governmental restrictions aimed at curtailing household and non-essential business activity to contain COVID-19 for a prolonged period. The longer that our clients, customers, communities and business partners remain subject to such restrictions, the greater the likelihood that economic and demand uncertainty will increase, which could negatively impact, among other things, demand for and profitability of the Bank\u2019s products and services and our liquidity, regulatory capital and growth strategy.\nb.Concern about the spread of COVID-19 and the measures enacted to mitigate its spread have already caused and are likely to continue to cause business shutdowns and interruptions, increased unemployment, labor shortages and commercial property vacancies, and supply chain disruptions, all of which contribute to economic and financial market instability and which, in turn, could impact the ability of our customers to make scheduled loan payments. If the pandemic results in widespread and sustained repayment shortfalls on loans in our portfolio, we could incur significant delinquencies, foreclosures and credit losses, particularly if the available collateral is insufficient to cover our exposure.\nc.Our financial performance, the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans, and the value of the collateral securing such loans is highly dependent upon the business environment in the U.S. generally and in northern and central New Jersey, communities along the New Jersey shore and the New York City metropolitan area in particular. Further economic downturn resulting from the pandemic, particularly in our primary market areas, could negatively impact the collateral values associated with our existing loans, the ability to liquidate the real estate collateral securing our residential and commercial real estate loans, our ability to maintain loan origination volume and to obtain additional financing, and the financial condition and credit risk of our customers, among other credit risks.\nd.Future legislative responses and regulatory policy changes to protect borrowers, such as forbearance, waiver of late payment and other fees, and the suspension of foreclosures, may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. We may need to further increase the allowance for loan losses if borrowers experience financial difficulties beyond forbearance periods, which would adversely affect our net income.\ne.Our ability to meet customer servicing expectations may be limited due to certain operational risks as a result of our reduced hours, branch lobby closures and work-from-home policy, as described above, including reduced productivity in our workforce, less reliable and more limited access to the networks, information systems, applications and other tools available to employees, as well as increased cybersecurity and information security risk.\nf.In addition, our reliance on third-party service providers and vendors exposes us to certain operational risks to the extent that such service providers and vendors continue to have limited capacities for a prolonged period or if additional limitations or potential disruptions in these services materialize. By way of example, our business depends on vendors that supply essential services such as loan servicers, providers of financial information, systems and analytical tools and providers of electronic payment and settlement systems, among others. Without these services, we have experienced and will continue to experience delays in originating and closing loans.\ng.During this challenging economic environment, our communities are increasingly relying on us to access necessary capital and our customers are more dependent on our credit commitments. Increased borrowings under these commitments could adversely impact our liquidity. Moreover, our management has been focused on meeting clients\u2019 needs and mitigating the impact of the pandemic on our business, which has required and will continue to require a substantial investment of time and resources across our enterprise. This has resulted and can be expected to continue to result in a diversion of management attention.\nh.Historically low interest rates caused by uncertainties stemming from COVID-19 could negatively impact our net interest income, lending activities, deposits and profitability.\nThe duration, extent and impact of the pandemic, including resurgences in our primary market areas, sporadic resurgences following a period of containment and restrictions, the severity of newly identified strains of the virus and the timing, availability and efficacy of the various COVID-19 vaccines, continue to be nearly impossible to estimate at this time. However, each of these risks and uncertainties can be expected to persist at least until the pandemic is demonstrably and sustainably\ncontained, authorities cease curbing household and business activity, and consumer and business confidence recover. The COVID-19 pandemic and the volatile economic conditions stemming from it could also precipitate, enhance or contribute to the other risk factors identified in this Form 10-K, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, prospects, and stock price, and may also affect our business in a manner that is not presently known or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our business, financial position, results of operations or prospects.\nAs a participating lender in the SBA\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d), we are exposed to additional litigation risk and credit risks.\nTo support our customers, businesses and communities, we are participating in the PPP established under the CARES Act, notwithstanding that our participation in this federal relief program exposes the Company and the Bank to additional litigation risk. Several national banking associations have already been subject to litigation regarding their respective procedures for processing PPP applications. The Company and the Bank may be exposed to the risk of litigation, from both clients and non-clients that approached the Bank regarding PPP loans, regarding the manner in which we processed PPP applications. Any such litigation regardless of the outcome, may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation.\nOur participation in the PPP and any other relief programs established under the CARES Act further exposes us to certain credit risks. Among other regulatory requirements, PPP loans are subject to forbearance of loan payments for a six-month period to the extent that loans are not eligible for forgiveness. If PPP borrowers fail to qualify for loan forgiveness, we have a greater risk of holding these loans at unfavorable interest rates as compared to the loans to customers that we would have otherwise extended credit. Additionally, there is risk that the SBA could conclude there is a deficiency in the manner in which the Bank originated, funded, or serviced PPP loans, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the CARES Act or the rules and guidance promulgated by the SBA and the U.S. Department of the Treasury thereunder regarding the operation of the PPP.\nRisks Related to Changes in Interest Rates and Market Volatility\nChanges in interest rates and historically low interest rates could adversely affect our net interest income and profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s earnings are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest the Company receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but could also affect (i) the Company\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of the Company\u2019s mortgage-backed securities portfolio. If the spread between the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings and the interest rates received on loans and other investments narrows, the Company\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. This also includes the risk that interest-earning assets may be more responsive to changes in interest rates than interest-bearing liabilities, or vice versa (repricing risk), the risk that the individual interest rates or rate indices underlying various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may not change in the same degree over a given time period (basis risk), and the risk of changing interest rate relationships across the spectrum of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability maturities (yield curve risk).\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board acted to decrease the targeted fed funds interest rates to 0%-0.25% in March 2020, and it is anticipated that interest rates could remain near zero through 2023. This may cause our net interest margin to decline, which may have an adverse effect on our profitability. Although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the Company\u2019s results of operations, any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated widely and may continue to fluctuate as a result of recent market uncertainty and volatility.\nThe price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market constantly changes and recently, given the uncertainty in the financial markets, has fluctuated widely. From the beginning of fiscal year 2019 through the end of fiscal year 2020, our closing stock price fluctuated between a high of $22.46 per share and a low of $9.88 per share. We expect that the market closing price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate. Consequently, the current market price of our common stock may\nnot be indicative of future market prices, and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock regardless of our operating results. Our common stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control and include:\n\u2022quarterly fluctuations in our operating and financial results;\n\u2022operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022events negatively impacting the financial services industry which result in a general decline in the market valuation of our common stock;\n\u2022announcements of material developments affecting our operations or our dividend policy;\n\u2022future sales of our equity securities;\n\u2022new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022interest rate changes or credit loss trends; and\n\u2022general domestic economic and market conditions.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Lending Activities\nA downturn in economic conditions in general, or the economic conditions and/or real estate market in our primary market areas in particular, would adversely affect our loan portfolio, which is secured primarily by real estate in a concentrated geographic area, and our growth potential.\nSubstantially all of the loans the Company originates are secured by properties located in, or are made to businesses that operate in, northern and central New Jersey, communities along the New Jersey shore and the New York City metropolitan area. As a result of this geographic concentration, a significant broad-based deterioration in economic conditions in our primary market areas could have a material adverse impact on the quality of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio, results of operations and future growth potential. A prolonged decline in economic conditions in our primary market areas could result in increased unemployment, downward pressure on the value of residential or commercial real estate, or other conditions that limit or restrict borrowers\u2019 ability to pay outstanding principal and interest on loans when due, and consequently, adversely affect the cash flows and results of operations of the Company\u2019s business and our earnings.\nIn addition, conditions in the real estate markets in which the collateral for the Company\u2019s loans are located strongly influence the level of the Company\u2019s non-performing loans and results of operations. A downturn in the real estate markets in the Company\u2019s primary market areas could result in an increase in the number of borrowers who default on loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing loans, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability and asset quality. Further, if the Company is required to liquidate collateral securing a loan to satisfy the related debt during a period of reduced real estate values, the Company may experience higher loan losses than expected and its earnings and shareholders\u2019 equity could be adversely affected. Any declines in real estate prices in the Company\u2019s primary markets may also result in increases in delinquencies and losses in its loan portfolios. Unanticipated decreases in real estate prices coupled with a prolonged economic downturn and elevated levels of unemployment could drive loan losses beyond the level provided for in the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses. If this occurs, the Company\u2019s earnings could be adversely affected.\nFor a discussion of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our loan portfolio and lending activities, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-COVID-19 Impact and Response.\u201d\nOur construction loan, commercial business and commercial real estate loan portfolio exposes us to increased lending risks.\nAt December 31, 2020, $129.2 million, or 9.0%, of our loan portfolio consisted of construction loans, and $807.7 million, or 56.3%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial business and commercial real estate loans. Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied residential real estate. These risks include the borrower\u2019s inability to complete the construction process on time and within budget, the sale of the project within projected absorption periods, the economic risks associated with real estate collateral, and the potential of a rising interest rate environment. Because the sale and leasing of developed properties is integral to the success of developer\u2019s business, loan repayments may be especially subject to changes in economic conditions, the volatility of real estate market values and the marketability of a construction project. Management has established underwriting and monitoring criteria to minimize the inherent risks of speculative commercial real estate construction lending and concentrates lending efforts with developers demonstrating successful performance on marketable projects within the Bank\u2019s lending areas. However, this concentration of constructions loans exposes us to additional risk in the event of an adverse development with respect to one\ncredit relationship. Further, there can be no assurance that any actions taken or policies implemented by management with respect to construction loans will successfully mitigate these risks.\nAs with our construction loans, the inherent primary risks of our commercial business and commercial real estate loans are deteriorating credit quality, a decline in the economy, and a decline in real estate market values in our primary market areas. Any one, or a combination, of these events may adversely affect the loan portfolio and may result in increased delinquencies, loan losses and increased future provision levels.\nAt December 31, 2020, one construction loan totaling $7.5 million and eleven commercial business and commercial real estate loans totaling $7.8 million were considered non-performing and on nonaccrual status. For more information about the quality of our construction loan and commercial business and real estate loan portfolio, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Financial Condition-Non-Performing Assets.\u201d\nOur emphasis on mortgage warehouse lines of credit is generally subject to unique risks than other lending activities.\nAt December 31, 2020, $388.4 million, or 27.1%, of our loan portfolio consisted of mortgage warehouse lines of credit. Our emphasis on mortgage warehouse lines of credit exposes us to additional risks that include, without limitation, (i) credit risks relating to the mortgage bankers that borrow from us, (ii) the risk of intentional misrepresentation or fraud by any of such mortgage bankers, (iii) changes in the market value of mortgage loans originated by the mortgage banker, the sale of which is the expected source of repayment of the borrowings under a warehouse line of credit, due to changes in interest rates during the time in warehouse, and (iv) unsalable or impaired mortgage loans so originated, which could lead to decreased collateral value and the failure of a purchaser of the mortgage loan to purchase the loan from the mortgage banker.\nThe impact of interest rates on our mortgage warehouse business can be significant. Changes in interest rates can impact the number of residential mortgages originated and initially funded under mortgage warehouse lines of credit and thus our mortgage warehouse related revenues. A decline in mortgage rates generally increases the demand for mortgage loans. Conversely, in a constant or increasing rate environment, we would expect fewer loans may be originated. Although we use models to assess the impact of interest rates on mortgage related revenues, the estimates of net income produced by these models are dependent on estimates and assumptions of future loan demand, prepayment speeds and other factors which may overstate or understate actual subsequent experience. Further, the concentration of our loan portfolio on loans originated through our mortgage warehouse business increases the risk associated with our loan portfolio generally because of the concentration of loans in a single line of business, namely one-to-four family residential mortgage lending, and in a particular segment of that business, namely mortgage warehouse lending.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could materially decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loan and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our loan portfolio and our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs or reclassify loans. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs or loan reclassifications could materially decrease our net income and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic and social disruption, we significantly increased our allowance for loan losses, which has resulted in a $6.4 million increase in the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. For more information about our allowance for loan losses, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations-Provision for Loan Losses.\u201d\nRisks Related to Strategic Activities and the Company\u2019s Operations\nThe expected benefits from acquiring another entity may not be realized if we do not successfully integrate acquired banks and the combined bank does not achieve certain cost savings and other benefits.\nWhile focusing on organic growth, our strategy also includes, in part, growth through acquisitions. The Company may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, or complete acquisitions. Further, the success of any acquisition depends on the ability to effectively integrate the acquired business, including integrating operations and achieving synergies and cost efficiencies. We may experience difficulties in accomplishing this integration or in effectively managing the combined bank\nafter any future acquisition. The integration of any acquired entity will also divert the attention of our management. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in integrating any future acquisitions into our own business.\nOur belief that cost savings and revenue enhancements are achievable in any future acquisition is a forward-looking statement that is inherently uncertain. The combined bank\u2019s actual cost savings and revenue enhancements, if any, for any future acquisition cannot be quantified at the time of acquisition. Any actual cost savings or revenue enhancements will depend on future expense levels and operating results, the timing of certain events and general industry, regulatory and business conditions. Many of these events will be beyond the control of the combined bank.\nAs a community bank, we face significant competition from both other banks and non-bank financial institutions for customers and the Bank's products and services, which compete against the rapidly changing technologies offered in the financial services industry.\nThe Company faces significant competition from many other banks, savings institutions and other financial institutions that have branch offices or otherwise operate in the Company\u2019s market area. Non-bank financial institutions, such as securities brokerage firms, insurance companies and money market funds, engage in activities which compete directly with traditional bank business, which has also led to greater competition. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources than the Company, including larger capital bases that allow them to attract customers seeking larger loans than the Company is able to accommodate, to aggressively advertise their products and to allocate considerable resources to locations and products perceived as profitable.\nThese competitors also have more resources and to invest in technological improvements. The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and may reduce costs. The Company\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Company\u2019s operations. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or to successfully market these products and services to its customers. Failure to keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry, or otherwise successfully compete with these entities in the future, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and, in turn, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, due to loss of market share and income generated from loans, deposits and other financial products.\nThe Company is subject to operational risk due to our reliance on third party vendors and service providers.\nWe rely on certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. These third parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections and network access. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any complications caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication or electrical services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor\u2019s ability to provide services. Furthermore, our vendors could also be sources of operational and information security risk, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Problems caused by external vendors could be disruptive to our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProtecting against evolving cybersecurity and electronic fraud risks demands significant resources, and the loss of, or failure to adequately safeguard, confidential or proprietary information may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial operations or reputation.\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks. Although cybersecurity incidents in the financial services industry are on the rise, we have not experienced any losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches. However, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. A failure in or breach of the Company\u2019s operational or information security systems, or those of the Company\u2019s third-party service providers, as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches or due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions could adversely affect its business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage its reputation, increase its\ncosts and/or cause losses. Mishandling, misuse or loss of confidential or proprietary information could also result in significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, civil litigation and financial loss. In addition, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications or disclosure.\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of the Company\u2019s employees have been working remotely, which arrangements contribute to heightened cybersecurity, information security and operational risks. The Company has not experienced any material impact to the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting due to the fact that most of the Company\u2019s employees responsible for financial reporting are working mostly in the office during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the Company is continually monitoring and assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting to minimize any impact on the design and operating effectiveness.\nAs a result of such risks, the Company has significantly increased the resources dedicated to this effort and believes that further increases may be required in the future, in anticipation of increases in the sophistication and persistency of such attacks. The Company has and is likely to continue to incur additional costs in preparing its infrastructure and maintaining it to resist any such attacks. For example, the Company has introduced and continues to introduce systems and software to prevent cyber incidents and continues to review and strengthen its defenses to cybersecurity threats through the use of various services, programs and outside vendors. In addition to personnel dedicated to overseeing the infrastructure and systems to defend against cybersecurity incidents, senior management is regularly briefed on issues, preparedness and any incidents requiring response. At its regularly scheduled meetings, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors are periodically briefed and brought up to date on cybersecurity matters. The Company also continually reviews its internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, corporate governance policies and procedures and cyber security policy to ensure that its systems and procedures remain up to date. However, any system of controls, regardless of how well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the Company's controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNotwithstanding the precautions we take to safeguard confidential and proprietary information, these measures do not provide absolute assurance that mishandling, misuse, loss and theft of the information will not occur, or that if mishandling, misuse loss of theft of the information did occur, those events would be promptly detected and addressed. Nor is there any guarantee that the Company's cybersecurity efforts will be successful in discovering or preventing a security breach, and any failure or failures to safeguard against such security breaches may have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial results, or reputation. In the event that the Company experiences a material cybersecurity incident or identifies a material cybersecurity threat, the Company will make all reasonable efforts to properly disclose it in a timely fashion. However, it is impossible for the Company to know when or if such incidents may arise or the business impact of any such incident.\nRisks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Policy Matters\nThe Company and the Bank operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely impacted by changes in law, regulations, and accounting policies.\nThe operations of the Company and the Bank are subject to examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation and will be affected by present and future legislation and by the policies established from time to time by various federal and state regulatory authorities. Any change in the laws or regulations, failure by the Company to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or a change in regulators\u2019 supervisory policies or examination procedures, whether by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board, other state or federal regulators, the U.S. Congress, or the New Jersey State Legislature could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Changes in accounting policies, practices and standards, as may be adopted by the regulatory agencies, as well as the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and other accounting standard setters, could also impact the Company\u2019s financial results. It is not possible to predict what changes, if any, will be made to the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board or to existing federal and state legislation or the effect that such changes may have on the future business and earnings prospects of the Company. Compliance with the rules and regulations of these agencies may be costly and may limit growth and restrict certain activities, including payment of dividends, investments, loans and interest rate charges, interest rates paid on deposits, and locations of offices.\nThe capital requirements applicable to the Bank, and changes thereto, may inhibit our future growth and operating results.\nFor the Bank to be considered well-capitalized for prompt corrective action purposes under federal regulatory requirements regarding the capital framework for U.S. banking organizations, the Bank is required to maintain the following ratios: (1) a\nCommon Equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) capital ratio of at least 6.5% of risk-weighted assets; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8.0% of risk-weighted assets; (3) a total capital ratio of a least 10.0% of risk-weighted assets; and (4) a leverage ratio of at least 5.0%. The Bank\u2019s CET1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and leverage capital ratios were 11.11%, 11.11%, 12.15%, and 9.40%, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. In addition, there is a requirement to maintain a capital conservation buffer, comprised of CET1capital, in an amount greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets over the minimum capital required by each of the minimum risk-based capital ratios in order to avoid limitations on the organization\u2019s ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses. The capital conservation buffer requirement has been fully implemented and the Company's capital conservation buffer was at a level above 2.5% at December 31, 2020.\nOn September 17, 2019, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule, effective January 1, 2020, creating a CBLR framework for institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion and that meet other qualifying criteria. The CBLR framework provides for a simpler measure of capital adequacy for qualifying institutions. Qualifying institutions that elect to use the CBLR framework and that maintain a leverage ratio of greater than 9% will be considered to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the federal banking agencies\u2019 capital rules and to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements. The Company and the Bank did not elect to use the framework.\nChanges to these capital requirements could increase the Company\u2019s required capital levels and the cost of capital, among other things. Any permanent significant increase in the Company\u2019s cost of capital could have significant adverse impacts on the profitability of many of our products, the types of products we could offer profitably, our overall profitability, and our overall growth opportunities, among other things. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk-based capital calculations or items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could also result in management modifying the Company\u2019s business strategy and limiting the Company\u2019s ability to repurchase our common stock.\nIn addition, to the extent our future operating results erode capital or we elect to expand through loan growth or acquisition, we may be required to raise additional capital. Our ability to raise capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets, which are outside of our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be assured of our ability to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, we will be subject to increased regulatory supervision and the imposition of restrictions on our growth and business. These actions could negatively impact our ability to operate or further expand our operations and may result in increases in operating expenses and reductions in revenues that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, if we are able to raise capital through the capital markets, our common shareholders would be diluted from any stock issuances.\nHigher FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions, including the Bank. The FDIC charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund at a specific level. The Bank's FDIC insurance premiums are based on the risk category assigned to the Bank. If the risk category of the Bank or the FDIC\u2019s assessment rates change adversely, our FDIC insurance premiums could increase, which could have an adverse effect on the Bank's earnings. The FDIC may further increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule in order to manage the Deposit Insurance Fund to prescribed statutory target levels. The FDIC may terminate deposit insurance for an institution if it determines that such institution has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition, or has violated applicable laws, regulations or orders. In addition, insured depository institution failures, as well as deterioration in banking and economic conditions, could significantly increase the loss provisions of the FDIC, resulting in a decline in the designated reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund, currently at 2.00%, to historical lows.\nChanges to and replacement of the LIBOR Benchmark Interest Rate may have an impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), a regulator of financial services firms in the United Kingdom, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. The FCA and submitting LIBOR banks have indicated they will support the LIBOR indices through 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate. Subsequently, on November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (commonly referred to as \u201cICE\u201d) announced its plan to extend the date that most U.S. dollar LIBOR values would cease being computed and announced a change from December 31, 2021 to June 30, 2023. On the same date, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC issued a Joint Statement on LIBOR transition, which instructs banks to cease entering into new contracts that use U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate by no later than December 31, 2021, and if practicable, as far in advance of that deadline as possible, notwithstanding its publication until June 30, 2023. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board. Other financial services regulators and industry groups are evaluating the phase-out of LIBOR and the development of alternate\nreference rate indices or reference rates. Some of our assets and liabilities are indexed to LIBOR. We are evaluating the potential impact of the possible replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, but are not able to predict whether the alternative rates the Federal Reserve Board proposes to publish will become market benchmarks in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of such a transition will have on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Reform of, or the replacement or phasing out of LIBOR and proposed regulation of LIBOR and other \u201cbenchmarks\u201d may materially adversely affect the amount of interest paid on any LIBOR-based loans, investment securities and borrowings of the Company and the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that overnight 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month LIBOR settings will end on June 30, 2023. Reform of, or the replacement or phasing out of, LIBOR and proposed regulation of LIBOR and other \u201cbenchmarks\u201d may materially adversely affect the amount of interest paid on any LIBOR-based loans, investment securities and borrowings of the Company and the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to detect money laundering and other illegal or improper activities fully or on a timely basis, which could expose us to additional liability and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are required to comply with anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism and other laws and regulations in the United States. These laws and regulations require us, among other things, to adopt and enforce \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d policies and procedures and to report suspicious and large transactions to applicable regulatory authorities. These laws and regulations have become increasingly complex and detailed, require improved systems, sophisticated monitoring and compliance personnel and have become the subject of enhanced government supervision.\nWhile we have adopted policies and procedures aimed at detecting and preventing the use of our banking network for money laundering and related activities, those policies and procedures may not completely eliminate instances in which we may be used by customers to engage in money laundering and other illegal or improper activities. To the extent we fail to fully comply with applicable laws and regulations, the FDIC and/or with other banking agencies have the authority to impose fines and other penalties on us. In addition, our business and reputation could suffer if customers use our banking network for money laundering or illegal or improper purposes. At its regularly scheduled meetings, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors are periodically briefed and brought up to date on money laundering and related matters.\nClaims and litigation could result in losses and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation and other financial liability.\nFrom time to time as part of the Company\u2019s normal course of business, current and former customers, bankruptcy trustees, contractual counterparties, third parties and current and former employees make claims and take legal actions against the Company based on actions or inactions of the Company. If such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, they may result in financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of the Company and its products and services. This may also impact customer demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Liquidity\nThe Bank is subject to liquidity risk.\nLiquidity risk is the potential that the Bank will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due, capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise, or pay regular dividends because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding in a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit commitments to borrowers, mortgage and other loan originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of borrowings, dividends to shareholders, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and retention; principal and interest payments on loans; principal and interest payments on investment securities; sale, maturity and prepayment of investment securities; net cash provided from operations and access to other funding sources.\nOur access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. If we become unable to obtain funds when needed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and in turn, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to liquidity risk.\nOur recurring cash requirements, at the holding company level, primarily consist of interest expense on junior subordinated debentures issued to a capital trust. Holding company cash needs are routinely satisfied by dividends collected from the Bank. While we expect that the holding company will continue to receive dividends from the Bank sufficient to satisfy holding company cash needs, in the event that the Bank has insufficient resources or is subject to legal or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends, the Bank may be unable to provide dividends or a sufficient level of dividends to the holding company; in that event, the holding company may have insufficient funds to satisfy its obligations as they become due.\nRisks Related to Financial and Accounting Matters\nThe Company's accounting policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the value of the Company's assets and liabilities and results of operations, and if actual events differ from the Company's estimates and assumptions, or if new accounting standards are adopted, the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding its financial results and condition. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of the Company\u2019s assets or liabilities and financial results. The Company identified its accounting policies regarding the allowance for loan losses, security impairment, goodwill and other intangible assets, and income taxes to be critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Under each of these policies, it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions, using different assumptions, or as new information becomes available.\nFrom time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the form and content of the Company\u2019s external financial statements. FASB recently adopted new accounting standards related to fair value accounting, measurement of credit losses on financial instruments and accounting for leases that could materially change the Company\u2019s financial statements in the future. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, banking regulators and the Company\u2019s independent auditors) may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond the Company\u2019s control, can be hard to predict and could materially impact how the Company reports its financial results and condition. In certain cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively or apply an existing standard differently (also retroactively), which may result in the Company restating prior period financial statements in material amounts.\nFor example, in 2016, the FASB released a new standard for determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses. The new standard will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2023. The new credit loss model will be a significant change from the standard in place today, as it requires the allowance for credit losses to be calculated based on current expected credit losses (commonly referred to as the \u201cCECL model\u201d) rather than losses inherent in the portfolio as of a point in time. Because the new CECL model focuses on the life of the loan concept, more data will be required to support allowance estimates, including that loan portfolios will need to be broken down by origination year. As a result, audit and disclosure requirements will increase. The extent of the increase is under evaluation, but will depend upon the nature and characteristics of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio at the adoption date, and the macroeconomic conditions and forecasts at that date. As a result, the potential financial impact is currently unknown.\nFailure to maintain effective systems of internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition disclosures.\nWe must have effective internal controls over financial reporting in order to provide reliable financial reports, to effectively prevent fraud, and to operate successfully as a public company. If we were unable to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. As part of our ongoing monitoring of our internal controls over financial reporting, we may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies requiring remediation. A \"material weakness\" is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe continually work to improve our internal controls; however, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure appropriate and adequate controls over our future financial processes and reporting. Any failure to maintain effective controls\nor to timely implement any necessary improvement of our internal controls could, among other things, result in losses from fraud or error, harm our reputation, or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and the market value of our common stock.\nThe fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to market conditions out of our control.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 79% of our investment securities portfolio was comprised of U.S. government agency and sponsored enterprises obligations, U.S. government agency and sponsored enterprises' mortgage backed securities and municipal securities. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of our investment portfolio was approximately $220.8 million. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, ratings agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, changes in market interest rates and instability in the credit markets. Any of these mentioned factors, among others, could cause other-than-temporary impairments in future periods and result in a realized loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires complex, subjective judgements about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security.\nBecause of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers and the performance of underlying collateral, we may recognize realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank\u2019s fee-based services may lose appeal with customers during an economic downturn, resulting in increased funding costs and a reduction of the Company\u2019s net interest income and net income.\nEconomic downturns could affect the volume of income earned from and demand for the Bank\u2019s fee-based services. Checking, savings, and money market deposit account balances and other forms of customer deposits can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, the Company could lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing its funding costs and reducing the Company\u2019s net interest income and net income.\nRisks Related to Environmental and Social Matters and Human Capital Management\nOur financial and operating performance could be adversely impacted by disruptions to business conducted, or declines in property values, in northern, central and coastal New Jersey and the New York City metropolitan area, caused by severe weather, changes in climate and other natural disasters, acts of terrorism, public health crises and other external events.\nA significant portion of our primary market includes counties in New Jersey with extensive coastal regions. These areas may be vulnerable to flooding, wind or other damage resulting from severe weather, such as hurricanes and other natural disasters, or changes in climate. As a result of a major natural disaster or changes in climate, our borrowers may suffer uninsured property damage, experience interruption of their businesses or lose their jobs, which may negatively impact the ability of these borrowers to make deposits with us or repay their loans or impair the values of collateral securing our loans, any of which could result in losses and increased provisions for credit losses. Our operations may also be disrupted by the occurrence of natural disasters through interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of our computer systems, which could interfere with our ability to gather deposits and originate loans, as well as through the destruction of facilities and our operational, financial and management information systems.\nIn addition, our primary market includes areas that are central targets of potential acts of terrorism and the concentration of our retail and commercial banking activities makes our business susceptible to disruptions resulting from public health crises and other external events, including trade disruptions caused by increased tariffs. These and other catastrophic events could affect the stability of our deposit base and impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans as a result of quarantines, business closures, shortages in labor or raw materials and overall economic instability, which could result in the loss of revenue. Although the Company has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our executive officers and key personnel to implement our strategy and to maintain the trust and confidence of customers and other market participants and our reputation, which could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nOur success depends in large part on the skills and performance of our executive management team and our ability to motivate and retain these and other key personnel. Accordingly, the loss of service of one or more of our executive officers or key personnel could reduce our ability to successfully implement our business strategy and materially and adversely affect us. Leadership changes will occur from time to time, and if significant resignations occur, we may not be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. We believe our executive management team possesses valuable knowledge about the banking industry and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replicate. Although each of our Chief Executive Officer and President, our Executive Vice President, Chief Lending Officer and Chief Credit Officer and our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer has entered into an employment agreement with us, it is possible that they may not complete the terms of their respective employment agreements or may choose not to exercise options to renew such terms.\nAs a community bank, our customers also rely on us to deliver personalized financial services. Our success depends on the experience of our branch managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve. The loss of the service of these individuals could undermine the confidence of our customers in our ability to provide such personalized services. We need to continue to attract and retain these individuals and to recruit other qualified individuals to ensure continued growth. In addition, competitors may recruit these individuals in light of the value of the individuals\u2019 relationships with their customers and communities and we may not be able to retain such relationships absent the individuals. If we are unable to attract and retain our branch managers and lending officers, and recruit individuals with appropriate skills and knowledge to support our business, our business strategy, business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Investment in Our Securities\nOur directors and executive officers own a meaningful percentage of our stock, which may enable them to influence matters subject to shareholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our directors and executive officers, together with their affiliates and related persons, beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 12.9% of our outstanding shares of common stock. These shareholders, if acting together, may have the ability to determine the outcome of matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these persons, acting together, may have the ability to control the management and affairs of our Company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may harm the market price of our common stock by:\n\u2022delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control;\n\u2022entrenching our management and/or the board of directors;\n\u2022impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving us; or\n\u2022discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nFuture offerings of debt or other securities may adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nIn the future, the Company may attempt to increase its capital resources or, if the Company\u2019s or the Bank\u2019s capital ratios fall below the required minimums, the Company or the Bank could be forced to raise additional capital by making additional offerings of debt or preferred equity securities, including medium-term notes, trust preferred securities, senior or subordinated notes and preferred stock. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock.\nThe Company may issue additional shares of common stock which may dilute the ownership and voting power of our shareholders and the book value of our common stock.\nThe Company is currently authorized to issue up to 30,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 10,241,100 shares were outstanding on February 26, 2021. We may decide to issue additional shares of common stock for any corporate purposes. Our Board of Directors has the authority, without action or vote of our shareholders, to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock in public offerings or up to 20% of our outstanding common stock in non-public offerings. Any issuance of shares of our common stock will dilute the percentage ownership interest of our common shareholders and may reduce the market price of our common stock or dilute the book value of our common stock, or both. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution.", "PERMNO": 89270, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FCCY"}
