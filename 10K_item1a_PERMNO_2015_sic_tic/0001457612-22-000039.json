{"cik": "1457612", "company": "GENOCEA BIOSCIENCES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our business and results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial could also affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe require additional financing to execute our operating plan and continue to operate as a going concern.\nWe had available cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021 of $37.1 million. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $407.9 million and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop our product candidates. In addition, we had a loss from operations of $52.1 million and cash used in operating activities of $45.4 million during 2021. These factors, combined with our forecast of cash required to fund operations for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our future viability beyond one year from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital to finance our operations. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to implement cost reduction strategies, including ceasing development of GEN-011 or our Inhibigens program. We expect to finance our cash needs through the execution of our operating plan which includes a combination of equity offerings, strategic transactions, or other sources of funding, including utilization of the at-the-market equity offering program with Cowen and Company, LLC. Although management plans to pursue additional funding, there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to us to fund continuing operations, or at all. Our existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to support our current operations into Q3 2022.\nWe believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future developing our product candidates, particularly GEN-011. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, potentially acquiring new technologies, and potentially obtaining regulatory approvals. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. Because the outcome of our planned and anticipated clinical trials is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development of our product candidates. Furthermore, because of the significant expense associated with conducting clinical trials, we cannot be certain we will have sufficient capital to complete such trials for a given product candidate.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022the timing and costs of our ongoing and planned clinical trials for GEN-011;\n\u2022the progress, timing, and costs of manufacturing GEN-011;\n\u2022the timing of GEN-011 patient enrollment and dosing;\n\u2022the availability of GEN-011 third-party manufacturing capacity;\n\u2022the initiation, progress, timing, costs, and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our potential product candidates;\n\u2022the terms and timing of any future collaborations, grants, licensing, consulting, or other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u2022the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with the licensing, filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights, including milestone payments, royalty payments and patent prosecution fees that we are obligated to pay pursuant to our license agreements;\n\u2022the costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights, and defending against intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022the extent to which we in-license or acquire other products and technologies;\n\u2022the costs to manufacture material for clinical trials;\n\u2022the costs to seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u2022the costs to attract and retain skilled personnel; and\n\u2022the costs to create additional infrastructure to support our operations as a public company and our product development and planned future commercialization efforts.\nOur operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need additional funds sooner than planned. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us when needed, we would be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate nonclinical studies, clinical trials or other development activities for one or more of our product candidates or delay, limit, reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our founding in 2006 and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, and we have not yet generated significant revenues. We have incurred net losses each year since our inception, including net losses of $33.2 million and $43.7 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $407.9 million. To date, we have not commercialized any products or generated any revenues from the sale of products and do not know whether or when we will generate product revenues or become profitable. Our only source of revenue for 2021 was from the material transfer agreement with Shionogi & Co. Ltd. See Note 3. Revenue within the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through multiple public equity offerings, private placements of our common and preferred stock and debt arrangements.\nWe have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development, including our clinical and nonclinical technology development and development activities. The amount of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of our future expenditures and our ability to obtain funding through equity offerings or strategic transactions. We have not completed pivotal clinical studies for any product candidate, and it will be several years, if ever, before we have a product candidate ready for commercialization. Even if we obtain regulatory approval to market a product candidate, our future revenues will depend upon the size of any markets in which our product candidates have received approval, our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, reimbursement from third-party payors and other factors.\nThe net losses that we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance. In any particular quarter or quarters, our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and eventually commercializing products that generate significant revenue. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing nonclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates, discovering additional product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. We are only in the preliminary stages of most of these activities. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenues that are significant enough to achieve profitability.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. If we are required by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities to perform studies in addition to those currently expected, or if there are any delays in completing our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates, our expenses could increase.\nEven if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or even continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause investors to lose all or part of their investment.\nSEC regulations limit the amount of funds we may raise during any 12-month period pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3.\nOur public float was less than $75 million within 60 days of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result, under General Instruction I.B.6 to Form S-3, the amount of funds we can raise through primary public offerings of securities, including through our ATM, in any 12-month period using our registration statement on Form S-3 is limited to one-third of the aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting common equity held by our non-affiliates. We are subject to this limitation until such time as our public float exceeds $75 million. If we are required to file a new registration statement on another form, we may incur additional costs and be subject to delays due to review by the SEC.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates on unfavorable terms to us.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, existing ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take certain actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we would be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts for GEN-011, GEN-009, or our other product candidates.\nOur stockholders will experience substantial additional dilution if outstanding warrants or stock options are exercised for common stock.\nAs of March 15, 2022, the number of shares of our common stock outstanding excludes approximately 51.0 million shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants, having a weighted-average exercise price of $2.26 per share, and approximately 5.3 million shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options, having a weighted-average exercise price of $3.94 per share. The exercise of outstanding warrants or stock options for common stock would be substantially dilutive to existing stockholders. As of March 15, 2022, the number of shares of our common stock outstanding also excludes approximately 2.8 million shares of common stock issuable upon vesting of restricted stock units (assuming the Company achieves its corporate stock price metrics at the target achievement level), approximately 0.9 million shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our Amended and Restated 2014 Equity Incentive Plan and less than 0.1 million shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended. Any dilution or potential dilution may cause our stockholders to sell their shares, which may contribute to a downward movement in the stock price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Clinical Development, Regulatory Review and Approval of Our Product Candidates\nWe are substantially dependent on the success of the clinical development of GEN-011. Any failure to successfully develop or commercialize the GEN-011 T cell therapy, or any significant delays in doing so, will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are now currently investing a majority of our efforts and financial resources in the development of GEN-011, an adoptive T cell therapy which is currently in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial. Our ability to generate product revenue depends heavily on the success of clinical trials for GEN-011 and the successful development and commercialization of GEN-011. The successful development and commercialization of GEN-011 will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u2022successful completion of all required clinical trials of GEN-011;\n\u2022obtaining marketing approvals from regulatory authorities for GEN-011;\n\u2022establishing manufacturing and commercialization arrangements between ourselves and third parties;\n\u2022establishing an acceptable safety and efficacy profile of GEN-011; and\n\u2022the availability of reimbursement to patients from healthcare payors for GEN-011.\nAny failure to successfully develop or commercialize GEN-011 or any significant delays in doing so will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreasing costs of vendors and suppliers upon which we rely for our clinical development programs could adversely affect our business.\nThe costs of materials from our vendors and suppliers, particularly for our GEN-011 clinical trial, are increasing and may continue to increase in the foreseeable future. Such increasing costs and the extent to which costs may increase could result in our inability to procure materials necessary for our GEN-011 clinical trial or other preclinical and clinical trials on time or at all. If we are unable to receive on a timely basis or at reasonable costs the materials necessary for the development of GEN-011 or any other product candidates, our ability to successfully develop GEN-011 or any other product candidates may be impeded and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause our active product candidates are in an early stage of clinical development, there is a high risk of failure, and we may never succeed in developing marketable products or generating product revenue.\nWe are currently conducting a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of GEN-011, and we are collecting long-term data from the GEN-009 program. A decision to stop either or both of these trials would result in a delay in the clinical progress, approval and commercialization of the affected programs. Even if the results are successful, such results may not be replicated in later and larger clinical trials. Among other reasons for the potential failure of earlier, smaller clinical trials to be replicated in later, larger clinical trials is the fact that manufacturing scale up is necessary to prepare for Phase 3 development and commercialization. Our product candidates may require complex manufacturing processes and scaling up these processes can cause changes in the product that may not be apparent until the product is further tested during Phase 3 trials.\nIf the results of our future clinical trials are inconclusive with respect to the efficacy of our product candidates or if we do not meet our clinical endpoints with statistical significance or if there are safety concerns or adverse events (\"AEs\") associated with our product candidates, we may be prevented or delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates. Alternatively, even if we obtain regulatory approval, that approval may be for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired or may require labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings. We may also be required to perform additional or unanticipated clinical trials to obtain approval or be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements to maintain regulatory approval. In addition, regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution in the form of a REMS.\nIf we do not obtain regulatory approval for our current and future product candidates, our business will be adversely affected.\nOur product candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to, among other things, research, clinical trials, manufacturing, import, export and commercialization. In order to obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any product candidate, we must demonstrate through extensive nonclinical studies and clinical trials that the product candidate is safe and effective for use in each target indication. Clinical trials are expensive, time consuming and uncertain as to outcome. We may gain regulatory approval for GEN-011, GEN-009 or our other current or potential future clinical and nonclinical product candidates in some but not all of the territories available or some but not all of the target indications, resulting in limited commercial opportunity for our product candidates, or we may never obtain regulatory approval for these product candidates for any indication in any jurisdiction.\nInterim, \u201ctopline,\u201d and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to confirmation, audit, and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose preliminary or topline data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations, and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the topline results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Topline data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, topline data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. From time to time, we may also disclose interim data from our clinical trials. Interim or preliminary data from clinical trials are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment and treatment continues and more patient data become available or as patients from our clinical trials continue other treatments for their disease. Adverse differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects. Further, disclosure of interim data by us or by our competitors could result in volatility in the price of our common stock.\nFurther, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the potential of the particular program, the likelihood of marketing approval or commercialization of the particular product candidate, any approved product, and our company in general. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is derived from information that is typically extensive, and investors or others may not agree with what we determine is material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure.\nIf the interim, topline, or preliminary data that we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and commercialize, our product candidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.\nResults from previous or ongoing studies are not necessarily predictive of our future clinical study results, and initial or interim results may not continue or be confirmed upon completion of the study. There is limited data concerning long-term safety and efficacy following treatment with our product candidates. These data, or other positive data, may not continue or occur for these patients or for any future patients in our ongoing or future clinical trials, and may not be repeated or observed in ongoing or future studies involving our product candidates. Furthermore, our product candidates may also fail to show the desired safety and efficacy in later stages of clinical development despite having successfully advanced through initial clinical trials. There can be no assurance that any of these studies will ultimately be successful or support further clinical advancement or marketing approval of our product candidates.\nWe may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials, which could delay or prevent clinical trials of our product candidates.\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical trials depends on the speed at which we can recruit patients to participate in testing our product candidates. If patients are unwilling to participate in our studies because of negative publicity from AEs in the biotechnology industries or for other reasons, including competitive clinical trials for similar patient populations, the timeline for recruiting patients, conducting studies and obtaining regulatory approval of potential products may be delayed or prevented. These delays could result in increased costs, delays in advancing our product development, delays in testing the effectiveness of our technology or termination of the clinical trials altogether.\nWe may not be able to identify, recruit and enroll a sufficient number of patients, or those with required or desired characteristics to achieve diversity in a study, to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner. Patient enrollment is affected by factors including:\n\u2022severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022design of the study protocol;\n\u2022size of the patient population;\n\u2022eligibility criteria for the trial in question;\n\u2022perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u2022proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients;\n\u2022ability to recruit investigators and maintain IRB approvals;\n\u2022availability of competing therapies and clinical trials;\n\u2022efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022delays as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical trial recruitment;\n\u2022patient referral practices of physicians; and\n\u2022ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials if we cannot enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in the clinical trials required by regulatory agencies. If we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical trials as planned, we may need to delay, limit or terminate ongoing or planned clinical trials, any of which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to comply with requirements of foreign jurisdictions in conducting trials outside of the U.S.\nTo date, we have not conducted any clinical trials outside of the U.S. Our ability to successfully initiate, enroll and complete a clinical trial in any foreign country, should we attempt to do so, is subject to numerous risks unique to conducting business in foreign countries, including:\n\u2022difficulty in establishing or managing relationships with contract research organizations (\"CROs\") and physicians;\n\u2022different standards for the conduct of clinical trials;\n\u2022our inability to locate qualified local consultants, physicians and partners;\n\u2022the potential burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws, medical standards and regulatory requirements, including the regulation of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and treatment; and\n\u2022the acceptability of data obtained from studies conducted outside the U.S. to the FDA in support of a BLA.\nIf we fail to successfully meet requirements for the conduct of clinical trials outside of the U.S., we may be delayed in obtaining, or be unable to obtain, regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nWe may encounter substantial delays in our clinical trials, or we may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidates for the intended indications. Clinical testing is expensive, time consuming and uncertain as to outcome. We cannot guarantee that clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include:\n\u2022delays caused by us or third parties in conducting clinical trials for GEN-011, GEN-009 or any future product candidates;\n\u2022delays in reaching, or failure to reach, a consensus with regulatory agencies on trial design;\n\u2022delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022delays in obtaining required IRB approval at each clinical trial site;\n\u2022imposition of a clinical hold by regulatory agencies or an IRB for any reason, including safety concerns raised by other clinical trials of similar cell therapies or vaccines that may reflect an unacceptable risk with GEN-011, GEN-009 or any future product candidates, or after an inspection of clinical operations or trial sites;\n\u2022insufficiency of data collected from clinical trials to support the BLA submission or to obtain regulatory approval;\n\u2022failure of clinical trial results to meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u2022failure to perform in accordance with the FDA\u2019s GCPs or applicable regulatory guidelines in other countries;\n\u2022delays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of the product candidates to the clinical sites;\n\u2022delays caused by patients not completing participation in a trial or not returning for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022clinical trial sites or patients dropping out of a trial or failing to complete dosing;\n\u2022occurrence of serious AEs in clinical trials that are associated with the product candidates that are viewed to outweigh its potential benefits; or\n\u2022changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols.\nDelays, including delays caused by the above factors, can be costly and could negatively affect our ability to complete a clinical trial. We cannot give any assurance that we will be able to resolve any delay caused by the factors described above or any other factors, on a timely basis or at all. If we are not able to successfully initiate and complete subsequent clinical trials, we will not be able to obtain regulatory approval and will not be able to commercialize our product candidates.\nOur product candidates, GEN-011 and GEN-009, and our future potential product candidates arising out of our immuno-oncology program, are or will be based on T cell activation, which is a novel approach for cellular therapies, vaccines, immunotherapies and medical treatments.\nWe have concentrated our research and development efforts on T cell immunotherapy and vaccine technology, which is a novel approach for cellular therapies, vaccines, immunotherapies and medical treatments, and our future success is highly dependent on the successful development of T cell immunotherapies in general, and our active development product and current and future product candidates in particular. Consequently, it may be difficult for us to predict the time and cost of product development. Unforeseen problems with the T cell approach to cellular therapies and vaccines may prevent further development or approval of our current and future product candidates. There can be no assurance that any development problems we or others researching T cell cellular therapies and vaccines may experience in the future will not cause significant delays or unanticipated costs, or that such development problems can be solved. Because of the novelty of this approach, there may be unknown safety risks associated with the cellular therapies and vaccines that we develop. Regulatory agencies such as the FDA may require us to conduct extensive safety testing prior to approval to demonstrate a low risk of rare and severe AEs caused by the cellular therapies and vaccines. If approved, the novel mechanism of action of the cellular therapies and vaccines may adversely affect physician and patient perception and uptake of our products.\nOur product candidates are uniquely manufactured for each patient, and we may encounter difficulties in manufacturing and scaling our manufacturing capabilities. If we or any of the third-party manufacturers with whom we contract encounter these types of difficulties, our ability to provide our product candidates for clinical trials or our products for patients, if approved, could be delayed or stopped, or we may be unable to maintain a commercially viable cost structure. Some of our third-party manufacturers are located outside the U.S., and we may encounter disruption in clinical material supplies due to logistics, as well as risk of adverse regulatory action due to local regulatory oversight.\nWe custom design and manufacture our product candidates. Manufacturing unique lots of these product candidates is susceptible to product loss or failure due to issues with:\n\u2022logistics associated with the collection of a patient\u2019s tumor or blood;\n\u2022batch-specific manufacturing failures or issues that arise due to the uniqueness of each patient-specific batch that may not have been foreseen;\n\u2022quality control testing failures;\n\u2022unexpected failures of batches placed on stability;\n\u2022novel assays, cell selection or other components within our manufacturing processes;\n\u2022significant costs associated with individualized manufacturing that may adversely affect our ability to continue development;\n\u2022successful and timely manufacture and release of the patient-specific batch;\n\u2022shipment issues encountered during transport of the batch to the site of patient care; and\n\u2022our reliance on single-source suppliers.\nAs our product candidates are manufactured for each individual patient, we will be required to maintain a chain of identity with respect to each patient\u2019s sample, including the sequence data derived from such samples, the results of such patient\u2019s immunologic profile, and the custom drug product manufactured for each patient. Maintaining such a chain of identity is difficult and complex, and failure to do so could result in product mix-up, adverse patient outcomes, loss of product, or regulatory action, including withdrawal of any approved products from the market. Further, as our product candidates are developed through early-stage clinical studies to later-stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, we expect that multiple aspects of the complicated collection, analysis, manufacture and delivery processes will be modified in an effort to optimize processes and results. These changes may not achieve the intended objectives, and any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform differently than we expect, potentially affecting the results of clinical trials.\nNovel vaccine adjuvants, including those in our GEN-009 product candidate, may pose an increased safety risk to patients.\nAdjuvants are compounds that are added to vaccine antigens to enhance the activation of the immune system and improve the immune response and efficacy of vaccines. Development of vaccines with novel adjuvants requires evaluation in larger numbers of patients prior to approval than would be typical for therapeutic drugs. Guidelines for evaluation of vaccines with novel adjuvants have been established by the FDA and other regulatory bodies and expert committees. Our product candidates, including GEN-009, may include one or more novel adjuvants. Any adjuvanted neoantigen cancer vaccine, because of the presence of an adjuvant, may have side effects considered to pose too great a risk to patients to warrant approval of the vaccine.\nIf we fail to obtain regulatory approval in jurisdictions outside the U.S., we will not be able to market our products in those jurisdictions.\nWe intend to market our product candidates, if approved, in international markets. Such marketing will require separate regulatory approvals in each market and compliance with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedures vary among countries and may involve requirements for additional testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates, such immunotherapies will be subject to ongoing regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, our product candidates, including GEN-011, GEN-009 and any other potential future immunotherapy product candidates, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other restrictions, and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our products.\nAny regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved indications for which the product may be marketed or to conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the immunotherapy or vaccine potentially over many years. In addition, if the FDA approves any of our product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, AE reporting, storage, import, export, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping, and monitoring for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with current good manufacturing practice (\u201ccGMP\u201d) and GCP, for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval.\nLater discovery of previously unknown problems with an approved product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing operations or processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u2022restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u2022imposition of limitations on approved uses or additional warnings, contraindications, or other safety information, or a REMS;\n\u2022fines, warning letters, or holds on clinical trials;\n\u2022refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\u2022product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n\u2022injunctions or the imposition of civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nThe FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could affect regulatory approval that we have received for our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that may have been obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties to conduct technical development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates, including GEN-011 and GEN-009, and any other future product candidates, and if they do not properly and successfully perform their obligations to us, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\nWe rely, and intend to continue to rely on, on third-party CROs and other third parties to assist in managing, monitoring and otherwise carrying out our GEN-011 and GEN-009 clinical trials. We expect to continue to rely on third parties, such as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct our clinical trials. We compete with many other companies for the resources of these third parties. The third parties on whom we rely generally may terminate their engagements at any time and having to enter into alternative arrangements would delay development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nOur reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities require compliance with regulations and standards, including GCP, for designing, conducting, monitoring, recording, analyzing, and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that the data and results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Although we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, we are responsible for ensuring that each of these clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators, and trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our future clinical trials may be deemed unreliable, and the FDA and other regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical studies before approving any marketing applications.\nFurthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their duties under their agreements, if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to clinical trial protocols or to regulatory requirements, or if they otherwise fail to comply with clinical trial protocols or meet expected deadlines, the clinical trials of our product candidates may not meet regulatory requirements. If clinical trials do not meet regulatory requirements or if these third parties need to be replaced, nonclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated. If any of these events occur, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates on a timely basis or at all.\nWe also expect to rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct some or all aspects of our product manufacturing, and these third parties may not perform satisfactorily. In some instances, we may rely on a single manufacturer for certain of our products.\nWe do not have any manufacturing facilities. We do not expect to independently conduct all aspects of our product manufacturing. We rely on third parties with respect to manufacturing GEN-011 and GEN-009, and in some instances we may rely on a single manufacturer for certain of our products. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or products or such quantities at an acceptable cost or quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nAny of these third parties may terminate their engagement with us at any time. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, it could delay our product development activities. Our reliance on these third parties for manufacturing activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibility to ensure compliance with all required regulations regarding manufacturing.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured the product candidates ourselves, including:\n\u2022the inability to negotiate manufacturing agreements with third parties under commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022reduced control as a result of using third-party manufacturers for all aspects of manufacturing activities, including regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u2022the risk that activities are not conducted in accordance with our study plans and protocols;\n\u2022termination or non-renewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us;\n\u2022the unavailability of a manufacturer that is capable of, or that has the capacity to, manufacture our clinical supply that results in delays or additional manufacturing costs;\n\u2022the possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how or infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our contract manufacturers; and\n\u2022disruptions to the operations of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers caused by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including the bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier.\nAny of these events could lead to clinical trial delays or failure to obtain regulatory approval or affect our ability to successfully commercialize future products. Some of these events could be the basis for FDA action, including injunction, recall, seizure or total or partial suspension of production.\nThird-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the U.S. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products.\nOur product candidates and any products that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us.\nAny performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or marketing approval. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply or a second source for GEN-011 and GEN-009. If our current contract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace such manufacturers. Although we believe that there are several potential alternative manufacturers who could manufacture our product candidates, we may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacement.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates or products may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nIf we are unable to manufacture our products or are unable to obtain regulatory approvals for a manufacturing facility for our products, we may experience delays in product development, clinical trials, regulatory approval and commercial distribution.\nWe expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of clinical and, if necessary, commercial quantities of our product candidates. These third-party manufacturers must also receive FDA approval before they can produce clinical material or commercial products. Our products may be in competition with other products for access to these facilities and may be subject to delays in manufacture if third parties give other products greater priority. We may not be able to enter into any necessary third-party manufacturing arrangements on acceptable terms, or on a timely basis. In addition, we may have to enter into technical transfer agreements and share our know-how with the third-party manufacturers, which can be time consuming and may result in delays.\nOur reliance on contract manufacturers may adversely affect our operations or result in unforeseen delays or other problems beyond our control. Because of contractual restraints and the limited number of third-party manufacturers with the expertise, required regulatory approvals and facilities to manufacture our cellular therapies and vaccines on a commercial scale, replacement of a manufacturer may be expensive and time consuming and may cause interruptions in the production of our cellular therapy or vaccine. A third-party manufacturer may also encounter difficulties in production. These problems may include:\n\u2022difficulties with production costs and scale-up;\n\u2022unavailability of raw materials and supplies;\n\u2022insufficient quality control and assurance;\n\u2022shortages of qualified personnel;\n\u2022failure to comply with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations that vary in each country where product might be sold; and\n\u2022lack of capital funding.\nAs a result, any delay or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be successful in establishing and maintaining strategic partnerships, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products.\nA part of our strategy is to evaluate and, as deemed appropriate, enter into partnerships in the future when strategically attractive, including potentially with major biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate partners for our product candidates, and the negotiation process is time consuming and complex. In order for us to successfully partner our product candidates, potential partners must view these product candidates as economically valuable in markets they determine to be attractive in light of the terms that we are seeking and other available products for licensing by other companies. Even if we are successful in our efforts to establish strategic partnerships, the terms that we agree upon may not be favorable to us, and we may not be able to maintain such strategic partnerships if, for example, development or approval of a product is delayed or sales of an approved product are disappointing. Any delay in entering into strategic partnership agreements related to our product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates and reduce their competitiveness even if they reach the market.\nIn addition, our strategic partners may breach their agreements with us, and we may not be able to adequately protect our rights under these agreements. Furthermore, our strategic partners will likely negotiate for certain rights to control decisions regarding the development and commercialization of our product candidates, if approved, and may not conduct those activities in the same manner as we would do so.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain strategic partnerships related to our product candidates, we will bear all of the risk and costs related to the development of any such product candidate, and we will need to seek additional financing, hire additional employees and otherwise develop expertise which we do not have and for which we have not budgeted. This could negatively affect the development of any unpartnered product candidate.\nIn addition, we are currently seeking to establish strategic partnerships with companies with adjuvant and delivery technologies for our neoantigen cancer vaccine candidates. If we are unable to successfully enter into these partnerships, our ability to develop our neoantigen cancer vaccine candidates may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to our product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, patent applications, know-how and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our platform technology and product candidates. The patent position of biotechnology companies is generally uncertain because it involves complex legal and factual considerations. The standards applied by the U.S. PTO and foreign patent offices in granting patents are not always applied uniformly or predictably. For example, there is no uniform worldwide policy regarding patentable subject matter or the scope of claims allowable in biotechnology patents. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our discovery platform or product candidates in the U.S. or in other countries. There is no assurance that all potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications or those of our licensors has been found, and prior art that we have not disclosed could be used by a third party to invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. Even if patents do successfully issue and even if such patents cover our discovery platform or product candidates, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed or invalidated. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications, or those of our licensors, may not adequately protect our platform technology, provide exclusivity for our product candidates, prevent others from designing around our patents with similar products, or prevent others from operating in jurisdictions in which we did not pursue patent protection. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business.\nIf patent applications we hold or have in-licensed with respect to our platform or product candidates fail to issue, if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened, or if they fail to provide meaningful exclusivity for our product candidates or ATLAS discovery platform, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us and could limit or destroy our ability to develop or commercialize one or more of our products, or even any product. We or our licensors have filed several patent applications covering aspects of our product candidates. We cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will be issued, the breadth of any such patents or whether any issued patents will be found invalid and unenforceable or will be challenged by third parties. Any successful opposition to these patent applications, or patents that may issue from them, or to any other patent applications or patents owned by or licensed to us, could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of any product candidate that we may develop. Since patent applications in the U.S. and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, and some remain so until issued, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to file a patent application relating to any particular aspect of a product candidate.\nIn the U.S., for patent applications filed prior to March 16, 2013, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first to invent is entitled to the patent, while outside the U.S., the first to file a patent application is entitled to the patent. On March 16, 2013, the U.S. transitioned to a \u2018first to file\u2019 system more like that in the rest of the world in that the first inventor to file a patent application is entitled to the patent. Under either the prior system or current one, third parties are allowed to submit prior art prior to the issuance of a patent. Furthermore, both the U.S. and foreign patent systems permit third parties or, in some cases, the patent authorities themselves, to initiate proceedings challenging the scope and/or validity of issued patents, including for example, opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review or interference proceedings. An adverse determination against our or our licensor's patent rights in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, which could adversely affect our competitive position with respect to third parties.\nIn addition, patents have a limited lifespan. In most countries, including the U.S., the natural expiration of a patent is 20 years from the date it is filed. Various extensions of patent term may be available in particular countries, however in all circumstances the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, has a limited term. If we encounter delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market a product under patent protection could be reduced. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms where these are available in any countries where we are prosecuting patents. Such possible extensions include those permitted under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 in the U.S., which permits a patent term extension of up to five years to cover an FDA-approved product. However, the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the U.S., and any equivalent regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. If this occurs, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and nonclinical data, and then may be able to launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case.\nFiling, prosecuting and enforcing patents on our platform or product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the U.S. could be less extensive than those in the U.S. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the U.S. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing our patents in all countries outside the U.S., or from selling or importing products that infringe our patents in and into the U.S. or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the U.S. These products may compete with our products, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nAny loss of, or failure to obtain, patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. We may be unable to prevent competitors from entering the market with a product that is similar to or the same as our products.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to defend or enforce our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights, and competitors or other third parties may challenge the validity or enforceability of those rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, or to defend against other challenges, litigation may be necessary to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets and/or to determine the validity and scope of our own intellectual property rights or the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation can be expensive and time consuming. Many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to litigate intellectual property rights than we can. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, which could harm our business and financial results. In addition, in contested proceedings, a court or agency may decide that a patent owned by or licensed to us is invalid or unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates, and to use our or our licensors\u2019 proprietary technologies without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the U.S., involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions, reexamination, and inter partes review proceedings before the U.S. PTO and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing and may develop our product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims for example to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture, methods of analysis, and/or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our products or product candidates. In some cases, we may have failed to identify such relevant third-party patents or patent applications. For example, applications filed before November 29, 2000 and certain applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the U.S. remain confidential until patents issue. Except for the preceding exceptions, patent applications in the U.S. and elsewhere are generally published only after a waiting period of approximately 18 months after the earliest filing. Therefore, patent applications covering our platform technology or our products or product candidates could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally, pending patent applications which have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our platform technologies, our products or product candidates and/or the use, analysis, and/or manufacture of our product candidates.\nIf any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our materials, formulations, methods of manufacture, methods of analysis, and/or methods for treatment, the holders of any such patents would be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate until such patent expired or unless we obtain a license. Such licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms.\nParties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Defending against claims of patent infringement or misappropriation of trade secrets could be costly and time consuming, regardless of the outcome. Thus, even if we were to ultimately prevail, or to settle at an early stage, such litigation could burden us with substantial unanticipated costs. In addition, litigation or threatened litigation could result in significant demands on the time and attention of our management team, distracting them from the pursuit of other company business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure.\nWe may face a claim of misappropriation if a third party believes that we inappropriately obtained and used trade secrets of such third party. If we are found to have misappropriated a third party\u2019s trade secrets, we may be prevented from further using such trade secrets, limiting our ability to develop our product candidates, and we may be required to pay damages. During the course of any patent or other intellectual property litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, rulings on motions, and other interim proceedings in the litigation. If securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the perceived value of our products, programs, or intellectual property could be diminished. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nWe have in-licensed a portion of our intellectual property, and, if we fail to comply with our obligations under these arrangements, or our licensors fail to obtain and maintain intellectual property rights, we could lose such intellectual property rights or owe damages to the licensor of such intellectual property.\nWe are a party to a number of license and collaboration agreements that are important to our business, and we may enter into additional license or collaboration agreements in the future. For example, our discovery platform is built, in part, around patents exclusively in-licensed from academic or research institutions. See \u201cBusiness - License Agreements\u201d for a description of our in-license agreement with Harvard. These and other licenses may not provide exclusive rights to use such intellectual property and technology in all relevant fields of use and in all territories in which we may wish to develop or commercialize our technology and product candidates in the future. It is possible that we may be unable to obtain additional licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. As a result, we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing and commercializing competitive products in territories included in all of our licenses. In that event, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to redesign our product candidates or to develop or license replacement technology, all of which may not be feasible on a technical or commercial basis. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected product candidates, which could harm our business significantly.\nOur existing license agreements impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty and other obligations on us. For example, in our existing license agreements, and we expect in our future agreements, patent prosecution of our licensed technology may be controlled by the licensor, and we may be required to reimburse the licensor for their costs of patent prosecution. If our licensors fail to obtain and maintain patent or other protection for the proprietary intellectual property we license from them, we could lose our rights to the intellectual property or our exclusivity with respect to those rights, and our competitors could market competing products covered by the intellectual property. Further, in our license agreements we may be responsible for bringing any actions against any third party for infringing the patents we have licensed. If there is any conflict, dispute, disagreement or issue of nonperformance between us and our licensing partners regarding our rights or obligations under the license agreements, including any such conflict, dispute or disagreement arising from our failure to satisfy payment obligations under any such agreement, we may owe damages, our licensor may have a right to terminate the affected license, and our ability to utilize the affected intellectual property in our drug discovery and development efforts, and our ability to enter into collaboration or marketing agreements for an affected product candidate, may be adversely affected. For example, disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues; the extent to which our technology infringes the intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement; the sublicensing of patent and other rights under any collaborative development relationships; our diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations; the inventorship or ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners; and the priority of invention of patented technology. If disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and third parties may not prevent unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that may not be patentable or that we may elect not to patent, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our platform technology and discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific advisors, contractors and collaborators. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our know-how, our employees, consultants, outside scientific advisors, contractors, or collaborators might intentionally or inadvertently disclose our know-how information to competitors. In addition, competitors may otherwise gain access to our know-how or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques.\nEnforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our know-how is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the U.S. sometimes are less willing than U.S. courts to protect know-how. Misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our know-how could impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nOur future commercial success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, among physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for GEN-011, GEN-009 or any other products that we may develop or acquire in the future, the product may not gain market acceptance among physicians, third-party payors, patients and others in the medical community. In addition, market acceptance of any approved products depends on a number of other factors, including:\n\u2022the efficacy and safety of the product, as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u2022the clinical indications for which the product is approved, and the label approved or licensed by regulatory authorities for use with the product, including any limitations or warnings that may be required on the label;\n\u2022acceptance by physicians and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment, the size of the target patient population, and the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe new therapies;\n\u2022the cost, safety and efficacy of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u2022the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors and government authorities;\n\u2022relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of adverse side effects;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022 publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments; and\n\u2022the restrictions on the use of our products together with other medications, or restrictions on the use of our products in certain types of patients, if any.\nMarket acceptance is critical to our ability to generate significant revenue. Any product candidate, if approved and commercialized, may be accepted in only limited capacities or not at all. If any approved products are not accepted by the market to the extent that we expect, we may not be able to generate significant revenue and our business would suffer.\nIf we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates if and when they are approved.\nWe do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure and have no experience in the sale, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any product for which we have obtained marketing approval, we will need to establish a sales and marketing organization.\nIn the future, we expect to build a focused sales and marketing infrastructure to market or co-promote some of our product candidates in the U.S., if and when they are approved. There are risks involved with establishing our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include:\n\u2022our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians;\n\u2022the lack of adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future products;\n\u2022the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u2022unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we are unable to establish our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, and instead enter into arrangements with third parties to perform these services, our product revenues and our profitability, if any, are likely to be lower than if we were to market, sell and distribute any products that we develop ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell, market and distribute our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\nCoverage and reimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for our product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell our products profitably.\nMarket acceptance and sales of any approved products will depend significantly on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors and may be affected by existing and future healthcare reform measures. Third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, private health insurers and managed care organizations, decide for which drugs they will provide coverage and establish reimbursement levels. Coverage and reimbursement decisions by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor\u2019s determination that use of a product is:\n\u2022a covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u2022safe, effective and medically necessary;\n\u2022appropriate for the specific patient;\n\u2022cost-effective; and\n\u2022neither experimental nor investigational.\nThird-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. Coverage and reimbursement can vary significantly from payor to payor. As a result, obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from each government and other third-party payor may require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that we will be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. We cannot be sure that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be available for any of our product candidates. Also, we cannot be sure that coverage determinations or reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for or require us to lower the price of or provide discounts on, our products. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to commercialize certain of our products. In addition, in the U.S., third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether and how much third-party payors will reimburse patients for their use of newly approved drugs, which in turn will put pressure on the pricing of drugs.\nThe impact of healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and in healthcare spending on us is currently unknown and may adversely affect our business model.\nIn the U.S., the legislative landscape continues to evolve. Our revenue prospects could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy in the U.S. We operate in a highly regulated industry and new laws or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws or decisions, related to healthcare availability, the method of delivery or payment for healthcare products and services could negatively impact our business, operations and financial condition. There is significant interest in promoting healthcare reform, as evidenced by the enactment in the U.S. of the Healthcare Reform Act, as well as by the ongoing efforts to eliminate or significantly modify the Healthcare Reform Act and specific initiatives focused on drug pricing. See \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation-Reimbursement\u201d. It is likely that federal and state legislatures within the U.S. will continue to consider changes to existing healthcare legislation.\nWe cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the Healthcare Reform Act or other federal and state reform efforts within the U.S. There is no assurance that healthcare reform will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future legislative, judicial or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\nThe continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of health care may adversely affect:\n\u2022the demand for any drug products for which we may obtain regulatory approval;\n\u2022our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products;\n\u2022our ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement approval for a product;\n\u2022our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability; and\n\u2022the level of taxes that we are required to pay.\nIn addition, other broader legislative changes have been adopted that could have an adverse effect upon, and could prevent, our products\u2019 or product candidates\u2019 commercial success. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (as amended, the \"Budget Control Act\") includes provisions intended to reduce the federal deficit, including reductions in Medicare payments to providers through 2030 (except May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022). Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid, or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs, or any significant taxes or fees imposed as part of any broader deficit reduction effort or legislative replacement to the Budget Control Act, or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our anticipated product revenues.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before, or more successfully, than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. Our future success depends on our ability to demonstrate and maintain a competitive advantage with respect to the design, development and commercialization of our product candidates. Our objective is to design, develop and commercialize new products with superior efficacy, convenience, tolerability and safety. In many cases, the products that we commercialize will compete with existing, market-leading products.\nOther companies that are seeking to identify antigens for the development of T cell therapies and vaccines include Achilles Therapeutics Ltd., Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc, BioNTech SE, CureVac AG, F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Genentech, Inc., Gritstone Oncology Inc., Iovance Biotherapeutics Inc., Instil Bio, Inc., Lyell Immunopharma, Inc., Merck & Co., Inc., Moderna Inc., Neogene Therapeutics, B.V., Nouscom AG, PACT Pharma Inc., Vaccibody AS and Ziopharm Oncology Inc.\nMany of our potential competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, drug development, technical and human resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical companies, in particular, have extensive experience in clinical testing, including recruiting patients, obtaining regulatory approvals, and in manufacturing pharmaceutical products. In particular, these companies have greater experience and expertise in securing government contracts and grants to support their research and development efforts, conducting testing and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals to market products, manufacturing such products on a broad scale and marketing approved products. These companies also have significantly greater research and marketing capabilities than we do and may also have products that have been approved or are in late stages of development and have collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions. Established pharmaceutical companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make any products that we develop obsolete. As a result of all of these factors, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection and/or FDA approval or discovering, developing and commercializing products before we do. In addition, any new product that competes with an approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability, and safety to overcome price competition and to be commercially successful. If we are not able to compete effectively against potential competitors, our business will not grow, and our financial condition and results of operations will suffer.\nOur products may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit their commercial potential.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our products or even competing products in development that utilize a common mechanism of action could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities and potential product liability claims. Serious AEs deemed to be caused by our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on the development of our product candidates and our business as a whole. In November 2021, we reported that GEN-009 has been well tolerated with only mild AEs associated with the vaccine adjuvant; however, we continue to monitor patients and do not yet know whether GEN-009 may cause additional AEs or more serious AEs. In addition, we do not yet know whether GEN-011 may cause AEs or serious AEs.\nIf we or others identify undesirable side effects caused by any of our product candidates either before or after receipt of marketing approval, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022our clinical trials may be put on hold;\n\u2022we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may withdraw or limit approvals of our cellular therapies or vaccines;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;\n\u2022a REMS plan to mitigate risk may be required, which could include a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools;\n\u2022we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u2022our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of our products and could substantially increase commercialization costs.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur level of indebtedness and debt service obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and may make it more difficult for us to fund our operations.\nOn February 18, 2021 (the \"2021 Loan Closing Date\"), we entered into a loan and security agreement (the \"2021 Loan Agreement\") with Silicon Valley Bank (\"SVB\") for a $10.0 million secured term loan (the \"2021 Term Loan\"). $9.0 million of the proceeds from the 2021 Term Loan were used to repay the borrowings that were outstanding at the 2021 Loan Closing Date under our previous loan and security agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc. (as amended, the \"Hercules Loan Agreement\"), paying off all obligations owing under, and extinguishing, the Hercules Loan Agreement on the 2021 Loan Closing Date. The remaining proceeds from the 2021 Term Loan of $1.0 million were received by us for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nThis indebtedness may create additional financing risk for us, particularly if our business or prevailing financial market conditions are not conducive to paying off or refinancing our outstanding debt obligations at maturity or in the event of an acceleration of the 2021 Term Loan. This indebtedness could also have important negative consequences, including the fact that:\n\u2022we will need to repay our indebtedness by making payments of interest and principal, which will reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations, our research and development efforts and other general corporate activities; and\n\u2022our failure to comply with the covenants in the 2021 Term Loan could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our obligation to repay this indebtedness, and SVB could seek to enforce its security interest in the assets securing such indebtedness.\nWe may not have cash available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make interest or principal payments on our indebtedness when due. If we do not make scheduled payments when due, or otherwise experience an event of default under the 2021 Term Loan, SVB could accelerate our total loan obligation or enforce its security interest against us.\nFailure to satisfy our current and future debt obligations under the 2021 Term Loan could result in an event of default. In addition, other events, including certain events that are not entirely in our control, such as the occurrence of a material adverse event on our business, could cause an event of default to occur. As a result of the occurrence of an event of default, SVB could accelerate all of the amounts due under the 2021 Term Loan. In the event of such an acceleration, we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to repay our indebtedness. In addition, all obligations under the 2021 Term Loan are secured by substantially all of our property, excluding our intellectual property (but including proceeds from our intellectual property). SVB could seek to enforce its security interests in the assets securing such indebtedness. If we are unable to pay amounts due to SVB upon acceleration of the 2021 Term Loan or if SVB enforces its security interest against our assets securing our indebtedness to SVB, our ability to continue to operate our business may be jeopardized.\nWe are subject to certain restrictive covenants which, if breached, could result in the acceleration of our debt under the 2021 Term Loan and have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nThe 2021 Term Loan imposes operating and other restrictions on us. Such restrictions will affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, our ability and the ability of any future subsidiary to, among other things:\n\u2022dispose of certain assets;\n\u2022change our lines of business;\n\u2022engage in mergers or consolidations;\n\u2022make investments;\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022create liens on assets;\n\u2022pay dividends and make distributions or repurchase our capital stock; and\n\u2022engage in certain transactions with affiliates.\nThese restrictive covenants may prevent us from undertaking an action that we believe is in our best interests. In addition, if we were to breach any of these restrictive covenants, SVB could accelerate our indebtedness under the 2021 Term Loan or enforce its security interest against our assets, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operating.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nIf we fail to attract and keep senior management and key scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop our products, conduct our clinical trials and commercialize our product candidates.\nWe are highly dependent on members of our senior management, including William Clark, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Thomas Davis, M.D., our Chief Medical Officer, Jessica Flechtner, Ph.D., our Chief Scientific Officer, and Raymond D. Stapleton, Jr., Ph.D., our Chief Technology Officer. The loss of the services of any of these persons could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives. We have employment agreements with each of these members of senior management.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing, sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms, based on the status of our clinical development programs and the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, commercial partners, and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraudulent or other illegal activity by our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, commercial partners, and vendors. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct that fails: to comply with the regulations of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory bodies; to provide true, complete and accurate information to the FDA and similar foreign regulatory bodies; to comply with manufacturing standards we have established; to comply with federal, state and foreign healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations; to report financial information or data accurately; or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, the promotion, sale and marketing of healthcare items and services, as well as certain business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent misconduct, including fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of patient recruitment for clinical trials. It is not always possible to identify and deter such misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.\nAs we seek to advance our product candidates through clinical trials and commercialization, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively and hire, train and integrate additional management, administrative and, if necessary, sales and marketing personnel. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any products. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even a successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u2022injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022significant costs to defend the related litigations;\n\u2022a diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022product recalls, withdrawals, or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022loss of revenue;\n\u2022the inability to commercialize any product candidates that we may develop; and\n\u2022a decline in our stock price.\nFailure to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products we develop. We currently carry product liability insurance covering our clinical trials in the amount of $5.0 million in the aggregate. Although we maintain product liability insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We will have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts.\nWe must comply with environmental laws and regulations, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities.\nWe use hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials in certain aspects of our business and are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, distribution, storage, handling, treatment and disposal of these materials. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from the use, manufacture, distribution, storage, handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous materials. In the event of contamination or injury, or failure to comply with environmental, occupational health and safety and export control laws and regulations, we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any such liability could exceed our assets and resources. We are uninsured for third-party contamination injury.\nWe must comply with data protection laws and regulations, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions, private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to data protection laws and regulations that address privacy and data security. The legislative and regulatory landscape for data protection continues to evolve, and in recent years there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data security issues. In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as amended, the \"CCPA\") went into operation on January 1, 2020 and broadly defines personal information. The CCPA gives California consumers (defined to include all California residents) certain rights, including the right to receive certain details regarding the processing of their data by covered companies, the right to request deletion of their data, and the right to opt out of sales of their data. The CCPA additionally imposes several obligations on covered companies to provide notice to California consumers regarding their data processing activities. The CCPA provides for imposition of substantial fines on companies that violate the law and also confers a private right of action on data subjects to seek statutory or actual damages for breaches of their personal information. These protections will be expanded by the California Privacy Rights Act, which was approved by California voters in November 2020 and will be operational in most key respects on January 1, 2023, along with laws passed in Virginia and Colorado. Similar legislative proposals are being advanced in other states, as well as in Congress. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions, which could include civil or criminal penalties, private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may obtain health information from third parties (e.g., healthcare providers who prescribe our products) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (collectively, \u201cHIPAA\u201d). While we have determined that we are neither a \u201ccovered entity\u201d nor \u201cbusiness associate\u201d directly subject to HIPAA, we have assumed contractual obligations related to protecting the privacy of personal information obtained from such sources. As HIPAA\u2019s criminal provisions may also apply to entities other than \u201ccovered entities\u201d or \u201cbusiness associates\u201d in certain circumstances, we could be subject to legal action or criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted.\nA pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has and may in the future adversely affect our business.\nOur operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases, such as the current outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19. The Center for Disease Control (\"CDC\") has recognized this outbreak as a pandemic, which has caused shutdowns to businesses and cities worldwide while disrupting supply chains, business operations, travel, consumer confidence, and business sentiment. The situation is ever evolving, and its short-term and long-term effects remain unknown. The spread of COVID-19 has resulted in certain disruptions to our business and may result in future additional disruptions to our business. Examples of both include without limitation the following:\n\u2022The health and well-being of our employees and suppliers is at risk. If a critical threshold of our personnel, or the personnel of our suppliers, were to be diagnosed with COVID-19, placed in quarantine due to potential exposure to COVID-19, or need to care for family members diagnosed with COVID-19, it may result in significant manufacturing and business disruption.\n\u2022Our clinical sites may experience delays in the enrollment of new patients, which could have a material impact on our GEN-011 program.\n\u2022We have asked most employees who are not directly involved in our clinical and Inhibigens programs to work from home, which could impact our ability to effectively plan, execute, and communicate business plans and strategies, and could also impact our ability to maintain our corporate culture. The increase in working remotely could increase our cybersecurity risk, create data accessibility concerns, and make us more susceptible to communication disruptions, any of which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\n\u2022The possibility that certain country borders may close or significantly reduce cross-border traffic in response to COVID-19, which could affect certain of our manufacturers and suppliers\u2019 ability to provide product and supplies to us on a timely basis.\nThe full extent to which COVID-19 will directly or indirectly affect our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain or treat COVID-19, and its economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets.\nDisruption of our supply chain could negatively impact our business.\nOur ability to procure materials necessary for our business and clinical trials, including our GEN-011 clinical trial, on a timely basis is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to raw material supplies or manufacturing or distribution chains due to weather, climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, cyberattack, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), governmental restrictions or mandates, strikes, import/export restrictions, or other factors could impair our ability to procure supplies necessary for our business, or otherwise cause delays or shortages. The failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who manufacture or supply our products, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, may negatively impact our operations and clinical trials, including our GEN-011 clinical trial. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is manufactured or supplied from a single location, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire, retain or deploy key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new or modified products from being developed, cleared or approved, or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and clear or approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, statutory, regulatory, and policy changes, the FDA\u2019s ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and other events that may otherwise affect the FDA\u2019s ability to perform routine functions. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for marketing applications, clinical trial authorizations or other regulatory submissions to drug candidates to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, including for 35 days beginning on December 22, 2018, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical employees and stop critical activities.\nSeparately, in response to the global pandemic of COVID-19, on March 10, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to postpone most foreign inspections of manufacturing facilities and products through April 2020, and subsequently, on March 18, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to temporarily postpone routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities. In July 2021, the FDA stated that it had begun transitioning back to standard operations for domestic inspections, while continuing to prioritize mission-critical work for foreign inspections. The FDA may not be able to maintain this pace, and further delays or setbacks are possible in the future. As a result, review, inspection, and other timelines for our product candidates may be materially delayed for an unknown period of time. Regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our marketing applications, clinical trial authorizations, or other regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur largest stockholder, New Enterprise Associates (\u201cNEA\u201d), could exert significant influence over us and could limit other stockholders' ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including any change of control.\nOur largest stockholder, NEA, beneficially owns, in the aggregate, shares representing approximately 24% of our outstanding common stock as of March 15, 2022. In addition, one member of our board of directors is associated with NEA. As a result, we expect that NEA will be able to exert significant influence over our business. NEA may have interests that differ from other stockholders' interests, and it may vote in a way with which other stockholders disagree and that may be adverse to other stockholders' interests. The concentration of ownership of our capital stock may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf our stock price is volatile, our stockholders could incur substantial losses, and we may become involved in securities-related litigation, including securities class action litigation, that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm our business and subject us to significant liabilities.\nOur stock price is likely to be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, our stockholders could incur substantial losses. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022the success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u2022results of clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u2022the timing of the release of results of our clinical trials;\n\u2022results of clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022regulatory actions or legal developments with respect to our products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022the results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license additional product candidates or products;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022publication of research reports by securities analysts about us or our competitors or our industry;\n\u2022our failure or the failure of our competitors to meet analysts\u2019 projections or guidance that we or our competitors may give to the market;\n\u2022additions and departures of key personnel;\n\u2022strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;\n\u2022the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments affecting us or our industry;\n\u2022fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022sales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders;\n\u2022speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u2022changes in accounting principles;\n\u2022terrorist acts, acts of war or periods of widespread civil unrest;\n\u2022natural disasters and other calamities;\n\u2022changes in market conditions for biopharmaceutical stocks; and\n\u2022changes in general market and economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market has recently experienced significant volatility, particularly with respect to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences company stocks. The volatility of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences company stocks often does not relate to the operating performance of the companies represented by the stock. As we operate in a single industry, we are especially vulnerable to these factors to the extent that they affect our industry or our products, or to a lesser extent our markets.\nFurther, any future lawsuits or litigation could result in substantial costs, divert our resources and management's attention, and require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation.\nFailure to comply with The Nasdaq Capital Market continued listing requirements may result in our common stock being delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nAs of March 15, 2022, our stock price had closed below $1.00 within the last 10 business days. To maintain listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we are required, among other things, to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share. If the closing bid price of our common stock is below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, we will receive a deficiency notice from Nasdaq advising us that we have a certain period of time, typically 180 days, to regain compliance by maintaining a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 for at least ten consecutive business days, although Nasdaq could require a longer period.\nIf we fail to maintain compliance with these, or any other of the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, Nasdaq may take steps to de-list our common stock. Such a de-listing would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair investors' ability to sell or purchase our common stock when they wish to do so.\nOur failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements which could require us to restate financial statements, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on our stock price.\nWe cannot provide assurance that any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The existence of a material weakness or significant deficiency could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of being a public company, and our management expects to devote substantial time to public company compliance programs.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, insurance, accounting and other expenses. In addition, our administrative staff are required to perform additional tasks. We invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment could result in increased general and administrative expenses and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from product development activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be harmed. Due to the recent changes in the stockholder class action landscape, director and officer liability insurance has been more expensive. If this trend continues we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations. In the event that we are not able to demonstrate compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, that our internal control over financial reporting is perceived as inadequate, or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our operating results and the price of our ordinary shares could decline. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on Nasdaq.\nWe are required to comply with certain of the SEC\u2019s rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment must include the disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by our management or our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we engage in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that we will not be able to conclude, within the prescribed timeframe or at all, that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404. If we identify one or more material weaknesses, it could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statement.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and could prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation (the \"Certificate of Incorporation\") and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022authorize \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022create a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors, our chief executive officer or our president;\n\u2022prohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022provide that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n\u2022provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u2022specify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors;\n\u2022expressly authorize our board of directors to modify, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022require supermajority votes of the holders of our common stock to amend specified provisions of our bylaws.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision of our Certificate of Incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation designates the state or federal courts located in the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the state and federal courts located in the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our Certificate of Incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or (4) any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Further, our Certificate of Incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be the source of gain for our stockholders.\nInvestors should not rely on an investment in our common stock to provide dividend income. We do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Instead, we plan to retain any earnings to maintain and expand our operations. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends is currently restricted by the terms of our debt financing arrangement, and any future debt financing arrangement may contain terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our common stock. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any return on their investment. As a result, investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or security breaches could adversely affect our business.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information (including, among other things, trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information). It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We also have outsourced elements of our operations to third parties, and as a result we manage a number of third-party vendors who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology systems, and those of third-party vendors with whom we contract, and the large amounts of confidential information stored on those systems, make such systems vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, consultants, third-party vendors, and/or business partners, or from cyberattacks by malicious third parties. Cyberattacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. Cyberattacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Cyberattacks could also include phishing attempts or email fraud to cause payments or information to be transmitted to an unintended recipient.\nSignificant disruptions of our information technology systems, or those of our third-party vendors, or security breaches could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss, misappropriation and/or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, confidential information, including, among other things, trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. For example, any such event that leads to unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our patients or employees, could harm our reputation, require us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information. Security breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. While we have implemented security measures to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent service interruptions or security breaches that could adversely affect our business.\nWe cannot predict what the market price of our common stock will be and, as a result, it may be difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares of our common stock.\nAn inactive market may impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock and may impair our ability to enter into strategic partnerships or acquire companies or products by using our shares of common stock as consideration. We cannot predict the prices at which our common stock will trade. It is possible that in one or more future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and, as a result of these and other factors, the price of our common stock may fall.", "PERMNO": 14458, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "GNCA"}
