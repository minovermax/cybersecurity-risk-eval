{"cik": "1669812", "company": "LSC Communications, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-19", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows can be adversely affected by various risks. These risks include the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K. You should carefully consider all of these risks.\nRisks Relating to the Business of the Company\nThe highly competitive market for our products and industry fragmentation may continue to create adverse price pressures.\nThe markets for the majority of our product categories are highly fragmented and we have a large number of competitors. Management believes that excess capacity in our markets, as well as increasing consolidation of our customer base has caused downward price pressure for our products and that this trend is likely to continue. In addition, consolidation in the markets in which we compete may increase competitive price pressures due to competitors lowering prices as a result of synergies achieved.\nWe may be unable to improve our operating efficiency rapidly enough to meet market conditions.\nBecause the markets in which we compete are highly competitive, we must continue to improve our operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve our profitability. There is no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. In addition, the need to reduce ongoing operating costs may result in significant up-front costs to reduce workforce, close or consolidate facilities, or upgrade equipment and technology, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.\nThe substitution of electronic delivery for printed materials may continue to adversely affect our businesses.\nElectronic delivery of documents and data, including the online distribution and hosting of media content, offer alternatives to traditional delivery of print materials. Consumers continue to accept electronic substitution in directory printing and are replacing traditional reading of print materials with online, hosted media content or e-reading devices. The extent to which consumers will continue to accept electronic delivery is uncertain and it is difficult to predict future rates of acceptance of these alternatives. Electronic delivery has negatively impacted some of our products, such as directories and books. Digital technologies have also impacted printed magazines, as some advertising spending has started transitioning from print to electronic media. To the extent that consumers and customers continue to accept these alternatives, our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nGlobal market and economic conditions, as well as the effects of these conditions on our customers\u2019 businesses, could adversely affect us, as the financial condition of our customers may deteriorate.\nGlobal economic conditions affect our customers\u2019 businesses and the markets they serve. Because a significant part of our business relies on advertising spending, which is driven in part by economic conditions and consumer spending, a prolonged downturn in the global economy and an uncertain economic outlook could further reduce the demand for the printing and related services that we provide. Delays or reductions in customers\u2019 spending would have an adverse effect on demand for our products and services, which could be material, and consequently could negatively impact our results of consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows. Economic weakness and constrained advertising spending may result in decreased net sales, operating margin, earnings and growth rates and difficulty in managing inventory levels and collecting accounts receivable. Our exposure to industries experiencing financial difficulties and certain financially troubled customers could negatively impact our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows. Further, a lack of liquidity in the capital markets or a sustained period of unfavorable economic conditions could increase our exposure to credit risks of our customers and result in increases in bad debt write-offs and allowances for doubtful accounts receivable. We may experience operating margin declines, reflecting the effect of items such as competitive price pressures, inventory write-downs, cost increases for wages and materials, and increases in pension plan funding requirements. Economic downturns may also result in restructuring actions and associated expenses and impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles. Uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments.\nAdverse credit market conditions may limit the Company\u2019s ability to obtain future financing.\nWe may, from time to time, depend on access to the credit markets. Uncertainty and volatility in global financial markets may cause financial markets institutions to fail or may cause lenders to hoard capital and reduce lending. The failure of a financial institution that supports the Company\u2019s existing credit agreement would reduce the size of its committed facility unless a replacement institution were added.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with seasonality, which could negatively impact our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.\nOur sales and cash flows are affected by seasonality, as print demand is affected by advertising and consumer spending trends. Historically, demand for printing of magazines, catalogs, retail inserts, books and office products is higher in the second half of the year, driven by increased advertising pages within magazines, holiday volume in catalogs and retail inserts, and back-to-school demand in books and office products. These typical seasonal patterns can be impacted by overall trends in the U.S. and world economy. For these reasons, sequential quarterly comparisons are not a good indication of our performance or how we may perform in the future. If we are unable to obtain access to financing sources to fund our working capital needs or if seasonal fluctuations are greater than anticipated, this could negatively impact our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.\nIncreases in the prices of paper, ink, energy and other raw materials may adversely impact us.\nPurchases of paper, ink, energy and other raw materials represent a large portion of our costs. Increases in the prices of these inputs may increase our costs, and we may not be able to pass these increased costs on to customers through higher prices, or to the extent we pass along such costs by increasing our prices to our customers, it may adversely impact customers\u2019 demand for our printing and related services.\nDecreases in the market prices for waste paper or other byproducts may adversely impact us.\nDecreases in the prices paid by third parties for waste paper and other print-related byproducts may make it infeasible for us to sell, or adversely impact the amounts we are paid, from sales of such byproducts.\nWe may be adversely affected by a decline in the availability of raw materials.\nWe are dependent on the availability of paper, ink and other raw materials to support our operations. Unforeseen developments in these markets could result in a decrease in the supply of paper, ink or other raw materials and could cause us to be unable to meet contractual commitments to our customers or result in a decline in our net sales.\nWe rely on a key supplier for ink and if such supplier breaches or is unable to perform certain obligations under our arrangement with them, we may be unable to procure comparable supply from another supplier in a timely fashion, or when we are able to procure such supply, such supply may be on worse terms.\nA significant portion of our ink comes from a single supplier pursuant to a multi-year supply agreement. The ink industry has faced significant challenges in recent years, as the demand for ink has declined while the costs of raw materials used to manufacture ink have fluctuated. We rely on this ink supplier to meet a significant portion of our ink needs, and have negotiated a contract that provides us with favorable terms and certain contingencies from supply disruption. A disruption in the supply of ink from this supplier, either from natural disaster, financial bankruptcy or other supply interruption, may require us to purchase a significant amount of ink from other suppliers or assume the production ourselves, which in either case, may be on worse terms and slow our production, either of which could have a negative impact on our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.\nWe have in the past acquired and intend in the future to acquire other businesses and we may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of these businesses and may not achieve the cost savings and increased net sales anticipated as a result of these acquisitions.\nAchieving the anticipated benefits of acquisitions will depend in part upon our ability to integrate these businesses in an efficient and effective manner. The integration of companies that have previously operated independently may result in significant challenges, and we may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully. In particular, the coordination of geographically dispersed organizations with differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration. The integration of acquired businesses may also require the dedication of significant management resources, which may temporarily distract management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operations of the Company. In addition, the process of integrating operations may cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of the Company\u2019s businesses and the loss of key personnel from the Company or the acquired businesses. Further, employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration process may disrupt the businesses of the Company or the acquired businesses.\nThe Company\u2019s strategy is, in part, predicated on the Company\u2019s ability to realize cost savings and to increase net sales through the acquisition of businesses that add to the breadth and depth of the Company\u2019s products and services. Achieving these cost savings and net sales increases is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. In particular, the Company may not be able to realize the benefits of more comprehensive product and service offerings, anticipated integration of sales forces, asset rationalization and systems integration.\nWe may be subject to more intensive competition if our competitors pursue consolidations.\nWe currently have a large number of competitors in the markets in which we operate. We believe that selectively pursuing acquisitions is an important strategy for our business, as evidenced by our pending merger with Quad/Graphics. If our competitors are able to successfully combine with one another, and we are not successful with our own efforts to consolidate or adapt effectively to increased competition, the competitive landscape we face could be significantly altered. Such consolidation could create stronger competitors with greater financial resources and broader manufacturing and distribution capabilities than our own, and the resulting increase in competitive pressures could negatively impact our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.\nOur business is dependent upon brand recognition and reputation, and the failure to maintain or enhance our brands or reputation would likely have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur brand recognition, particularly in our Office Products segment, and reputation generally are important aspects of our business. Maintaining and further enhancing our brands and reputation will be important to retaining and attracting customers for our products. We also believe that the importance of our brand recognition and reputation for products will continue to increase as competition in the market for our products continues to increase. Our success in this area will be dependent on a wide range of factors, some of which are out of our control, including our ability to retain existing and obtain new customers and strategic partners, the quality and perceived value of our products, actions of our competitors, and positive or negative publicity. Our reputation also depends on the quality of our customer service, and if our customer service declines, our reputation may also decline. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and could negatively impact our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to hire and retain talented employees, including management.\nOur success depends, in part, on our general ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain skilled employees. The loss of a significant number of our employees or the inability to attract, hire, develop, train and retain skilled personnel could have a serious negative effect on our business. Various locations may encounter competition with other manufacturers for skilled labor. Many of these manufacturers may be able to offer significantly greater compensation and benefits or more attractive lifestyle choices than we offer. In addition, many members of our management have significant industry experience that is valuable to our competitors. Our executive officers have non-solicitation agreements contractually prohibiting them from soliciting our customers and employees for a specified period of time after they leave the Company. If one or more members of our senior management team leave and cannot be replaced with a suitable candidate quickly, we could experience difficulty in managing our business properly, which could negatively impact our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.\nCatastrophic events may damage or destroy our factories, distribution centers or other facilities, which may disrupt our business.\nNatural disasters, conflicts, wars, terrorist attacks, fires or other catastrophic events could cause damage or disruption to our factories, distribution centers or other facilities, which may adversely affect our ability to manage logistics, cause delays in the delivery of products and services to our customers, and create inefficiencies in our supply chain. An event of this nature could also prevent us from maintaining ongoing operations and from performing critical business functions. While we maintain backup systems and operate out of multiple facilities to reduce the potentially adverse effect of these types of events, a catastrophic event that results in the destruction of any of our major factories, distribution centers or other facilities could affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, which could negatively impact our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.\nThere are risks associated with operations outside the United States.\nNet sales from our operations in geographic regions outside the United States accounted for approximately 9% of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. As a result, we are subject to the risks inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including the impact of economic and political instability of those countries in which we operate. Our operations outside of the United States during the year ended December 31, 2018 were primarily in Poland and Mexico. As mentioned in Item 1, Business, the Company completed the sale of its European printing business on September 28, 2018. Security disruptions within the regions in Mexico in which we operate may interfere with operations, which could negatively impact our supply chain.\nWe are also subject to risks that could materially affect our operations and operating results with respect to potential changes in United States government trade policy and legislation, including changes to tax laws, withdrawal from or modification of certain international trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d), the imposition of additional tariffs or other restrictions on trade on goods produced outside the United States for import into the United States and any changes in diplomatic relations with countries in which we operate or do business and compliance with applicable anti-corruption and sanctions laws and regulations.\nWe are exposed to risks related to potential adverse changes in currency exchange rates.\nWe are exposed to market risks resulting from changes in the currency exchange rates of the currencies in the countries in which we do business. Although operating in local currencies may limit the impact of currency rate fluctuations on the operating results of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, fluctuations in such rates may affect the translation of these results into our consolidated financial statements. To the extent borrowings, sales, purchases, net sales and expenses or other transactions are not in the applicable local currency, we may enter into foreign currency spot and forward contracts to hedge the currency risk. Management cannot be sure, however, that our efforts at hedging will be successful, and such efforts could, in certain circumstances, lead to losses.\nThe trend of increasing costs to provide health care and other benefits to our employees may continue.\nWe provide health care and other benefits to our employees. For many years, costs for health care have increased more rapidly than general inflation in the U.S. economy. If this trend in health care costs continues, our cost to provide such benefits could increase, adversely impacting our profitability. Changes to health care regulations in the U.S. may also increase our cost of providing such benefits. The full effect that a full or partial repeal of the Affordable Care Act or changes to other healthcare laws and regulations would have on our business remains unclear at this time, and could negatively impact our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.\nChanges in market conditions, changes in discount rates, or lower returns on assets may increase required pension plan contributions in future periods.\nThe funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain interest rates. As experienced in prior years, declines in the market value of the securities held by the plans coupled with historically low interest rates have substantially reduced, and in the future could further reduce, the funded status of the plans. These reductions may increase the level of expected required pension plan contributions in future years. Various conditions may lead to changes in the discount rates used to value the year-end benefit obligations of the plans, which could partially mitigate, or worsen, the effects of lower asset returns. If adverse conditions were to continue for an extended period of time, our costs and required cash contributions associated with pension plans may substantially increase in future periods.\nA decline in our expected profitability or the expected profitability of our individual reporting units could result in the impairment of assets, including goodwill, other long-lived assets and deferred tax assets.\nWe hold goodwill, other long-lived assets and deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. A decline in expected profitability, particularly if there is a decline in the global economy, could call into question the recoverability of our related goodwill, other long-lived tangible and intangible assets or deferred tax assets and require the write-down or write-off of these assets or, in the case of deferred tax assets, recognition of a valuation allowance through a charge to income. Such an occurrence has had and could continue to have a negative impact on our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.\nChanges in postal rates, regulations and delivery systems may adversely impact demand for our products and services.\nPostal costs are a significant component of many of our customer\u2019s cost structure. Postal rate changes and USPS regulations that result in higher overall costs can influence the volume that these clients will be willing to print and ultimately send through the USPS.\nCurrent federal law limits postal rate increases (outside of an \"exigent circumstance\") to the increase in the Consumer Price Index. This cap works to ensure funding stability and predictability for mailers. Under this current federal law, the USPS implemented a rate adjustment in early 2019 affecting all market dominant classes (periodicals, standard mail, first class mail, package services and special services), which was based on an average inflation-based rate increase for each class of mail.\nIn December 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury released the White House Task Force report on the United States Postal System. The report provides a series of recommendations to overhaul the United States Postal Service\u2019s business model in order to return it to sustainability without shifting additional costs to taxpayers. The effects of this report on postal rates, regulations and delivery systems are not yet known.\nFederal law requires the Postal Regulatory Commission (\"PRC\") to conduct a periodic review of the overall rate-making structure for the USPS. The PRC issued a proposal in 2018 to increase inflation-based pricing to include an additional 2% - 5% per year. The proposal remains open and it is not known whether the PRC will move forward with such proposal or make modifications. Until the PRC's final determination, mailers have an uncertain future relative to budgeting for postal expenses.\nThe result of such determination may be reduced demand for printed products, co-mail and freight services as our customers may move more aggressively into other delivery methods such as the many digital and mobile options now available to consumers, which may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to environmental regulation and environmental compliance expenditures, which could increase our costs and subject us to liabilities.\nThe conduct of our businesses is subject to various environmental laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local government agencies in the United States, as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets in which we operate. These laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change, sometimes dramatically, as a result of political, economic or social events. Changes in laws, regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business and, therefore, may impact our results or increase our costs and liabilities.\nVarious laws and regulations addressing climate change are being considered at the federal and state levels. Proposals under consideration include limitations on the amount of greenhouse gas that can be emitted. Such proposals may have a negative impact on our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows if capital spend or increased resources are required for compliance.\nThe competitiveness, success and growth of our business may depend on our ability to refurbish or replace our infrastructure, which could result in an increase in our capital expenditures and such capital expenditures could be substantial. We may be required to invest more in capital expenditures than we have done historically.\nCapital expenditures, such as software upgrades or machinery replacements, may be necessary from time to time to preserve the competitiveness, success and growth of our business. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and is expected to remain competitive. We may be required to invest amounts in capital expenditures that exceed our recent spending levels to replace worn out or obsolete machinery or otherwise remain competitive. If cash from operations is insufficient to provide for needed levels of capital expenditures and we are unable to obtain funds for such purposes elsewhere, we may be unable to make necessary upgrades or repairs to our software and facilities. An increase in capital expenditures could affect our ability to compete effectively and could have a negative impact on our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.\nThe failure to adapt to technological changes to address the changing demands of customers or the failure to implement new required processes or procedures in connection with the expansion of our products and services into new areas may adversely impact our business.\nMany of the end markets in which our customers compete are experiencing changes due to technological progress and changes in consumer preferences. In order to remain competitive, we will need to continue to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address the changing demands of customers. If we are unable to continue to exploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors or adapt to new distribution methods, our business may be adversely affected.\nTechnological developments, changing demands of customers and the expansion of our products and services into new areas may require additional investment in new equipment and technologies, as well as the implementation of additional necessary or required compliance procedures and processes to which we are not currently subject. The development of such solutions may be costly and there is no assurance that these solutions will be accepted by customers. Furthermore, our compliance with new procedures and processes may increase our costs and, in the event we are unable to comply, may reduce our customers\u2019 willingness to work with us. If we are unable to adapt to technological changes on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, or if we cannot comply with these necessary or required procedures or processes, customers\u2019 demand for our products and services may be adversely affected.\nOur services depend on the reliability of computer systems maintained by us and our vendors and the ability to implement and maintain information technology and security measures to protect against security breaches and data leakage.\nWe depend on our information technology and data processing systems to operate our business, and a significant malfunction or disruption in the operation of our systems, or a security breach or a data leak that compromises the confidential and sensitive information of ours and of our customers stored in those systems, could disrupt our business, harm our reputation with customers and adversely impact our ability to compete. These systems include systems that we own and operate, as well as those systems of our vendors.\nOur systems are integral to the operation of our business, because they allow us to share information that may be confidential in nature to our customers across our offices worldwide, which allows us to increase global reach for our customers, or they allow us to offer products that are dependent upon access to the systems. Such systems are susceptible to malfunctions and interruptions due to equipment damage, power outages and a range of other hardware, software and network problems. Those systems are also susceptible to cybercrime, or threats of intentional disruption, which are increasing in terms of sophistication and frequency. Our systems are also susceptible to breaches due to intentional employee misconduct. For any of these reasons, we may experience systems malfunctions or interruptions or leakage of confidential information. A significant or large-scale malfunction or interruption of any one of our computer or data processing systems, or the leakage of confidential information due to a malfunction or breach of our systems or employee misconduct, could adversely affect our ability to manage and keep our operations running efficiently, and damage our reputation if we are unable to track transactions, deliver products and safeguard our customers\u2019 confidential information. A malfunction that results in a wider or sustained disruption to our business could negatively impact our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.\nIn addition, we may from time to time acquire companies or businesses that do not have cybersecurity practices and procedures consistent with ours, and we may need to invest in bringing those businesses onto our existing systems or updating them to comply with ours. Such systems may be more vulnerable to attack or malfunction than our systems until such time as we are able to integrate the business.\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness and the degree to which we are currently leveraged may materially and adversely affect our business and consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.\nWe have $767 million of indebtedness as of December 31, 2018. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the debt incurred in connection with the separation, as well as any future debt that we may incur, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not generate sufficient funds to service our debt and meet our business needs, such as funding working capital or the expansion of our operations. If we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due we may be forced to take disadvantageous actions, including facility closures, staff reductions, reducing financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, selling assets or dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, and restricting future capital return to stockholders. In addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in the print and related services industry could be impaired. The lenders who hold our debt could also accelerate amounts due in the event that we default, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity of our other debt.\nIn addition, our leverage could put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be less leveraged. These competitors could have greater financial flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions and secure additional financing for their operations. Our leverage could also impede our ability to withstand downturns in our industry or the economy in general.\nThe agreements and instruments that govern our debt impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe Credit Agreement that governs our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture that governs the Senior Secured Notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends, make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nincur or permit to exist certain liens;\n\u2022\nenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nThese covenants can have the effect of limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete. In addition, the Credit Agreement that governs our Senior Secured Credit Facilities requires us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants. Operating results below current levels or other adverse factors, including a significant increase in interest rates, could result in our being unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in our Term Loan Facility and indenture. If we violate covenants under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and indenture and are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders, our debt under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and indenture would be in default and could be accelerated by our lenders. Because of cross-default provisions in the agreements and instruments governing our debt, a default under one agreement or instrument could result in a default under, and the acceleration of, our other debt.\nIf our debt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If our debt is in default for any reason, our business and consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of the notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nThe anticipated changes to London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) after 2021 could impact the cost of our variable rate indebtedness.\nSome of our debt, including our credit facility, has a variable rate of interest linked to the LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. In July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. It is likely that banks will not continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 and possible that they may not provide submissions before then. It is impossible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what effects any changes to LIBOR or the transition to alternative reference rates may have on the on variable rate credit facility loans or on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The consequence of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness.\nIf LIBOR rates are no longer available or viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, and our lenders are required, or exercise discretion, to implement substitute reference rates for the calculation of interest rates under our credit facility, we may incur significant expenses in effecting the transition, and may be subject to disputes or litigation with lenders over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute reference rates, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDespite our substantial indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt.\nDespite our substantial amount of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt, in the future. Although the indenture governing our Senior Notes and the Credit Agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities restrict the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions. Also, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we had $214 million available for additional borrowing under our Revolving Facility. The more indebtedness we incur, the further exposed we become to the risks associated with substantial leverage described above.\nThe ongoing effects of the Tax Act and the refinement of provisional estimates could make our results difficult to predict.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate in the future as a result of the Tax Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act introduced significant changes to U.S. income tax law that had a meaningful impact on our provision for income taxes. Further, the U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and other standard-setting bodies may issue guidance or regulations on how the provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. Accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act requires significant judgments and estimates in the interpretation and calculations of the provisions of the Tax Act.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nWe cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nThe timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends to LSC Communications stockholders will fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board\u2019s decisions regarding the payment of future dividends will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, future prospects, earnings, capital requirements and debt service obligations, as well as legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that our Board deems relevant. In addition, the terms of the agreements governing our debt or debt that we may incur in the future may continue to limit or prohibit the payment of dividends. While our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per common share on January 17, 2019 payable on March 4, 2019, there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a dividend.\nDelaware law and anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents may discourage our acquisition by a third party, which could make it more difficult to acquire us and limit your ability to sell your shares at a premium.\nCertain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that is opposed by our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series with such rights, obligations and preferences as the board of directors may determine, without further vote or action by our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe initial classification of our board of directors, which effectively prevents stockholders from electing a majority of the directors at any one annual meeting of stockholders until the second annual meeting of stockholders after the separation;\n\u2022\nadvanced notice procedures for stockholders to nominate candidates for election to the board of directors and for stockholders to submit proposals for consideration at a meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\ninability of stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nthe absence of cumulative voting rights for our stockholders.\nWe are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d between a publicly-held Delaware corporation and an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation\u2019s voting stock for a three-year period following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder. This statute, as well as the provisions in our organizational documents, could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing certain potential acquisitions or a change in control of us.\nStockholders\u2019 percentage ownership in LSC Communications may be diluted in the future.\nStockholders\u2019 percentage ownership in LSC Communications may be diluted in the future because of equity securities we issue, either as consideration for acquisitions, in connection with capital raises or for equity awards that we may grant to our directors, officers and employees. Further, to the extent that LSC Communications raises additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, existing ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of such financings may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of existing stockholders. Any such transaction will dilute stockholders\u2019 ownership in LSC Communications.\nRisks Relating to the Merger\nBecause the exchange ratio is fixed and because the market price of Quad/Graphics class A common stock may fluctuate, LSC stockholders cannot be certain of the precise value of the merger consideration they may receive.\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, at the time the merger is consummated, each eligible share of LSC common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.625 shares of Quad/Graphics class A common stock, subject to adjustment for any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in capitalization. The exchange ratio will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of Quad/Graphics class A common stock or LSC common stock prior to the consummation of the merger. If the merger is consummated, there will be a time lapse between each of the date of the Company\u2019s Proxy Statement relating to the Merger, as filed with the SEC on January 22, 2019 (the \u201cMerger Proxy\u201d), the dates on which LSC stockholders vote to approve the merger agreement proposal at the LSC special meeting and Quad/Graphics shareholders vote to approve the share issuance proposal at the Quad/ Graphics special meeting, and the date on which LSC stockholders entitled to receive the merger consideration actually receive the merger consideration. The market value of shares of Quad/Graphics class A common stock may fluctuate during and after these periods as a result of a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in Quad/Graphics\u2019 businesses, operations and prospects and regulatory considerations. Such factors are difficult to predict and in many cases may be beyond the control of Quad/Graphics and LSC. Consequently, at the time LSC stockholders must decide whether to approve the merger agreement proposal, they will not know the actual market value of any merger consideration they will receive when the merger is consummated. The actual value of any merger consideration received by LSC stockholders at the consummation of the merger will depend on the market value of the shares of Quad/Graphics class A common stock at that time. This market value may differ, possibly materially, from the market value of shares of Quad/Graphics class A common stock at the time the merger agreement was entered into or at any other time. LSC stockholders should obtain current stock quotations for shares of Quad/Graphics class A common stock before voting their shares of LSC common stock.\nThe market price of Quad/Graphics class A common stock will continue to fluctuate after the merger.\nUpon consummation of the merger, holders of LSC common stock who receive the merger consideration will become holders of shares of Quad/Graphics class A common stock. The market price of Quad/Graphics class A common stock may fluctuate significantly following consummation of the merger and holders of LSC common stock could lose some or all of the value of their investment in Quad/Graphics class A common stock.\nLSC stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in Quad/Graphics following the merger compared to their ownership in LSC and will exercise less influence over management.\nCurrently, LSC stockholders have the right to vote in the election of LSC\u2019s board of directors and the power to approve or reject any matters requiring stockholder approval under Delaware law and under LSC\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Upon consummation of the merger, each LSC stockholder who receives the merger consideration will become a shareholder of Quad/Graphics with a percentage ownership of Quad/Graphics that is smaller than the LSC stockholder\u2019s current percentage ownership of LSC. Based on the number of issued and outstanding shares of Quad/Graphics class A common stock and the number of shares of LSC common stock outstanding as of January 7, 2019, and the exchange ratio, after the merger, LSC stockholders are expected to, collectively, become owners of approximately 29.6% of the economic ownership of Quad/Graphics following the merger, and approximately 11.1% of the voting power of Quad/Graphics following the merger, in each case, without giving effect to any shares of Quad/Graphics class A common stock held by LSC stockholders prior to the consummation of the merger. Even if all former LSC stockholders voted together on all matters presented to Quad/Graphics shareholders, the former LSC stockholders would exercise significantly less influence over Quad/Graphics after the consummation of the merger relative to their influence over LSC prior to the consummation of the merger, and thus would have a less significant impact on the approval or rejection of future Quad/Graphics proposals submitted to a shareholder vote. Further, while Quad/Graphics has agreed under the merger agreement to increase the size of the Quad/Graphics board of directors in order to cause two current members of the LSC board of directors mutually agreed by LSC and Quad/Graphics, at the direction of the trustees of the Quad/Graphics voting trust, to be appointed to the Quad/Graphics board of directors, there is no assurance that such directors will remain as members of the Quad/Graphics board of directors beyond their initial term.\nShares of Quad/Graphics class A common stock received by LSC stockholders as a result of the merger will have different rights from shares of LSC common stock.\nUpon consummation of the merger, LSC stockholders will no longer be stockholders of LSC and will become shareholders of Quad/Graphics. There are important differences between the current rights of LSC stockholders and the rights to which such stockholders will be entitled as shareholders of Quad/Graphics. For a discussion of the different rights associated with the shares of Quad/Graphics class A common stock, see the section entitled \u201cComparison of the Rights of Quad/Graphics Shareholders and LSC Stockholders\u201d in the Merger Proxy.\nThe merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the merger may not be consummated.\nThe merger agreement is subject to a number of conditions that must be fulfilled in order to consummate the merger, which are described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Consummation of the Merger\u201d in the Merger Proxy. Those conditions include, among others: (i) the adoption of the merger agreement by LSC stockholders, (ii) the approval of the share issuance proposal by Quad/Graphics\u2019 shareholders, (iii) the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, and other required regulatory approvals, (iv) the absence of any governmental order or law that precludes, restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits, the consummation of the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and (v) Quad/Graphics\u2019 shares of class A common stock issuable in the merger having been approved for listing on the NYSE. These conditions to the closing of the merger may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly the merger may be delayed or may not be consummated.\nIn addition, the parties can mutually decide to terminate the merger agreement at any time, before or after obtaining shareholder approval, or, if the merger is not consummated by October 30, 2019, either Quad/Graphics or LSC may choose to terminate the merger agreement and not proceed with the merger. Quad/Graphics or LSC may also elect to terminate the merger agreement in certain other circumstances as further detailed in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Termination\u201d in the Merger Proxy.\nThe merger agreement limits LSC\u2019s ability to pursue alternatives to the merger.\nThe merger agreement contains provisions that may discourage a third party from submitting an acquisition proposal (as defined in the section titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Non-Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals; Changes of Recommendation-Definition of Acquisition Proposal\u201d in the Merger Proxy) to LSC that might result in greater value to LSC stockholders than the merger, or may result in a potential competing acquirer of LSC proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire LSC than it might otherwise have proposed to pay. These provisions include a general prohibition on LSC soliciting or, subject to certain exceptions relating to the exercise of fiduciary duties by the LSC board of directors, furnishing information with respect to LSC or entering into discussions with any third party regarding any acquisition proposal or offer for a competing transaction. LSC also has an unqualified obligation to submit the merger agreement proposal to a vote by LSC stockholders, even if LSC receives an alternative acquisition proposal that the LSC board of directors believes is superior to the merger, unless the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms prior to such time. In the event that LSC terminates the merger agreement to enter into an alternative acquisition that the LSC board of directors believes is superior to the merger, LSC will be required by the merger agreement to pay Quad/Graphics a termination fee of $12.5 million plus reimburse Quad/Graphics up to $2 million for reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses related to the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.\nFailure to consummate the merger could negatively impact the stock price and the future business and financial results of Quad/Graphics and LSC.\nThe merger agreement contains a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to the consummation of the merger. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions to the consummation of the merger will be so satisfied or waived. If the conditions to the merger are not satisfied or waived, Quad/Graphics and LSC will be unable to consummate the merger and the merger agreement may be terminated.\nIf the merger is not consummated for any reason, the ongoing businesses of LSC may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having consummated the merger, LSC will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nLSC may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on the market price of shares of LSC common stock;\n\u2022\nthe manner in which customers, vendors, business partners and other third parties perceive LSC may be negatively impacted, which in turn could affect LSC\u2019s marketing operations and their ability to compete for new business or obtain renewals in the marketplace more broadly;\n\u2022\ncustomers, suppliers and other third parties who have business relationships with LSC may decide not to renew such relationships or seek to terminate, change and/or renegotiate their relationships with LSC as a result of the transaction, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with LSC or otherwise;\n\u2022\nLSC may experience negative reactions from employees;\n\u2022\nLSC may be required to pay Quad/Graphics a termination fee of $12.5 million and reimburse Quad/Graphics for its out-of-pocket expenses up to $2 million, and LSC may only receive from Quad/Graphics a termination fee of $45 million if the merger is terminated under certain circumstances;\n\u2022\nLSC may be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, even if the merger is not consummated;\n\u2022\nunder the merger agreement, LSC is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of their businesses prior to consummating the merger, which may affect our ability to execute certain of their business strategies; and\n\u2022\nthe attention of LSC management may be directed towards the consummation of the merger and merger-related considerations and may be diverted from the day-to-day business operations of LSC, and matters related to the merger may require commitments of time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that might have been beneficial to LSC. If the merger is not consummated, the price of LSC common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will be consummated and that the related benefits will be realized, or to the extent there is a market perception that the merger was not consummated due to an adverse change in the business of LSC.\nThe regulatory approvals required for the consummation of the merger may not be obtained or may take longer than expected to be received. In addition, an adverse outcome of any antitrust or similar review undertaken by a governmental authority could prevent the merger from being consummated or have an adverse effect on Quad/Graphics following the merger.\nConsummation of the merger is conditional upon receipt of certain regulatory approvals, including, without limitation, the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act in the United States and Mexico antitrust approval. Although Quad/Graphics and LSC have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals, there can be no assurance that these approvals will be obtained.\nIn addition, the regulatory authorities from which these approvals are required may impose conditions on the consummation of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger. In attempting to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals, neither Quad/Graphics nor any of its subsidiaries will be required to make any divestiture, sale or other disposition of its assets or businesses. However, although it is not required under the merger agreement to do so, if Quad/Graphics agrees to such conditions in order to obtain any approvals required to consummate the merger, then the business and results of operations of Quad/Graphics following the merger may be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances as further detailed in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Termination\u201d in the Merger Proxy due to failure to obtain regulatory approvals or the material breach of Quad/Graphics of its obligations in respect of obtaining regulatory approvals, Quad/Graphics will pay LSC a reverse termination fee of $45 million.\nThe synergies expected to be produced may not be realized or may require Quad/Graphics after the consummation of the merger to incur additional costs that may adversely affect the value of Quad/Graphics\u2019 class A common stock.\nThe success of the merger will depend, in part, on Quad/Graphics\u2019 ability to realize the synergies expected to be produced from integrating LSC\u2019s businesses with Quad/Graphics\u2019 existing business through capacity rationalization, the elimination of duplicative functions, greater operational efficiencies and greater efficiencies in supply chain management, among other areas. Quad/Graphics has identified approximately $135 million of annualized net synergies that are expected to be achieved in less than 24 months after the consummation of the merger.\nQuad/Graphics\u2019 management estimates that the total cost to Quad/Graphics of achieving the annualized net synergies will be approximately $135 million in integration costs. Quad/Graphics\u2019 estimates are based on a number of assumptions, which may prove incorrect.\nFollowing the merger, Quad/Graphics may also incur additional and/or unexpected costs in order to realize the anticipated synergies. While Quad/Graphics\u2019 management believes that the annualized net synergies are achievable, it may be unable to realize all of the synergies within the time frame expected or at all. The integration process will be complex, costly and time-consuming. The difficulties of integrating LSC\u2019s businesses may include, among others:\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information, communications, and other systems;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain key employees, which might adversely affect operations and the ability to retain other employees;\n\u2022\npreserving significant business relationships;\n\u2022\nconsolidating corporate and administrative functions; and\n\u2022\nother unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities.\nQuad/Graphics may not accomplish the integration of LSC\u2019s businesses smoothly, successfully or within the anticipated cost range or timeframe. The diversion of the attention of Quad/Graphics\u2019 management from current operations to the integration effort and any difficulties encountered in combining operations could prevent Quad/Graphics from realizing the full benefits anticipated to result from the merger and could adversely affect its business.\nQuad/Graphics and LSC will incur significant transaction and merger-related costs in connection with the merger, which may be in excess of those anticipated.\nBoth Quad/Graphics and LSC have incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with negotiation and consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including financial and legal advisor fees, financing costs and the costs and expenses of filing, printing and mailing of the joint proxy statement/prospectus relating to the Merger.\nQuad/Graphics and LSC expect to continue to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with consummating the merger, combining the operations of the two companies and achieving desired synergies. These fees and costs have been, and will continue to be, substantial. The substantial majority of the non-recurring expenses will consist of transaction costs related to the merger and include, among others, financing costs, employee retention costs, fees paid to financial, legal, and public relations advisors, severance and benefit costs and filing fees.\nQuad/Graphics and LSC will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans. Additional unanticipated costs also may be incurred while the merger is pending and for a period thereafter for the integration of the two companies\u2019 businesses. Although Quad/Graphics and LSC expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow the companies to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near-term, or at all. Certain of these costs will be borne by each of Quad/Graphics and LSC even if the merger is not consummated\nLawsuits have been filed against LSC, the LSC board of directors, Quad/Graphics and merger sub challenging the adequacy or completeness of the disclosures made in the initial version of the joint proxy/prospectus filed in connection with the merger on December 11, 2018, and other lawsuits may be filed against LSC, Quad/Graphics and/or their respective boards challenging the merger. An adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may prevent the merger from being consummated.\nThree substantially similar actions were filed by an alleged LSC stockholder against some or all of LSC, the directors of LSC, Quad/Graphics and merger sub in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware challenging the adequacy or completeness of the disclosures to LSC stockholders made in the initial version of the joint proxy statement/prospectus filed on December 11, 2018 regarding the merger. Among other remedies, the plaintiffs seek to enjoin the merger until additional information relating to the merger is disclosed.\nAdditional lawsuits arising out of the merger may be filed in the future. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Transaction Litigation\u201d in the Merger Proxy for more information about litigation related to the merger that has been commenced. There can be no assurance that any of the defendants will be successful in the outcome of the pending or any potential future lawsuits. A preliminary injunction could delay or jeopardize the consummation of the merger, and an adverse judgment granting permanent injunctive relief could indefinitely enjoin the consummation of the merger.\nLSC and/or Quad/Graphics may be targets of further securities class action and derivative lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the merger from being consummated.\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into merger agreements. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgement could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on Quad/Graphics\u2019 and LSC\u2019s respective liquidity and financial condition. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting consummation of the merger, then that injunction may delay or prevent the merger from being consummated, which may adversely affect Quad/Graphics\u2019 and LSC\u2019s respective business, financial position and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 16278, "SIC": 2750, "TIC": "LKSDQ"}
