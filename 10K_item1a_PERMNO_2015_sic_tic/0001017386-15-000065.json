{"cik": "875296", "company": "LAPOLLA INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the SEC, including subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. We operate in a changing environment that involves a number of risks. Although the factors listed below are considered to be the most significant factors, they should not be considered a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our business. These known and unknown risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or liquidity, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nOur operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, which makes our operating results difficult to predict and can cause our operating results in any particular period to be less than comparable quarters and expectations from time to time.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control and have the potential to materially and adversely affect our results. Factors that affect our operating results include the following:\n\u00b7 a change in demand or production of our products caused by severe weather conditions. Sales of our products tend to be lowest during the first and fourth fiscal quarters, with sales during the second and third fiscal quarters being comparable and marginally higher;\n\u00b7 the size, timing and terms of sales and orders, especially large customer orders;\n\u00b7 variations caused by customers delaying, deferring or canceling purchase orders or making smaller purchases than expected;\n\u00b7 the spending patterns of customers;\n\u00b7 a change in the mix of our products having different margins;\n\u00b7 a change in the mix of our customers and business;\n\u00b7 changes in pricing by us or our competitors, or the need to provide discounts to win business;\n\u00b7 our ability to control costs, including operating expenses;\n\u00b7 losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by insurance;\n\u00b7 the ability and willingness of customers to pay amounts owed to us;\n\u00b7 the timing of significant investments in the growth of our business, as the revenue and profit we hope to generate from those expenses may lag behind the timing of expenditures;\n\u00b7 costs related to the acquisition and integration of companies or assets;\n\u00b7 general economic trends, including changes in construction and retrofitting spending or national or geopolitical events such as economic crises, wars or incidents of terrorism; and\n\u00b7 future accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting policies.\nAccordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results that you can expect for any other quarter or for an entire year.\nOur industries are highly competitive.\nThe spray polyurethane foam and coatings industries are highly competitive. Although we are one of the largest suppliers of spray polyurethane foam, many of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater resources than we do and are able to achieve greater economies of scale than us and may, therefore, be able to provide their products and services to customers at lower prices than we are able to. Moreover, our competitors could develop the expertise, experience and resources to offer products that are superior in both price and quality to our products. While we seek to compete by providing more state-of-the-art products, there are few technical or other barriers to prevent much larger companies in our industry from putting more emphasis on this same strategy. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able to market our business effectively in the face of competition or to maintain or enhance our competitive position within our industry, maintain our customer base at current levels or increase our customer base. Our inability to manage our business in light of the competitive forces we face could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nBecause we currently purchase a significant portion of our materials from a few suppliers, any decrease in availability of these materials could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe depend on The Dow Chemical Company, Bayer Material Science, LLC, and Yantai Wanhua Americas for a large portion of our spray polyurethane foam and acrylic coatings material purchases, and require blowing agents from Honeywell International, Inc. Any change in the availability of such materials and blowing agents, when needed to meet our manufacturing requirements, will have a significant impact on our results of operations. If any of these suppliers were to significantly cancel, delay or reduce the amount of business we do with them for any reason, there would be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe departure or loss of key personnel could disrupt our business.\nWe depend heavily on the continued efforts of Richard J. Kurtz, our chairman of the board and majority stockholder, and on executive officers who are responsible for the day-to-day management of our business. In addition, we rely on our current directors, all of whom are important to our operations and would be difficult to replace. We cannot be certain that any of these individuals will continue in their respective capacities for any particular period of time. The departure or loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business.\nGeneral global economic, credit and capital market conditions have had and could continue to have an adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the U.S. and abroad which have had, and in the future may continue to have, an adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Future negative economic conditions, as well as a slow recovery period from the current economic downturn, could lead to reduced demand for our products, increased price competition, reduced gross margins, increased risk of obsolete inventories and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenue. Disruption of the capital and credit markets may negatively impact our business, including our ability to access additional financing at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets to run or expand our business. These events may also make it more costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our equity securities and could reduce our net income by increasing our interest expense and other costs of capital. The diminished availability of credit and other capital could also affect the industries we serve and could result in reduction in sales volumes and increased credit and collection risks.\nAny acquisitions that we complete may not perform as planned and could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operations.\nA key element of our long term business strategy is to pursue strategic acquisitions in order to increase revenue and earnings. In the event of any future acquisitions, we could:\n\u00b7 issue additional securities that would dilute our current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership or provide the purchasers of the additional securities with certain preferences over those of common stockholders, such as dividend or liquidation preferences;\n\u00b7 incur debt and assume liabilities; and\n\u00b7 incur large and immediate write-offs of intangible assets, accounts receivable or other assets.\nThese events could result in significant expenses and decreased revenue, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, integrating product acquisitions and completing any future acquisitions involve numerous operational and financial risks. These risks include difficulty in assimilating acquired operations, diversion of management\u2019s attention, and the potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired operations. Furthermore, companies acquired by us may not generate financial results consistent with our management\u2019s plans at the time of acquisition. Moreover, we will need to conduct a due diligence investigation of one or more target businesses. Intensive due diligence is time consuming and expensive due to the operations, accounting, finance and legal professionals who must be involved in the due diligence process. We may have limited time to conduct such due diligence. Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business that we acquire, we cannot assure you that this diligence will uncover all material issues relating to a particular target business, or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. If our diligence fails to identify issues specific to a target business or the environment in which the target business operates, we may be forced to write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in us reporting losses. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and may not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our common stock. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants that we may be subject to as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining post-combination debt financing.\nOur revenue and demand for our products may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar.\nWe are seeking to expand globally and fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and other currencies, such as Canadian dollars, Euro currency, Czech Koruna, British Pound Sterling, and Swedish Krona, could negatively impact the amount of our revenues and earnings and demand for our products in the future. Demand also could differ materially from the Company\u2019s expectations since the Company\u2019s prices on goods sold outside the United States are typically quoted in U.S. dollars. For example, if the Canadian dollar or Euro currency appreciates relative to the U.S. dollar, the fluctuation could result in a positive impact on revenues and demand for our products in those markets. However, if the Canadian dollar or Euro currency depreciates relative to the U.S. dollar, there could be a negative impact on the revenues and demand for our products, and such depreciation relative to the U.S. dollar could stall revenue generation due to non-competitive product pricing in such target markets. The exchange rate from the U.S. dollar to other currencies has fluctuated substantially in the past and may continue to do so in the future.\nFluctuations in the price and supply of materials used to manufacture our products may reduce our profits.\nOur material costs represented approximately 74% and 74% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The principal materials purchased by us are isocyanates, polyols, catalysts, resins, titanium dioxide, and blowing agents. These materials and components are available from, and supplied by, a few sources at competitive prices. Unanticipated increases in material prices or disruptions in supply could increase production costs and adversely affect our profitability. We cannot provide any assurances that we will not experience difficulties sourcing our materials in the future.\nWe have, and expect to continue to have, credit facilities with restrictive loan covenants that may impact our ability to operate our business and to pursue our business strategies, and our failure to remain in compliance with these covenants could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness.\nWe will continue to rely on our credit facilities with Bank of America, N.A., Enhanced Jobs for Texas Fund, LLC, and Enhanced Credit Supported Loan Fund, for a significant portion of the working capital to operate our business and execute our strategy. These credit facilities contain certain covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7 undergo a change in control;\n\u00b7 incur new indebtedness or other obligations, subject to certain exceptions;\n\u00b7 pay cash dividends;\n\u00b7 create or incur new liens, subject to certain exceptions;\n\u00b7 make new acquisitions or investments in other entities, subject to certain exceptions;\n\u00b7 wind up, liquidate or dissolve our affairs;\n\u00b7 change the nature of our core business;\n\u00b7 alter our capital structure in a manner that would be materially adverse to our lenders; and\n\u00b7 make investments or advancements to affiliated or related companies.\nThe majority of the liquidity derived from our credit facilities is based on availability determined by a borrowing base formula. Specifically, the availability of credit is dependent upon eligible receivables, inventory and certain liens. We may not be able to maintain adequate levels of eligible assets to support our required liquidity. In addition, our credit facilities require us to meet certain debt covenants, including a minimum Adjusted EBITDA and fixed charge coverage ratio. Our ability to meet these financial provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. If, as or when required, we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under, or amend the covenants contained in, our credit facilities, our lenders could institute foreclosure proceedings against the assets securing borrowings under those facilities, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe indebtedness under our credit facilities with Bank of America, N.A. and Enhanced Capital are secured by substantially all of our assets. As a result of these security interests, such assets would only be available to satisfy claims of our general creditors or to holders of our equity securities if we were to become insolvent to the extent the value of such assets exceeded the amount of our indebtedness and other obligations. In addition, the existence of these security interests may adversely affect our financial flexibility.\nIndebtedness under our credit facilities with Bank of America, N.A. is secured by a first lien, and Enhanced Capital is secured by a second lien, on substantially all of our assets. Accordingly, if an event of default were to occur under our credit facilities, Bank of America, N.A. and then Enhanced Capital would have a priority right to our assets, to the exclusion of our general creditors in the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or reorganization. In that event, our assets would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations secured by them (including all amounts outstanding under our senior secured credit agreement), resulting in all or a portion of our assets being unavailable to satisfy the claims of our unsecured indebtedness. Only after satisfying the claims of our unsecured creditors and our subsidiaries\u2019 unsecured creditors would any amount be available for our equity holders. The pledge of these assets and other restrictions may limit our flexibility in raising capital for other purposes. Because substantially all of our assets are pledged under these financing arrangements, our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness or to sell or dispose of assets to raise capital may be impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our financial flexibility.\nWe rely on third parties for key elements of our business whose operations are outside our control.\nWe rely on arrangements with third party shippers and carriers such as independent shipping companies for timely delivery of our products to our customers. As a result, we may be subject to carrier disruptions and increased costs due to factors that are beyond our control, including labor strikes, inclement weather, natural disasters and rapidly increasing fuel costs. If the services of any of these third parties become unsatisfactory, we may experience delays in meeting our customers\u2019 product demands and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms. Any failure to deliver products to our customers in a timely and accurate manner may damage our reputation and could cause us to lose customers. We also utilize third party distributors and manufacturers\u2019 representatives to sell our products. While we are selective in whom we choose to represent us, it is difficult for us to ensure that our distributors and manufacturers\u2019 representatives consistently act in accordance with the standards we set for them. To the extent any of our end-customers have negative experiences with any of our distributors or manufacturers\u2019 representatives, it could reflect poorly on us and damage our reputation, thereby negatively impacting our financial results.\nWe may face impairment charges if economic environments in which our business operates and key economic and business assumptions substantially change.\nAssessment of the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets is an integral part of our normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of long-lived assets is dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects our best estimates at a particular point in time, which may vary from testing date to testing date. The economic environments in which our businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected product selling prices and materials costs, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on both the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time at which such impairments are recognized. Future changes in the economic environment and the economic outlook for the assets being evaluated could also result in additional impairment charges. Any significant asset impairments would adversely impact our financial results.\nExisting and Future litigation could impact our financial results and condition.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition could be affected by significant existing and future litigation or claims adverse to us. Types of potential litigation cases include product liability, contract, employment-related, personal injury or property damage, intellectual property, stockholder claims and claims arising from any injury or damage to persons, property or the environment from hazardous substances used, generated or disposed of in the conduct of our business. We have been in the past, and continue to be, subject to various product liability lawsuits and claims related to our products due to alleged personal injuries. Although we continue to challenge various court opinions on the subject matter, we are largely self-insured for some existing and possibly future product liability losses that may arise related to alleged personal injuries due to total pollution exclusions in our insurance policies. None of the existing allegations against us for alleged personal injuries have been proven in court. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail on any claims made against us in any such lawsuit. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of any pending lawsuits and claims, we do not believe that the disposition of any such pending matters is likely to have an adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity, although the resolution in any reporting period of one of more of these matters could have an adverse effect on our operating results for that period. Also, we can give no assurance that any other lawsuits or claims brought in the future will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or operating results.\nMarket disruptions caused by domestic or international financial crises could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at a reasonable cost and our ability to meet long-term commitments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on credit facilities with our lenders, amongst other avenues, to satisfy our liquidity needs. Disruptions in the domestic or international credit markets or deterioration of the banking industry\u2019s financial condition (such as occurred beginning in 2008), may discourage or prevent our lenders and other lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments, extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments, such as for acquisitions or to refinance existing credit facilities. Market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt securities in the capital markets. We can provide no assurances that our lenders or any other lenders we may have will meet their existing commitments or that we will be able to access the credit markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. Longer term disruptions in the domestic or international capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, reduced financing alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business. Any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged. Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing other discretionary expenditures. Market disruptions could cause a broad economic downturn that may lead to increased incidence of customers\u2019 failure to pay for services delivered, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe failure of our key computer-based systems for our administrative activities and manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe currently maintain computer-based systems in the operation of our business and we depend on these systems to a significant degree for all areas of business operations. These systems are vulnerable to, among other things, damage or interruption from fire, flood, tornado, and other natural disasters, power loss, computer system and network failures, operator negligence, physical and electronic loss of data or security breaches and computer viruses. The destruction or failure of any one of our computer-based systems for any significant period of time could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA shut down of our production could adversely affect our financial results and condition.\nWe maintain a foam resin blending and acrylic coatings production facility and are subject to various national, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Although we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with the various rules and regulations, we cannot ensure that environmental problems relating to our facility\u2019s operations will not develop in the future or, if they were to develop, would not require significant expenditures on our part. If any environmental problems should occur in the future, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nFurther, if our production facility\u2019s processing equipment breaks down or malfunctions for a prolonged period of time, we will have to rely on third party toll blenders to produce our products for us. Such alternate production methods are more costly and start up times may lead to cancellation of orders and adversely affect our business.\nOur risk management activities may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risks.\nAlthough we maintain insurance policies for our business, these policies contain deductibles and limits of coverage. Insurance liabilities are difficult to estimate due to various factors and we may be unable to effectively anticipate or measure potential risks to our company. If we suffer unexpected or uncovered losses, or if any of our insurance policies or programs are terminated for any reason or are not effective in mitigating our risks, we may incur losses that are not covered or that exceed our coverage limits and could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nWe may be unable to generate internal growth.\nOur ability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to attract new customers, increases or decreases in the number or size of orders received from existing customers, hiring and retaining skilled employees and increasing volume utilizing our existing facilities. Many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond our control, and we cannot be certain our strategies will be implemented with positive results or that we will be able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal growth. If we do not achieve internal growth, our results of operations will suffer and we will likely not be able to expand our operations or grow our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQB, and we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d. As a controlled Company, our common stock may be less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nBecause we are quoted on the OTCQB and, even if we were to be listed on a securities exchange, we believe we would qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent. Accordingly, should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded by independent directors to stockholders of companies that are not controlled companies. Our status as a controlled company could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nDelaware law and our corporate charter and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions that could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur board of directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the voting powers, preferences and other rights and limitations of the preferred stock. Accordingly, we may issue shares of preferred stock with a preference over our common stock with respect to dividends or distributions on liquidation or dissolution, or that may otherwise adversely affect the voting or other rights of the holders of common stock. Issuances of preferred stock, depending upon the rights, preferences and designations of the preferred stock, may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change of control, even if that change of control might benefit our stockholders. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Section 203 generally prohibits a public Delaware corporation from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless (i) prior to the date of the transaction, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; (ii) the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the number of shares outstanding (a) shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers and (b) shares owned by employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or (iii) on or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business combination is approved by the board and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder. Section 203 could delay or prohibit mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts with respect to us and, accordingly, may discourage attempts to acquire us even though such a transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their stock at a price above the prevailing market price.\nYour ability to influence corporate decisions may be limited because Richard J. Kurtz owns a controlling percentage of our common stock and our lenders have final authority to approve or reject certain transactions.\nOur company is controlled by Richard J. Kurtz, our chairman of the board, who beneficially owns approximately 57.5% of our outstanding common stock. As a result of this stock ownership, Mr. Kurtz can control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire. In addition, as the interests of Mr. Kurtz and our minority stockholders may not always be the same, this large concentration of voting power may lead to stockholder votes that are inconsistent with the best interests of our minority stockholders or the best interest of us as a whole. Furthermore, pursuant to the terms of our credit agreements with Bank of America, N.A. and Enhanced Capital, we are restricted from, among other things, entering into merger agreements or agreements for the sale of any or all of our assets outside the course of ordinary business. As such, even if certain corporate transactions may be approved by our stockholders, Bank of America, N.A. and Enhanced Capital, as the lenders under our credit agreement, have final authority to approve or reject certain of our transactions. This could lead to us not being able to effect certain transactions that may be in the best interests of our stockholders or our business.\nThere has been a limited market for our common stock and we cannot ensure investors that an active market for our common stock will be sustained.\nThere has been limited trading in our common stock and there can be no assurance that an active trading market in our common stock will be maintained. Due to the illiquidity of our common stock, the market price may not accurately reflect our relative value. There can be no assurance that an active market for our shares of common stock will develop in the future. Because our common stock is so thinly traded, even limited trading in our shares has in the past, and might in the future, lead to dramatic fluctuations in share price and investors may not be able to liquidate their investment in us at all or at a price that reflects the value of the business.\nOur stock price may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors.\nThe market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel, including Richard J. Kurtz, our chairman and majority stockholder;\n\u00b7 sales of our common stock, including management shares;\n\u00b7 our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u00b7 operating results that fall below expectations;\n\u00b7 loss of any strategic relationship;\n\u00b7 industry developments;\n\u00b7 economic and other external factors;\n\u00b7 our ability to manage the costs of maintaining adequate internal financial controls and procedures in connection with the acquisition of additional businesses;\n\u00b7 period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results; and\n\u00b7 announcements of acquisitions.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also significantly affect the market price of our common stock.\nOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock. Our stockholders and the holders of our options may sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market. The availability of these shares of our common stock for resale in the public market has the potential to cause the supply of our common stock to exceed investor demand, thereby decreasing the price of our common stock. In addition, the fact that our stockholders and option holders can sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, could make it more difficult for us to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends in the future. As a result, any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors as our board of directors may consider relevant. In addition, our credit agreements with Bank of America, N.A. and Enhanced Capital restrict our ability to pay cash dividends. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not currently have research coverage by securities and industry analysts and you should not invest in our common stock in anticipation that we will obtain such coverage. If we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage and if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nWe are subject to financial reporting and other requirements for which our accounting, internal audit and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared.\nWe are subject to reporting and other obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 requires us to conduct management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. These reporting and other obligations place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational, internal audit and accounting resources. Any failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price. In addition, our internal controls will also include those of any company or business that we may acquire in the future. Acquired companies or businesses are likely to have different standards, controls, contracts, procedures and policies, making it more difficult to implement and harmonize company-wide financial, accounting, information and other systems. As a result, our internal controls may become more complex and we may require significantly more resources to ensure they remain effective. Failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, either in our existing business or in businesses that we may acquire, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert management\u2019s attention.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and operating results. We may need to hire more employees in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.", "PERMNO": 89441, "SIC": 2821, "TIC": "LPAD"}
