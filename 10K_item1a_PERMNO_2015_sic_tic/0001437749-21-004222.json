{"cik": "835324", "company": "Stock Yards Bancorp, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nFACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS\nAn investment in Bancorp\u2019s common stock is subject to risks inherent in its business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this filing. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to Bancorp or that Bancorp currently deems to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations in the future. The value or market price of Bancorp\u2019s common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks, and an investor could lose all or part of their investment.\nThere are factors, many beyond Bancorp\u2019s control, which may significantly change the results or expectations of Bancorp. Some of these factors are described below, however, many are described in the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEconomic, Market and Credit Risks\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread have adversely impacted our business and financial results, and the ultimate impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created and continues to create extensive disruptions to the global economy and to the lives of individuals throughout the world. Governments, businesses, and the public are taking unprecedented actions to contain the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate its effects, including self-quarantines, travel bans, shelter-in-place orders, closures of businesses and schools, fiscal stimulus, and legislation designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief. While the scope, duration, and full effects of COVID-19 continue to evolve and are not fully known, the pandemic and related efforts to contain it have disrupted global economic activity, adversely affected the functioning of financial markets, impacted interest rates, increased economic and market uncertainty, and disrupted trade and supply chains. If these effects continue for a prolonged period, or result in sustained economic stress or recession, many of the risk factors identified in this Annual Report on Form-10-K could be exacerbated and such effects could have a material adverse impact on us in a number of ways related to credit, collateral, asset valuations, customer demand, funding, operations, interest rate risk, and human capital.\nThere are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of the impact on our business, operations or the economy as a whole. However, the effects could have a material extended impact on our business and heighten many of its known risks described below.\nFluctuations in interest rates could reduce profitability.\nOur primary source of income is from net interest spread, the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. We expect to periodically experience gaps in interest rate sensitivities of assets and liabilities, meaning that either interest-bearing liabilities may be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than interest-earning assets, or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates should move contrary to our position, this gap will work against us and earnings will be negatively affected.\nMany factors affect fluctuation of market interest rates, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf\nthe FRB\u2019s actions to control interest rates\n\u25cf\ninflation or deflation\n\u25cf\nrecession\n\u25cf\na rise in unemployment\n\u25cf\ntightening money supply\n\u25cf\nlocal, regional, national or international disorder and instability in financial markets\nThe FRB has lowered the FFTR five times since the end of 2018, resulting in a combined 225 bps decrease in the FFTR through December 31, 2020, with Prime ending the year at 3.25%. The most recent of these cuts came in March 2020 when the FRB lowered the FFTR to a range of 0% - 0.25% in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the lowest level seen since late 2015.\nMarket expectations are for the FRB to hold rates at current levels in 2021 and possibly beyond. Beyond potential ongoing pricing pressure/competition and the absolute low level of rates, the current economic outlook and prospects of a sustained zero-rate environment continues to pose challenges regarding potential ongoing NIM compression. Deposit rates tend to be tied to the short end of the rate curve, while fixed-rate loans are largely priced based upon longer term rates, typically five-year offerings. A flattening or inverted yield curve may increase our funding costs while limiting rates that can be earned on loans and investments, thereby decreasing our net interest income and earnings. Migration of deposits out of Bancorp, as customers pursue higher rates, could impact liquidity and earnings, as we compete for deposits. Changes in the mix of deposits could result in increased average rates paid on deposits, and lower earnings. Our asset-liability management strategy, which is designed to mitigate risk from changes in market interest rates, may not be able to prevent changes in interest rates from having a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe CECL accounting standard resulted in a significant change in how we recognize credit losses.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASC, \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which replaced the \u201cincurred loss\u201d model for recognizing credit losses with an \u201cexpected loss\u201d model and was adopted by Bancorp effective January 1, 2020. Whereas the incurred loss model delayed recognition of loss on financial instruments until it was probable a loss had occurred, the expected loss model recognizes a loss at the time the loan is first added to the balance sheet. Adoption of the CECL model has materially affected the determination of the ACL for loans and has resulted in a significant increase to the ACL. Assumptions made by management and material changes in economic factors could significantly influence the ACL. Any material increase to the required level of loan loss allowance could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf actual loan losses are greater than our assumption for loan losses, earnings could decrease.\nOur loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of these loans, collateral securing payment of these loans may be insufficient to ensure repayment and the wealth of guarantors providing guarantees to support these loans may be inadequate to aid in the repayment of these loans. Accordingly, we might experience significant credit losses which could have a material adverse effect on operating results. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including creditworthiness of borrowers and value of collateral for repayment. In determining the adequacy of the ACL for loans, we consider, among other factors, an evaluation of economic conditions, future national unemployment projections and our historical loan loss experience. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect or economic problems are worse than projected, the current allowance may be insufficient to cover loan losses and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in the loan portfolio. Such additions to the allowance, if necessary, could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nFederal and state regulators annually review our allowance and may require an adjustment in the ACL for loans. If regulatory agencies require any increase in the allowance for which we had not allocated, it would have a negative effect on our financial results.\nOur credit metrics are currently at historically strong levels and this trend could normalize over time.\nOver the past several years, our asset quality metrics have trended within a narrow range, exceeding benchmarks and reaching historically strong levels. We realize that present asset quality metrics are positive and, recognizing the cyclical nature of the lending business, we anticipate this trend will likely normalize over time.\nFinancial condition and profitability depend significantly on local and national economic conditions.\nOur success depends on general economic conditions both locally, regionally and nationally. A portion of our customers\u2019 ability to repay their obligations is directly tied to local, regional, national or global business dealings. Deterioration in the quality of the credit portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and ultimately capital.\nFinancial condition and profitability depend on real estate values in our market areas.\nWe offer a variety of secured loans, including C&I lines of credit, C&I term loans, real estate, C&D, HELOCs, consumer and other loans. Many of our loans are often secured by real estate primarily in our market areas. In instances where borrowers are unable to repay their loans and there has been deterioration in the value of loan collateral, we could experience higher loan losses which could have a material adverse effect on financial condition, and results of operations.\nSignificant stock market volatility could negatively affect our financial results.\nIncome from WM&T constitutes approximately 45% of non-interest income. Trust AUM are expressed in terms of market value, and a significant portion of fee income is based upon those values, which generally fluctuate consistent with overall capital markets.\nCapital and credit markets experience volatility and disruption from time to time. These conditions may place downward pressure on credit availability, credit worthiness and customers\u2019 inclinations to borrow. Prolonged volatility or a significant disruption could negatively impact customers\u2019 ability to seek new loans or to repay existing loans. Personal wealth of many borrowers and guarantors has historically added a source of financial strength to certain loans and would be negatively impacted by severe market declines. Sustained reliance on personal assets to make loan payments would result in deterioration of their liquidity, and could result in loan defaults.\nThe value of our investment securities may be negatively affected by factors outside of our control and impairment of these securities could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFactors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of our investment securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions, defaults by issuers or with respect to underlying securities, changes in market interest rates, volatility and liquidity within capital markets and changes in local, regional, national or international economic conditions. Impairment to the fair value of these securities can result in realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in other comprehensive income, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties and through transactions with counterparties in the bank and non-bank financial services industries, including broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional customers. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more bank or non-bank financial services companies, or bank or non-bank financial services industries in general, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and could result in losses or defaults by us or other institutions. These losses or defaults could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe planned phasing out of LIBOR as a financial benchmark presents risks to the financial instruments we originate or hold.\nLIBOR is the reference rate used for many of our transactions, including our lending and borrowing, as well as the derivatives that we use to manage risk related to such transactions. LIBOR will cease to exist as a published rate after 2021. The expected discontinuation of LIBOR could have a significant impact on the financial markets and market participants. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $440 million in variable rate loans with interest rates tied to LIBOR, of which approximately $330 million have maturity dates beyond December 31, 2021. Our derivative activities based upon LIBOR include interest rate swap transactions with maturities beyond 2021 with notional amounts totaling approximately $120 million.\nThe FRB, through the Alternative Reference Rate Committee, has recommended a replacement benchmark rate, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. All loan and swap contracts extending beyond 2021 will need to be managed effectively to ensure appropriate benchmark rate replacements are provided for and adopted.\nFailure to identify a replacement benchmark rate and/or update data processing systems could result in future interest rate changes not being correctly captured, which could result in interest rate risk not being mitigated as intended, or interest earned being miscalculated, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Uncertainty regarding LIBOR and discretionary actions or negotiations of fallback provisions could result in pricing volatility, adverse tax or accounting impacts, or additional compliance, legal and operational costs.\nStrategic Risks\nAcquisitions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn institution that we acquire may have asset quality issues or contingent liabilities that we did not discover or fully recognize in the due diligence process, thereby resulting in unanticipated losses. Acquisitions of other institutions also typically require integration of different corporate cultures, loan and deposit products, pricing strategies, data processing systems and other technologies, accounting, compliance, internal audit and financial reporting systems, operating systems and internal controls, marketing programs and personnel of the acquired institution. The integration process is complicated and time consuming and could divert our attention from other business concerns and may be disruptive to our customers and customers of the acquired institution. Our failure to successfully integrate an acquired institution could result in loss of key customers and employees, and prevent us from achieving expected synergies and cost savings. We may finance acquisitions with borrowed funds, thereby increasing our leverage and reducing liquidity, or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities.\nCompetition with other financial institutions could adversely affect profitability.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry that could become even more so as a result of earnings pressure from peer organizations, legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. We face vigorous competition in price and structure of financial products from banks and other financial institutions. In recent years, credit unions have expanded their lending mix and now compete heavily with banks in the CRE lending market. Non-traditional providers\u2019 high risk tolerance for fixed rate, long-term loans has adversely affected our net loan growth and results of operations. We also compete with other non-traditional providers of financial services, such as brokerage firms and insurance companies. As internet-based financial services continue to grow in acceptance, we must remain relevant as an institution where consumers and businesses value personal service while other institutions offer these services without human interaction. The variety of sources of competition may reduce or limit our margins on banking services, increase operational costs through expanded product offerings, reduce market share and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in the industry and markets in which we engage can be intense, and we may not be able to retain or hire the people wanted or needed. To attract and retain qualified employees, we must compensate them at or above market levels. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain the Company\u2019s competitive position, our performance, including the Company\u2019s competitive position, could suffer, and, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to liquidity risks.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. We rely on our ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of our loans and investment securities, respectively, to ensure we have adequate liquidity to fund our operations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, sales of investment securities, FHLB advances, sales of loans and other sources could have a significant negative effect on our liquidity.\nWe are dependent on large commercial deposit relationships as a primary funding source. Approximately 49% of our total deposits are centralized in accounts with balances $500,000 or greater. We categorize these deposits as core funds, as they represent long-standing, full-service relationships and are a testament to our commitment to partner with business customers by providing exemplary service and competitive products. A sudden shift in customer behavior within these deposits resulting in balances being reduced or exiting Bancorp altogether could impact our ability to capitalize on growth opportunities and meet current obligations. We have secondary funding sources to draw upon as needed, but the cost of those funds would be higher than typical deposit accounts, which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nExcess liquidity also poses a risk to our financial condition and results of operations. We have experienced record levels of liquidity over the past year, which is expected to continue in 2021and possibly beyond. Should loan demand not meet desired levels, excess liquidity must be invested in an effort to maximize return. The risks associated with such investment include the inability to find alternative options suitable to our risk profile, investing in alternatives that adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations, and liquidity risk associated with any specific investment. Further, holding elevated levels of liquidity can have a significant impact on our NIM and result in additional margin compression.\nWe invest in partnerships that generate federal income tax savings and these may not continue.\nWe invest in certain partnerships that yield federal income tax credits resulting in higher net income. These transactions may also include lending to developers, further enhancing profitability of the transaction. These transactions typically involve a very limited number of counterparties. Availability and suitability of these transactions are not particularly predictable and may not continue to be favorable to us. Current and future tax legislation could result in fewer transactions and the extent to which federal income tax credits favorably affect net income. Therefore, the positive effect on our net income may not continue at levels previously experienced.\nOperational Risks\nOur accounting policies and methods are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.\nAccounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying these accounting policies and methods so they comply with GAAP.\nWe have identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management\u2019s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, or reducing a liability. We have established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well-controlled and applied consistently.\nPolicies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and estimates pertaining to these matters, there can be no assurances that actual our results will not differ from those estimates. See the section titled \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for more information.\nAn extended disruption of vital infrastructure could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur operations depend upon, among other things, infrastructure, including equipment and facilities. Extended disruption of vital infrastructure by fire, power loss, natural disaster, telecommunications failure, information systems breaches, corporate account take-over, terrorist activity or the domestic and foreign response to such activity, or other events outside of our control could have a material adverse impact on the financial services industry, the economy as a whole or on our financial condition and results of operations. Our business continuity plan may not work as intended or may not prevent significant interruption of operations. Occurrence of any failures or interruptions of information systems could damage our reputation, result in loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches or incidences of fraud could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur assets, which are at risk for cyber-attacks, include financial assets and non-public information belonging to customers. Cyber security risks include cyber espionage, blackmail, ransom, theft, and corporate account takeovers. We employ many preventive and detective controls to protect our assets, and provide mandatory recurring information security training for all employees. We have invested in multiple preventative tools in an attempt to protect customers from cyber threats and corporate account takeover and regularly provide educational information regarding cyber threats to customers. We utilize multiple third-party vendors who have access to ours assets via electronic media. While we require third parties, many of whom are small companies, to have similar or superior controls in place, there is no guarantee that a breach of information could not occur. Activities of the Bank that subject Bancorp to risk of fraud by customers, employees, vendors, or members of the general public include ACH transactions, wire transactions, ATM/ITM transactions, checking transactions, credit card transactions and loan originations. Repeated incidences of fraud or a single large occurrence could adversely impact our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon outside third parties for processing and handling of the Company\u2019s records and data.\nWe rely on software developed by third-party vendors to process various transactions. In some cases, we have contracted with third parties to run their proprietary software on our behalf. While we perform a review of controls instituted by applicable vendors over these programs in accordance with industry standards and performs testing of user controls, we rely on continued maintenance of controls by these third-party vendors, including safeguards over security of client data. We may incur a temporary disruption in our ability to conduct business or process transactions, or incur reputational damage, if a third-party vendor fails to adequately maintain internal controls or institute necessary changes to systems. Such a disruption or breach of security could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, if these third-party service providers experience difficulties, or should terminate their services, and we are unable to replace them on a timely basis, our business operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, or if we incurred excessive costs involved with replacing third-party service provider, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to stay current on technological changes in order to compete and meet customer demands is constantly being challenged.\nThe financial services industry is constantly undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Future success of Bancorp will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by utilizing technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional operational efficiencies and greater privacy and security protection for customers and their personal information. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services as quickly as competitors or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. We rely on third party providers for many of our technology-driven banking products and services. Some of these companies may be slow to respond with upgrades or enhancements to their products to keep pace with improvements in technology or the introduction of competing products. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could impair our ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nChanges in customer use of banks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe rapid evolution of non-bank alternatives for initiation and completion of financial transactions puts us at risk of losing sources of revenue and funding. The ability of customers to pay bills, deposit and transfer funds, and purchase assets without utilizing the banking system could result in loss of fee income, deposits, and loans. If we are unable to continue timely development of competitive new products and services, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes to or lack of compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities. Any change to, or addition of, applicable regulations or federal or state legislation could have a substantial impact on our financial condition and results of operations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on the ability to pay dividends and the requirement to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including branching and acquisitions.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017, reduced the federal tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21%. While this legislation resulted in a one-time charge to earnings associated with the revaluation of Bancorp\u2019s DTAs at the date of enactment, it has since had a positive impact on earnings as federal income tax expense has been reduced. With the Biden Administration taking office in 2021, it is increasingly likely that the federal tax rate for corporations could be increased in 2021 or 2022. The potential enactment of such legislation, or changes in the interpretation of existing tax law, including provisions impacting tax rates, apportionment, consolidation or combination, income, expense, credits and exemptions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to state tax laws and regulations that go into effect in 2021 may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In March 2019, the Kentucky Legislature passed HB354 requiring financial institutions to transition from a capital based franchise tax to the Kentucky corporate income tax beginning in 2021. The Kentucky corporate income tax will be assessed at 5% of Kentucky taxable income and will be included as a component of current and deferred state income tax expense.\nWe are subject to litigation risk and reputational risk pertaining to fiduciary responsibility.\nFrom time to time, customers may make claims and take legal action pertaining to our fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to our fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services, as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 79013, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SYBT"}
