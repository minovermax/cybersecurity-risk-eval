{"cik": "14177", "company": "BRIDGFORD FOODS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-01-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other matters set forth in this Report, the continuing operations and the price of our common stock are subject to the following risks, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The risks described below are only the risks that we currently believe are material to our business. However, additional risks not presently known, or risks that are currently believed to be immaterial, may also impair our business operations.\nWe are subject to general risks in the food industry, including, among other things, risk relating to changes in consumer preferences and product contamination as well as general economic conditions, any of which risks, if realized, could negatively impact our operating results and financial position.\nThe food industry, and the markets within the food industry in which we compete, are subject to various risks, including the following: evolving consumer preferences, nutritional and health-related concerns, federal, state and local food inspection and processing controls, consumer product liability claims, risks of product tampering, and the availability and expense of liability insurance. The meat and poultry industries are subject to scrutiny due to the association of meat and poultry products with recent outbreaks of illness, and on rare occasions even death, caused by food borne pathogens. Product recalls are sometimes required in the food industry to withdraw contaminated or mislabeled products from the market. Additionally, the failure to identify and react appropriately to changes in consumer trends, demands and preferences could lead to, among other things, reduced demand and price reduction for our products. Further, we may be adversely affected by changes in domestic or foreign economic conditions, including inflation or deflation, interest rates, availability of capital markets, consumer spending rates, and energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges). These and other general risks related to the food industry, if realized by us, could have a significant adverse effect on demand for our products, as well as the costs and availability of raw materials, ingredients and packaging materials, thereby negatively affecting our operating results and financial position.\nFluctuations in the prices that we pay for raw materials could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe purchase large quantities of commodity pork, beef and flour. Historically, market prices for products we process have fluctuated in response to a number of factors, including changes in the United States government farm support programs, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, weather, and other conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons. Our operating results are heavily dependent upon the prices paid for raw materials. The marketing of our value-added products does not lend itself to instantaneous changes in selling prices. Changes in selling prices are relatively infrequent and do not compare with the volatility of commodity markets. While fluctuations in significant cost structure components, such as ingredient commodities and fuel prices, have had a significant impact on profitability over the last three years, the impact of general price inflation on our financial position and results of operations has not been significant. Future volatility of general price inflation or deflation and raw material cost and availability could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulations and a failure to comply with such regulations could negatively impact our financial results.\nOur operations are subject to extensive inspection and regulation by the USDA, FDA and by other federal, state, and local authorities regarding the processing, packaging, storage, transportation, distribution, and labeling of products that are manufactured, produced and processed by us. Our processing facilities and products are subject to continuous inspection by the USDA and/or other federal, state, and local authorities. The USDA has issued strict regulations concerning the control of listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat meat and poultry products and contamination by food borne pathogens such as E. coli and salmonella and implemented a system of regulation known as the HACCP program. The HACCP program requires all meat and poultry processing plants to develop and implement sanitary operating procedures and other program requirements. OSHA oversees safety compliance and establishes certain employer responsibilities to help \u201cassure safe and healthful working conditions\u201d and keep the workplace free of recognized hazards or practices likely to cause death or serious injury. We believe that we are currently in compliance with governmental laws and regulations and that we maintain necessary permits and licenses relating to our operations.\nA failure to obtain or a loss of necessary permits and licenses could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand and could adversely affect our operating performance. Furthermore, we are routinely subject to new or modified laws, regulations and accounting standards. If found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas, we could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls, or asset seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe depend on our key management, the loss of which could negatively impact our operations.\nOur executive officers and certain other key employees have been primarily responsible for the development and expansion of our business, and the loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could adversely affect us. Our success will be dependent in part upon our continued ability to recruit, motivate, and retain qualified personnel. We cannot assure that we will be successful in this regard. We have no employment or non-competition agreements with key personnel except for a consulting agreement with Allan L. Bridgford that is effective after his retirement from employment with our company.\nWe depend on our major customers and any loss of such customers could have a negative impact on our profitability.\nWe could suffer significant reductions in revenues and operating income if we lost one or more of our largest customers, including Wal-Mart\u00ae and Dollar General\u00ae, which accounted for 36.9% and 13.6%, respectively, of sales in fiscal year 2020. Many of our customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and food distributors have consolidated in recent years. Such consolidation has produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories while demanding lower pricing and increased promotional programs. These customers also may use their shelf space for their own private label products. Failure to respond to these trends could reduce our volume and cause us to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our product lines which could adversely affect our profitability.\nWith more than 80% of our stock beneficially owned by the Bridgford family, there are risks that they can exert significant influence or control over our corporate matters.\nMembers of the Bridgford family beneficially own, in the aggregate, more than 80% of our outstanding stock. In addition, two members of the Bridgford family currently serve on the Board of Directors. As a result, members of the Bridgford family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by our shareholders, including amendments to by-laws, election and removal of directors, any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control otherwise favored by our other shareholders and could depress our stock price. Additionally, as a result of the Bridgford family\u2019s significant ownership of the outstanding voting stock, we have relied on the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption from certain corporate governance requirements of the NASDAQ stock market. Therefore, among other things, we have elected not to implement the rule that provides for a nominating committee to identify and recommend nominees to the Board of Directors and have instead elected to have the full Board of Directors perform such function. Additionally, pursuant to this exemption, our compensation committee, which is made up of independent directors, does not have sole authority to determine the compensation of our executive officers, including our Chairman of the Board.\nWe participate in Multiemployer Pension Plans which could negatively impact our operations and profitability.\nWe participate in \u201cmultiemployer\u201d pension plans administered by labor unions on behalf of their employees. We make monthly contributions for healthcare and pension benefit obligations. The contribution amount may change depending upon the ability of participating companies to fund these pension liabilities as well as the actual and expected returns on pension plan assets. Should we withdraw from the union and cease participation in a union plan, federal law could impose a penalty for additional contributions to the plan. The penalty would be recorded as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The ultimate amount of the withdrawal liability is dependent upon several factors including the funded status of the plan and contributions made by other participating companies. We continue to participate in other multiemployer union plans. In the event of a full or partial withdrawal from these plans, the impact to our financial statements could be material.\nEminent domain and land risk regulations could negatively impact our financial results and financial position.\nWe own real property on which we operate our processing and/or our distribution operations. As is the case with any owner of real property, we may be subject to eminent domain proceedings that can impact the value of investments we have made in real property as well as potentially disrupt our business operations. If subject to eminent domain proceedings or other government takings, we may not be adequately compensated.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our operations and financial condition.\nWe have considered the impact of federal, state and local government actions related to the global novel coronavirus pandemic (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d or \u201cpandemic\u201d) on our condensed consolidated financial statements. The business disruptions associated with the pandemic had a significant negative impact on our consolidated condensed financial statements for the fiscal year ended October 30, 2020. We expect these events to have future business impacts, the extent of which is uncertain and largely subject to whether the severity worsens, or the duration of current business shutdowns continue. These impacts could include but may not be limited to risks and uncertainty related to shifts in demand between sales channels, market volatility, constraints in our supply chain, our ability to operate production facilities and worker availability. These unknowns may subject the Company to future risks related to long-lived asset impairments, increased reserves for uncollectible accounts, price and availability of ingredients and raw materials used in our products and adjustments to reflect the market value of our inventory.", "PERMNO": 19271, "SIC": 2013, "TIC": "BRID"}
