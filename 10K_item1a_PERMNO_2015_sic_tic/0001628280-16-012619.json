{"cik": "885322", "company": "ANCHOR BANCORP WISCONSIN INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other documents we file with the SEC are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. Our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. The value of shares of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks. This report, including the documents incorporated by reference herein, also contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks described below.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may not be able to fully execute on our business initiatives, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are primarily a community-oriented commercially focused retail bank offering traditional deposit products and have historically focused on retail banking and residential mortgage lending. We have been developing strategies to grow other loan categories to diversify earning assets and to increase low cost core deposits, including transforming our business to a relationship-focused commercial bank, expanding our commercial banking services and other business strategies. These strategies include, over time, expanding our business banking operations. Our business banking initiative includes focusing on small and mid-sized businesses, with an emphasis on attracting clients from competitors. There are costs, risks and uncertainties associated with the development, implementation and execution of these initiatives, including the investment of time and resources, the possibility that these initiatives will be unprofitable and the risk of additional liabilities associated with these initiatives. In addition, our ability to successfully execute on these new initiatives will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain talented individuals to help manage these initiatives and the existence of satisfactory market conditions that will allow us to profitably grow. Our potential inability to successfully execute these initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nWhile we recently reversed substantially all of the valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset, we may not be able to realize the asset in the future and the deferred tax asset may be subject to additional valuation allowances.\nDuring September 2009, the Company established a full deferred tax asset valuation allowance covering its federal and state tax loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets. As a result of management\u2019s ongoing periodic assessments of the deferred tax asset position, the Company determined that it was appropriate to substantially reverse this deferred tax asset valuation allowance. In 2015, the Company determined that it is more likely than not it will be able to realize its deferred tax asset, including its entire federal tax loss carryforwards and a significant portion of its state tax loss carryforwards, with the exception of $4.2 million pertaining to certain multi state loss carryforwards, including states in which the Company no longer does business. This action resulted in the recognition of a $108.9 million income tax benefit, net of current tax provision.\nThe ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods that the related net operating losses and certain recognized built-in losses and net unrealized built-in losses, if any (collectively, \u201cpre-change losses\u201d), may be utilized and is also subject to the rules of Section 382 of the Code, described below. If our estimates and assumptions about future taxable income or our assessment of the positive and negative evidence are not accurate, the value of our deferred tax asset may not be recoverable and our cash flow available to fund operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets may be materially impaired.\nOur ability to use our deferred tax assets to offset future taxable income will be limited if we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the\u201d Code\u201d). Due to the complexity of Section 382, it is difficult to conclude with certainty at any given point in time whether an ownership change has occurred. A Company that experiences an ownership change will generally be subject to an annual limitation on the use of its pre-change losses equal to the equity value of the Company immediately before the ownership change (in some cases, reduced by certain capital contributions received in the two years preceding the ownership change), multiplied by the applicable \u201clong-term tax-exempt rate\u201d (a rate that changes monthly and was 2.61% for ownership changes occurring in December 2015). While the Tax Attribute Preservation Provision has been included in our Amended Charter to prohibit and void ab initio future transactions in our common stock that would result in an ownership change, such an ownership change nevertheless could occur in the future, which likely would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, consolidated financial condition and stockholder value. Any change in applicable law may result in an ownership change. Further, this provision may limit our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock.\nOld National and the Company jointly announced the execution of a definitive agreement under which Old National will acquire the Company through a stock and cash merger. The definitive merger agreement has been unanimously approved by the Board of both Old National and the Company. The transaction remains subject to regulatory approval and the vote of the Company's stockholders. The transaction is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2016 and upon consummation, it is anticipated that the Company will experience an ownership change under Section 382.\nWe depend on our key officers and employees to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services. Management\u2019s ability to retain key officers and employees may change.\nWe believe that the implementation of our long-term business strategy and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our current senior management team. We believe our senior management team possesses valuable knowledge about and experience in the banking industry and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replace. Although most of our senior management team has entered into employment agreements with us, they may not complete the term of their employment agreements or renew them upon expiration. Our success also depends on the experience of our branch managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve.\nOur future operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, financial, technical, marketing, sales and support personnel, particularly in respect of the implementation of our business strategy, which may require the recruitment of new personnel in new or expanded business areas. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and it may be increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time. The loss of service of one or more of our key officers and employees, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or operating results.\nOur allowance for losses on loans may not be adequate to cover probable losses.\nThe allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense. Loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when we believe that repayment of principal is unlikely. Our level of non-performing loans decreased significantly in the year ended December 31, 2015, relative to the prior year period.\nHowever, any material declines in the creditworthiness of our customers, real estate market conditions and values, general economic conditions or changes in regulatory policies would likely result in a higher probability that principal on some loans will not be repaid and require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. A material increase in the allowance for loan losses would adversely affect our results of operations and our capital.\nThe Bank\u2019s business is subject to liquidity risk and changes in its source of funds may adversely affect our performance and consolidated financial condition by increasing its cost of funds.\nThe Bank\u2019s ability to make loans and fund expenses is directly related to its ability to secure funding. Retail and commercial core deposits are the Bank\u2019s primary source of liquidity. The Bank also relies on cash from payments received from loans and investments, as well as advances from the FHLB of Chicago as a funding source.\nPrimary uses of funds include withdrawal of and interest payments on deposits, originations of loans and payment of operating expenses. Core deposits represent a significant source of low-cost funds. Alternative funding sources such as large balance time deposits or borrowings are a comparatively higher-cost source of funds. Liquidity risk arises from the inability to meet obligations when they come due or to manage unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources. Significant fluctuations in lower cost funding vehicles would cause the Bank to pursue higher-cost funding which would adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s liquidity is dependent upon our ability to receive dividends from the Bank, which accounts for substantially all our revenue which could affect our ability to pay dividends, and we may be unable to generate liquidity from other sources.\nWe are a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries, including the Bank. We receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from the Bank, which we use as the principal source of funds to pay our expenses. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank and certain of our non-bank subsidiaries may pay us. Such limits are also tied to the earnings of our subsidiaries. If the Bank does not receive regulatory approval or if our subsidiaries\u2019 earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels, our ability to pay our expenses, our business, our consolidated financial condition or our results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Bank declared and paid a dividend to us.\nIncreases in our level of non-performing assets would have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nIf loans that are currently performing become non-performing, we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses if additional losses are anticipated which would have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. The increased time and expense associated with the work out of non-performing assets and potential non-performing assets also could adversely affect our operations.\nIf our investment in the capital stock of the FHLB of Chicago is other than temporarily impaired, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations could be impaired.\nThe Bank owns capital stock of the FHLB of Chicago. The capital stock is held to qualify for membership in the FHLB System and to be eligible to borrow funds under the FHLB of Chicago\u2019s advance program. There is no market for the FHLB of Chicago capital stock and, while redemptions may be requested, they are at the discretion of the FHLB of Chicago.\nThe Bank evaluates the FHLB of Chicago stock for impairment on a regular basis. The determination of whether FHLB of Chicago stock is impaired depends on a number of factors and is based on an assessment of the ultimate recoverability of cost rather than changes in the book value of the shares. If our investment in the capital stock of the FHLB of Chicago were to become other than temporarily impaired, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations could be affected.\nMaintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services.\nOur success depends, in part, on the ability to adapt products and services to evolving industry and regulatory standards. There is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices. This can reduce net interest income and non-interest income from fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to modify or adapt existing products and services or develop new products and services. We may not be successful in introducing new products and services in response to industry trends or development in technology or those new products may not achieve market acceptance. As a result, we could lose business, be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients, or be subject to cost increases.\nDeterioration in the real estate markets and economic conditions could lead to additional losses, which could have a material negative effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on general and local economic conditions and the real estate and business markets in which we compete. Any future declines in real estate values may reduce the value of collateral securing loans and impact the customer\u2019s ability to\nborrow or repay. Increases in delinquency levels or declines in real estate values could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nWhile we attempt to manage the risk from changes in market interest rates, interest rate risk management techniques are not exact. In addition, we may not be able to economically hedge our interest rate risk. A rapid or substantial increase or decrease in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest income and results of operations.\nOur earnings and cash flows depend to a great extent upon the level of our net interest income. The amount of interest income is dependent on many factors, including the volume of earning assets, the general level of interest rates, the dynamics of changes in interest rates and the level of non-performing loans. The cost of funds varies with the amount of funds required to support earning assets, the rates paid to attract and hold deposits, rates paid on borrowed funds and the levels of non-interest-bearing demand deposits and equity capital.\nDifferent types of assets and liabilities are impacted differently, and at different times, by changes in market interest rates. We are unable to predict changes in market interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond our control including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, domestic and international events, changes in the United States and other financial markets and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, particularly the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Net interest income is not only affected by the level and direction of interest rates, but also by the shape of the yield curve, credit spreads, relationships between interest sensitive instruments and key driver rates, balance sheet growth, client loan and deposit preferences and the timing of changes in these variables. Additionally, an increase in interest rates may, among other things, reduce the demand for loans and our ability to originate loans and decrease loan repayment rates. A decrease in the general level of interest rates may affect us through, among other things, increased prepayments on our loan and mortgage backed securities portfolios and increased competition for deposits. Accordingly, changes in the level of market interest rates affect our net yield on interest earning assets, loan origination volume, loan and mortgage backed securities portfolios, and our overall results.\nWe attempt to manage our risk from changes in market interest rates through asset/liability management by adjusting the rates, maturity, repricing, and balances of the different types of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate risk management techniques, however, are not precise, and we may not be able to successfully manage our interest rate risk. As a result, a rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our net interest margin and results of operations.\nSince we engage in lending secured by real estate and may be forced to foreclose on the collateral property and own the underlying real estate, we may be subject to the increased costs and risks associated with the ownership of real property, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans, in which case, we are exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate. The amount that we, as a mortgagee, may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral or local economic conditions;\n\u2022\nenvironmental cleanup liabilities;\n\u2022\nneighborhood values;\n\u2022\nreal estate tax rates;\n\u2022\noperating expenses of the mortgaged properties;\n\u2022\nsupply of and demand for rental units or properties;\n\u2022\nability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties;\n\u2022\nzoning laws;\n\u2022\ngovernmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies; and\n\u2022\nextreme weather conditions or other natural or man-made disasters.\nCertain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, principally maintenance costs, may also adversely affect our operating expenses.\nAn interruption in or breach in security of our information systems may result in a loss of customer business.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruptions or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, servicing or loan origination systems. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of information systems used to process customer transactions could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to\nadditional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we outsource portions of our data processing to third parties. If our third party provider encounters difficulties or if we have difficulty in communicating with such third party, it will significantly affect our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions, which would significantly affect our business operations. Furthermore, breaches of such third party\u2019s technology may also cause reimbursable loss to our consumer and business customers, through no fault of our own.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and consolidated financial condition.\nOur regional concentration makes us particularly at risk for changes in economic conditions in our primary market.\nOur business is primarily located in Wisconsin. Due to our lack of geographic diversification, we are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in Wisconsin and the Midwest more generally. The economic conditions in Wisconsin and the Midwest affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and future prospects, where adverse economic developments, among other things, could affect the volume of loan originations, increase the level of non-performing assets, increase the rate of foreclosure losses on loans and reduce the value of our loans and loan servicing portfolio. Any regional or local economic downturn that affects existing or prospective borrowers or property values in such areas may affect us and our profitability more significantly and more adversely than our competitors whose operations are less geographically concentrated.\nOur asset valuations include observable inputs and may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to asset valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or consolidated financial condition.\nWe use estimates, assumptions and judgments when financial assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices and/or other observable inputs provided by independent third-party sources, when available. When such third-party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flows and other financial modeling techniques utilizing assumptions such as credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relevant inputs. Changes in underlying inputs, factors, assumptions or estimates in any of the areas underlying our estimates could materially impact our future consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud or certain borrower defaults, which could harm our liquidity, results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nWhen we sell mortgage loans we are required to make customary representations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. While we sell mortgage loans with no recourse, our whole loan sale agreements require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans in the event we breach any of these representations or warranties. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of borrower fraud. If the level of repurchase and indemnity activity becomes material, our liquidity, results of operations and consolidated financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nCertain provisions in our Amended Charter limit our likelihood of being acquired in a manner not approved by the Board.\nThe Plan of Reorganization the Amended Charter contain provisions to protect certain tax attributes of the Company and its subsidiaries following emergence from bankruptcy. Until the third anniversary of the Effective Date, unless approved by the Board in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Amended Charter and subject to certain exceptions for permitted transfers, any attempted transfer of the Company\u2019s common stock is prohibited and void ab initio to the extent that, as a result of such transfer (or any series of transfers of which such transfer is a part), either (i) any person or group of persons will own 4.95% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock or preferred stock of the Company or (ii) the ownership interest in the Company of any of its existing 5% stockholders will be increased. The Expiration Date may be extended in the Board\u2019s discretion until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date in order to protect the tax attributes of the Company.\nThe existence of the Tax Attribute Preservation Provision may make it more difficult, delay, discourage, prevent or make it more costly to acquire us or affect a change in control that is not approved by the Board. This, in turn, could prevent our\nstockholders from recognizing a gain in the event that a favorable offer is extended and could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOld National and the Company jointly announced the execution of a definitive agreement under which Old National will acquire the Company through a stock and cash merger. The definitive merger agreement has been unanimously approved by the Board of both Old National and the Company. The transaction remains subject to regulatory approval and the vote of the Company's stockholders. The transaction is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2016.\nWe offer third-party products, including mutual funds, annuities, life insurance, individual securities and other wealth management services which could experience significant declines in value subjecting us to reputational damage and litigation risk.\nWe offer third-party products, including mutual funds, annuities, life insurance, individual securities and other wealth management products and services. If these products do not generate competitive risk-adjusted returns that satisfy clients in a variety of asset classes, we will have difficulty maintaining existing business and attracting new business. Additionally, our investment services business involves the risk that clients or others may sue us, claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty owed to them. Our investment services businesses are particularly subject to this risk and this risk may be heightened during periods when credit, equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile, or when clients or investors are experiencing losses. Significant declines in the performance of these third-party products could subject us to reputational damage and litigation risk.\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we own or take title.\nIn the course of our business we may own or foreclose and take title to real estate that could be subject to environmental liabilities. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, consolidated financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of our Common Stock\nAn active, liquid and orderly trading market for our common stock may not develop and the stock price may be volatile.\nSince our common stock is not widely traded, its market value could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various risk factors including:\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our industry, products or services;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;\n\u2022\nvolatility in the market value and trading volume of companies in our industry or companies that investors consider comparable;\n\u2022\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe expiration of contractual lock-up agreements;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both;\n\u2022\nthe impact of changes in the economic environment;\n\u2022\nthe impact of changes in the political environment;\n\u2022\nactivities by our competitors;\n\u2022\nloss of significant customers;\n\u2022\nmajor catastrophic events; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions and trends.\nAs a result of the Plan of Reorganization, a limited number of stockholders are substantial holders of the shares of our common stock.\nAs a result of the Private Placements pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, as of September 30, 2013, certain investors own up to 9.9% of our common stock and certain other investors own up to 4.9% of our common stock. Having a large portion of our shares of common stock held by a relatively small number of stockholders could result in a material impact on the trading\nvolume and price per share of our common stock if any of these stockholders decide to sell a significant portion of their holdings. As a result, a small number of holders of our common stock are able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval.\nThe Investor SPAs and the Secondary SPAs grant the Investors and the Secondary Investors, respectively, certain preemptive rights and approval rights which could impede our ability to raise additional equity capital. Under the Investor SPAs and the Secondary SPAs, in certain instances, the Investors and the Secondary Investors, respectively, have preemptive rights to purchase equity securities we may offer in non-SEC registered capital raising transactions. These rights may adversely affect our ability to raise additional equity capital on favorable terms. If management determines we need to raise additional equity capital for our business, our inability to do so on favorable terms may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations and, as a result, a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations.\n\u201cAnti-takeover\u201d provisions and the regulations to which we are subject may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions in Delaware law and our Amended Charter and bylaws (the \u201cAmended Bylaws\u201d), as well as regulatory approvals that would be required under federal law, could make it more difficult for a third party to take control of us and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock. These provisions could adversely affect the market value of our common stock and could reduce the amount that stockholders might get if we are sold.\nOur Amended Charter provides for, among other things:\n\u2022\nadvance notice for nomination of directors and other stockholder proposals;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe approval by a super-majority of outstanding shares to amend certain provisions of the Amended Bylaws and the certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022\nthe Tax Attribute Preservation Provision.\nDelaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. We believe that these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board and by providing our Board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be determined to be beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board determines is not in the best interest of our stockholders.\nFurthermore, banking laws impose notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any stockholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect \u201ccontrol\u201d of an FDIC-insured depository institution. These laws include the Federal Savings and Loan Holding Company Act, the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and the Change in Bank Control Act. These laws could delay or prevent an acquisition.\nOld National and the Company jointly announced the execution of a definitive agreement under which Old National will acquire the Company through a stock and cash merger. The definitive merger agreement has been unanimously approved by the Board of both Old National and the Company. The transaction remains subject to regulatory approval and the vote of the Company's stockholders. The transaction is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2016.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur business may be adversely affected by the pace of economic activity and recovery, current conditions in the financial markets, the real estate market and economic conditions generally.\nThe pace of this economic recovery has resulted in lower levels of lending by some financial institutions to their customers in contrast to lending experienced in other periods of economic recovery. This has continued to result in a lack of customer confidence, increased market volatility and a widespread lower level of general business activity. Competition among financial institutions for deposits and loans continues to be high, and access to deposits or borrowed funds remains lower than average.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could materially and adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Transactions with other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk is likely to be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due us. Any losses\nresulting from such defaults by us, our counterparties or our clients could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nCompetition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or reducing margins.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. We face aggressive competition from other domestic and foreign lending institutions and from numerous other providers of financial services. The ability of non-banking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition. Because non-banking financial institutions are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies, they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures.\nSecurities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions. This may significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business. As a result of these various sources of competition, we could lose business to competitors or be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients, either of which would adversely affect our profitability.\nWe continually encounter technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Recent Market, Legislative and Regulatory Events\nWe are highly dependent upon programs administered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. Changes in existing U.S. government-sponsored mortgage programs or servicing eligibility standards could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur ability to generate revenues through mortgage loan sales to institutional buyers depends to a significant degree on programs administered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and others that facilitate the issuance of mortgage backed securities in the secondary market. Our status as a Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac approved seller/servicer is subject to compliance with each entity\u2019s respective selling and servicing guides.\nWe also derive other material financial benefits from our relationships with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including the assumption of credit risk by these entities on loans included in mortgage backed securities in exchange for our payment of guarantee fees and the ability to avoid certain loan inventory finance costs through streamlined loan funding and sale procedures. Any discontinuation of, or significant reduction or material change in, the operation of these entities or any significant adverse change in the level of activity in the secondary mortgage market or the underwriting criteria of these entities would likely prevent us from originating and selling most, if not all, of our mortgage loan originations.\nIn addition, we service loans on behalf of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as loans that have been securitized pursuant to securitization programs sponsored by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in connection with the issuance of agency guaranteed mortgage backed securities and a majority of our mortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSR\u201d) relate to these servicing activities.\nPotential changes to the government-sponsored mortgage programs, and related servicing compensation structures, could require us to fundamentally change our business model in order to effectively compete in the market. Our inability to make the necessary changes to respond to these changing market conditions or loss of our approved seller/servicer status with any of these entities, would have a material adverse effect on our overall business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and accounting principles, or changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us.\nAs a SLHC and a federal savings association, we and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and legal requirements that govern almost all aspects of our operations. These laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on the business activities in which we can engage, limit the dividends or\ndistributions that the Bank can pay to us, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee our debt and impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than generally accepted accounting principles. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect us adversely, including limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or increasing the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure follows good faith effort or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base and the price of our securities. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business and consolidated financial condition.\nFederal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we are or become subject as a result of such examinations may adversely affect us.\nFederal banking agencies, including the OCC and Federal Reserve, periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a federal banking agency were to determine that the consolidated financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we or the Bank or its management were in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our or the Bank\u2019s capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against us, our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate the Bank\u2019s deposit insurance.\nRegulatory requirements may affect our ability to attract and retain management and directors.\nIf we fail to meet various regulatory requirements, such failure could potentially affect our ability to attract and retain management and directors.\nFinancial institutions, such as the Bank, face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe federal BSA, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the BSA, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements, and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and IRS. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the sanctions programs and rules administered and enforced by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control. In order to comply with regulations, guidelines and examination procedures in this area, we have dedicated significant resources to the development of our anti-money laundering program, adopting enhanced policies and procedures and implementing a robust automated anti-money laundering software solution. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we could be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plans.\nWe are subject to the CRA and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity and restrictions on expansion activity. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation.\nThe FDIC\u2019s restoration plan and the related increased assessment rate could adversely affect our earnings.\nMarket developments have significantly depleted the DIF of the FDIC and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits. As a result of recent economic conditions and the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has increased the deposit insurance assessment rates and thus raised deposit premiums for insured depository institutions. If these increases are insufficient for the DIF to meet its funding requirements, further special assessments or increases in deposit insurance premiums may be required. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums. Any future additional assessments, increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums may materially adversely affect results of operations.\nWe may be subject to more stringent capital requirements.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies to establish stricter risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits to apply to banks and bank and savings and loan holding companies. In July 2013, the federal banking agencies published the Basel III Capital Rules that revised their risk-based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk-weighted assets to implement, in part, agreements reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Capital Rules apply to banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank.\nThe Company and the Bank became subject to regulatory capital requirements under Basel III Capital Rules effective January 1, 2015, with a phase in period that generally extends from January 1, 2015 through January 1, 2019. Since the effective date of Basel III neither the Company nor the Bank has experienced any material impact involving the new rules. Subsequent potential rules adjustment by the regulatory governing bodies could still impact the Company or the Bank when they become effective.\nThe fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nThe Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect the net interest margin. The resulting changes in interest rates can also materially decrease the value of certain financial assets we hold, such as debt securities. Its policies can also adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in Federal Reserve policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict.\nRisks Relating to the Old National Merger\nWe will be subject to contractual restrictions and business uncertainties while the Old National merger is pending.\nOur merger agreement with Old National restricts us from operating our business other than in the ordinary course and prohibits us from taking specified actions without Old National\u2019s consent until the merger occurs. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger. In addition, uncertainty about the effect of the Old National merger on our employees and clients may have an adverse effect on our business. We may have difficulty retaining employees while the merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with Old National. In addition, the uncertainty caused by the pending merger could cause our clients and business associates to seek to change their existing business relationships with us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel and retain and grow our client base until we complete the merger.\nThe merger is subject to certain closing conditions that, if not satisfied or waived, will result in the merger not being completed. Failure to complete the merger with Old National could negatively affect our business.\nThe merger is subject to customary conditions to closing, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals and adoption of the merger by the Company's stockholders. If any condition to the merger is not satisfied or waived, to the extent permitted by law, including the absence of any materially burdensome condition in the regulatory approvals, the merger will not be completed. In addition, either Old National or the Company may terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances even if the merger is adopted by the Company's stockholders, including but not limited to, if the merger has not been completed on or before October 11, 2016, provided that Old National may extend the date to January 11, 2017, if on October 11, 2016, all closing conditions except obtaining the required regulatory approvals have been satisfied or waived and Old National in good faith believes such regulatory approvals will be received by January 11, 2017. If we do not complete the merger, we would not\nrealize any of the expected benefits of having completed the merger. If the merger is not completed, additional risks could materialize, which could materially and adversely affect the business, financial results and consolidated financial condition.\nIf the merger is not completed, we will have incurred material expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger.\nWe will have incurred material expenses in connection with the negotiation and signing of the merger agreement, the receipt of regulatory and stockholder approvals and in anticipation of the completion of the merger. If the merger is not completed, we will have to recognize these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger.\nThe merger is subject to the receipt of consents and approvals from governmental entities that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the merger.\nBefore the merger may be completed, various approvals or consents must be obtained from regulatory authorities. These regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC, may impose conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger. Such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger, giving Old National the right to terminate the merger agreement or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger, any of which might have an adverse effect on the combined company following the merger. On February 12, 2016, the Federal Reserve Board granted Old National's request for a waiver of the Federal Reserve Board's application requirements. There can be no assurance as to whether all the regulatory approvals will be received, the timing of such approvals, or whether any conditions will be imposed.\nWe cannot be sure of the market value of the merger consideration that our stockholders will receive as a result of the announced merger with Old National.\nIf the merger is completed, each share of the Company's common stock will be converted into the right to receive, at the holder\u2019s election and subject to the proration as set forth in the merger agreement, 3.5505 shares of Old National common stock or $48.50 in cash; however the exchange ratio for shares of stock is subject to adjustment if (i) the after-tax environmental costs in relation to our properties are in excess of $5,000,000 or (ii) at any time during the five-day period starting on the date on which all regulatory approvals required for the completion of the merger are received, the average closing price of a share of Old National common stock for the ten consecutive trading days prior to the first date on which all required regulatory approvals are received is less than $10.67 per share and decreases by more than 20% in relation to the change in the NASDAQ Bank Index.\nAdditionally, the market value of the merger consideration may vary from the closing price of Old National common stock on the date we announced the merger, on the date that the proxy statement/prospectus is mailed to our stockholders, on the date of the special meeting of our stockholders, on the date we complete the merger and thereafter. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in our respective businesses, operations and prospects, and the regulatory situation of Old National and the Company. Many of these factors are beyond our control. Any change in the market price of Old National common stock prior to completion of the merger will affect the amount of and the market value of the merger consideration that our stockholders will receive upon completion of the merger. Accordingly, at the time of the special meeting, our stockholders will not know or be able to calculate the amount or the market value of the merger consideration they would receive upon completion of the merger.\nFurther, the businesses of Old National and the Company differ in important respects and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of the combined company\u2019s shares of common stock may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of Old National and the Company.\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nThe success of the merger will depend, in part, on Old National\u2019s ability to realize anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses of Old National and the Company and to combine the businesses of Old National and the Company in a manner that permits growth opportunities and cost savings to be realized without materially disrupting the existing customer relationships of the Company or decreasing revenues due to loss of customers. However, to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings, Old National must successfully combine the businesses of Old National and the Company. If the combined company is not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nThe Company has operated and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees who may then receive severance benefits, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the\ncombined company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. The anticipated cost savings from the merger are largely expected to derive from the absorption by Old National of many of our back-office and other duplicative administrative functions. Integration efforts between the two companies will also divert significant management attention and resources that will not be available for normal operations. An inability to successfully market Old National\u2019s products to the Company's customer base could cause the earnings of the combined company to be less than anticipated. An expected benefit from the merger is an expected increase in the revenues of the combined company from anticipated sales of Old National\u2019s wide variety of financial products, and from increased lending out of the combined company\u2019s larger capital base and legal lending limits. An inability to successfully market Old National\u2019s products to our customer base could cause the earnings of the combined company to be less than anticipated. Integration matters and the transition to Old National could have an adverse effect on the Company and Old National during the pre-merger transition period, and on Old National for an undetermined period after consummation of the merger.\nThe merger agreement limits our ability to pursue an alternative acquisition proposal and could require us to pay a termination fee of $15.0 million under certain circumstances relating to alternative acquisition proposals.\nThe merger agreement prohibits the Company from soliciting, initiating or knowingly encouraging certain alternative acquisition proposals with any third party, subject to exceptions set forth in the merger agreement. The merger agreement also provides for the payment by the Company to Old National of a termination fee in the amount of $15.0 million (and, in some cases, Old National's documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the merger) in the event that the Company or Old National terminates the merger agreement for certain specified reasons. These provisions might discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of the Company from considering or proposing such an acquisition.", "PERMNO": 77783, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "ABCW"}
