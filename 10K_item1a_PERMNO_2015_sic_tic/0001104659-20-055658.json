RISK FACTORS\nIf any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operation, cash flow and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nOur business is subject to risks arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe recent outbreak of COVID-19, which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a pandemic, has spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A pandemic, including COVID-19, or other public health epidemic poses the risk that we or our employees, vendors, suppliers and other partners may be prevented from conducting normal business activities at full capacity for an indefinite period of time, including due to spread of disease among our employees, vendors, suppliers and other partners, or due to shutdowns that may be or have been requested or mandated by governmental authorities. While it is not possible at this time to predict with certainty the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, the continued spread of COVID-19 and the measures taken by the U.S. government and the government of the countries in which we operate and in which our vendors and suppliers operate has and / or may continue to result in, among other things, the closure of all of our boutiques from March 25, 2020 to April 30, 2020, when we began reopening a small number of our boutiques in locations where local shutdown orders have been lifted, reduced operating capacity at our ecommerce website and distribution facility, reduced customer visits on our ecommerce website, temporary furloughs of substantially all corporate and boutique employees (for the duration of boutique closures at their location and subject to reduced staffing for a phase-in period upon reopening), base salary reductions for our senior leadership team, suspension of payment of all accounts payable other than those necessary to support our ecommerce business, a shortage of boutique employees who are willing to operate our boutiques when they reopen, a delay in the shipment of merchandise to our boutiques or a shortage of merchandise in our boutiques and a decrease in consumer willingness to visit malls and shopping centers and consumer discretionary spending generally. If individuals decide to continue to stay at home and away from malls and other shopping locations when our boutiques reopen, including due to continued and prolonged periods of government mandated remote work or sheltering in place or due to a resurgence of COVID-19 after the initial infection has subsided, it would further adversely affect traffic in our boutiques and, therefore, our operating results and financial condition will or may be adversely impacted. In addition, if individuals are concerned with the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, they may decrease their discretionary spending on our products, which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures are currently having and may continue to have an adverse impact on global economic conditions, which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition, including on our ability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain its impact.\nIn addition, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, many federal, state and local governmental authorities or individual landlords have granted, or may potentially grant, rent relief or other relief or enact amnesty programs applicable to the leases for our boutiques, corporate headquarters and distribution facility. As a result of such relief, beginning in April 2020, we stopped lease payments on all of our boutiques, corporate headquarters and distribution facility, subject to discussions with our landlords. We intend to resume lease payments, including the repayment of abated lease payments, upon the earlier of the termination of such rental relief periods or upon our resuming normal operations following the COVID-19 pandemic. If we are unable to generate sufficient operating income to repay abated lease payments within the timelines prescribed by applicable governmental authorities or agreed by our landlords, the leases for our boutiques, corporate headquarters and distribution facility may be subject to cancellation. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining all or any of the additional rent relief we are seeking. Failure to obtain such rent abatements would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will depend on our ability to have sufficient liquidity until such time as our stores can again generate revenue and profits capable of supporting our ongoing operations, all of which remain highly uncertain at this time.\nOur audited financial statements included a statement that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and a continuation of negative financial trends could result in our inability to continue as a going concern.\nOur audited financial statements as of and for the year ended February 1, 2020 were prepared on the assumption that we would continue as a going concern. Our audited financial statements as of and for the year ended February 1, 2020 did not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations as described above, our management has determined that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months and our independent auditors have included a \u201cgoing concern\u201d explanatory paragraph in their report on our financial statements as of and for the year ended February 1, 2020. We have obtained a waiver of any event of default associated with our independent auditor\u2019s report indicating a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in connection with our year-end audit under our Amended Asset Based Revolving Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\u201cAmended ABL Credit Agreement\u201d) and Term Loan Credit Agreement with Tiger Finance, LLC (\u201cTerm Loan Credit Agreement\u201d). The reaction of investors to the inclusion of a going concern statement by our independent auditors, and our potential inability to continue as a going concern, could materially adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nAdditionally, if our projected operating results fail to improve we could violate additional debt covenants, our liquidity could be further adversely impacted and we may need to seek additional sources of funding. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our borrowing base availability under our Amended ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement, raise additional capital to fund our operations, or that debt or equity financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms. If our operating results fail to improve, then our financial condition could render us unable to continue as a going concern.\nOur liquidity has been adversely impacted by our negative operating results and the COVID-19 pandemic and there is no assurance that we will have sufficient liquidity to continue operations.\nWe experienced significant declines in comparable sales, net sales and gross profit since fiscal year 2017 as compared to prior periods. The decrease in comparable sales was primarily driven by the decline in boutique traffic and conversion rates. The shutdown of all of our boutiques in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic have exasperated these issues. As a result, we need to obtain additional financing to fund our current obligations and operations either through a refinancing or other means. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effect a refinancing on acceptable terms or obtain additional liquidity. As described above in the risk factors entitled, \u201cOur business is subject to risks arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d and \u201cAs a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our audited financial statements contain a statement regarding a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\u201d, the inclusion of a going concern qualification in the report of our independent registered public accountant on our financial statements for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2020 resulted in a violation of certain covenants under our Amended ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement. In addition, our failure to pay rent on our leased locations in the month of April has resulted, and our planned non-payment of rent in the months of May and June will result, in a violation of certain covenants under our Amended ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement. If we are unable to regain compliance (without further waivers from our lenders) with the covenants under our Amended ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement, we may have events of default under such credit agreements and we may be unable to make future borrowings under such credit agreements. Any inability to borrow under our credit agreements would adversely impact our ability to repay currently suspended accounts payable and abated lease payments for all of our boutiques, corporate headquarters and distribution facility, within the timelines prescribed by applicable governmental authorities or agreed to by our landlords or third parties, as applicable. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to secure sufficient liquidity to fund our business operations, including through additional financings, re-financings, or that we will be able achieve positive results through our growth strategy. If we are unable to generate or obtain the requisite amount of financing needed to fund our business operations or execute our growth strategy, our liquidity and ability to continue operations could be materially adversely affected. As a result, we may be required to delay, reduce and/or cease our operations and/or seek bankruptcy protection.\nWe have recently experienced a significant decline in our operating margins and our inability to maintain or improve our operating margins could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn fiscal year 2018, we had an operating loss for the first time as a public company. We also had an operating loss in fiscal year 2019. We aim to increase our operating margins through enhancements to our merchandise offerings, continued cost disciplines, improved productivity in our boutiques and the optimization of the lease expense structure for our existing boutiques. There can be no assurance that these measures will be successful. Further, our operating loss has resulted in less cash from operations making it more difficult for us to successfully operate our business and execute our turnaround plan. For example, we have paused our boutique remodel program that we initiated in fiscal year 2018 even though we view this refresh program as an important investment to continually enhance the customer shopping experience we strive to achieve. Additionally, it has made it difficult for us to capitalize on our opportunities to improve our infrastructure. For example, with respect to our infrastructure, if we do not have the funds to adequately refine and improve our various ordering, tracking and allocation systems, we may not be able to react quickly enough to changing trends and customer demand or reduce inventory shrinkage. If we are not able to successfully execute our turnaround plan, we may not be able to achieve our goals with respect to operating margins. As a result, our operating margins may stagnate or further decline, which could adversely affect our ability to make necessary improvements to our business, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have recently experienced a significant decline in our comparable sales and our inability to maintain or increase our comparable sales could adversely impact our net sales and financial condition.\nOur comparable sales significantly declined since fiscal years 2017 as compared to prior year periods. We may not be able to sustain or increase comparable sales. If our future comparable sales further decline or fail to meet market expectations, our profitability could be harmed or become nonexistent. The aggregate comparable sales levels of our boutiques have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect comparable sales, including fashion trends, competition, current national and regional economic conditions, pricing, changes in customer shopping patterns, changes in our merchandise mix, prior period comparable sales levels, inventory shrinkage, the timing and amount of markdowns, the success of our marketing programs, the success of our merchandising initiatives, holiday timing and weather conditions. These factors, among others, may cause our comparable sales results to be materially lower than in recent periods, which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe value of our deferred tax assets may not be realizable to the extent our future profits are less than we have projected, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.\nWe evaluate the realizability of our deferred income tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing basis. In evaluating our deferred income tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized. Based on available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future income, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies, we determined that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize our deferred tax assets in future periods and, therefore, a full valuation allowance has been established against our net deferred tax assets since fiscal year 2018. Our assessment of the realizability of our deferred income tax assets requires significant judgment.\nThere are no assurances that we will not increase or decrease the valuation allowances in future periods against deferred tax assets and liabilities. Any additional valuation allowance or the failure to reverse our current valuation allowance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions.\nWe will require capital to fund our business, which may not be available to us on satisfactory terms or at all. We plan to use cash from operations and our Amended ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement to fund our operations and execute our strategy. If we are unable to maintain sufficient levels of cash flow, we may not meet our expectations or we may require additional financing which could adversely affect our financial health and impose covenants that limit our business activities.\nWe currently primarily depend on cash flow from operations and our Amended ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement to fund our business. Availability under the Amended ABL Credit Agreement is subject to a customary borrowing base, as reasonably determined by the applicable agent, comprised of: (a) a specified percentage of the Borrower\u2019s credit card accounts (as defined in the Amended ABL Credit Agreement); and (b) a specified percentage of the Borrower\u2019s eligible inventory (as defined in the Amended ABL Credit Agreement), and reduced by (c) certain customary reserves and adjustments (as defined in the Amended ABL Credit Agreement). The combined borrowing base is the lesser of (i) the sum of the (a) the Revolving Loan Cap (as defined in the Amended ABL Credit Agreement), which is the lesser of (x) $34.0 million and (y) the borrowing base under the Amended ABL Credit Agreement, plus, (b) any outstanding amount under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and (ii) the Term Loan Credit Agreement borrowing base (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement). In addition, on May 1, 2020, we entered the JPM Letter Agreement and Tiger Letter Agreement which contain certain conditions and covenants and to provide that in the case of the JPM Letter Agreement, (i) we are required to use the entire $10.7 million income tax refund requested under the CARES Act to repay certain outstanding borrowings under the Amended ABL Credit Agreement and (ii) no loans will be made under the ABL Credit Agreement unless our aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents is less than $3.0 million. See Item 9B of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our operations and execute on strategy, and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from our Amended ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement, we may need additional equity or debt financing. If such financing is not available to us, or is not available on satisfactory terms, our ability to continue operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, your ownership would be diluted.\nOur success depends on our ability to anticipate, identify and respond quickly to new and changing fashion trends, customer preferences and other factors, and our inability to anticipate, identify and respond to these changes and trends could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur core market, which is comprised of apparel, jewelry, accessories and gifts for women from 18 to 35-year old, is subject to rapidly shifting fashion trends, customer tastes and demands. Accordingly, our success is dependent on our ability to anticipate, identify and respond to the latest fashion trends and customer demands, and to translate such trends and demands into appropriate, saleable product offerings in a timely manner. In recent years, we believe we did not execute on policies that best enabled us to anticipate, identify and respond to these trend and demands, which we believe was the primary contributor to the decline in our comparable sales. Our merchandise buying and planning and allocation teams are primarily responsible for performing this analysis and making product purchase decisions. Our failure to anticipate, identify or react swiftly and appropriately to new and changing styles, trends or desired image preferences or to accurately anticipate and forecast demand for certain product offerings is likely to lead to lower demand for our merchandise, which could cause, among other things, sales declines, disposing excess inventories and a greater number of markdowns resulting in a decreased merchandise margin. Further, if we are not able to anticipate, identify and respond to changing fashion trends and customer preferences, we may lose customers and market share to those of our competitors who are able to better anticipate, identify and respond to such trends and preferences. Because our success depends on our brand image, our business could be materially adversely affected if new product offerings are not accepted by our customers. Our new product offerings may not be met with the same level of acceptance as our past product offerings and we may not be able to adequately respond to fashion trends in a timely manner or the preferences of our customers. If we do not accurately forecast or analyze fashion trends and sales levels, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nIf we are not able to successfully maintain a broad and shallow merchandise assortment, we may be unable to attract a sufficient number of customers to our boutiques or sell sufficient quantities of our merchandise through our ecommerce website, which could result in excess inventories and markdowns.\nWe use the term broad and shallow to refer to a diverse merchandise assortment with relatively small inventory of each product. We believe that our strategy to offer our customers a broad and shallow merchandise assortment is important to the success of our business. Among other things, we believe that this strategy creates a constant sense of newness and scarcity value, which drives repeat boutique visits and increased sales. We believe that this strategy helps us reduce markdowns. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to adequately stock our boutiques with a sufficiently broad and shallow assortment of merchandise. As we have or may increase order volumes in connection with the increase in demand of our merchandise and the expansion of our ecommerce website and begun to emphasize the congruence of our merchandise offerings throughout our boutiques, it has become increasingly difficult for us to accurately forecast the optimal amount of merchandise to order from our vendors. For example, in fiscal year 2018, there were certain products that resonated with customers, but we had not ordered enough of those products to capitalize on their popularity. If we are unable to successfully offer a broad and shallow merchandise assortment, customers may choose to visit our boutiques or our ecommerce website less frequently, our brand could be impaired, our market share may decline and our results of operations will deteriorate. Further, any failure to maintain a broad and shallow merchandise assortment could lead to excess inventories which could lead to markdowns and increased marked out-of-stock charges and promotions, which would result in a decrease in our merchandise margin.\nOur short-term business strategy depends in large part upon our ability to successfully implement our planned improvements to merchandising, reducing expenses across all areas, increasing boutique team productivity and optimizing our existing real estate portfolio.\nOur business short-term strategy is focused on improving our merchandise assortment, reducing expenses across all areas of operations, increasing boutique team productivity and rationalizing our real estate portfolio, with the goal of reducing the number of marginally profitable boutiques, through rent reductions or boutique closures, in an effort to increase the comparable sales and overall profitability of our remaining boutique footprint. As is the case with any strategy, our turnaround plan could result in unintended consequences that make executing the turnaround plan more challenging. For example, our focus on increasing boutique team productivity may make it more difficult for us to continue to offer a personalized shopping experience for our customers, which may in turn have a negative impact on our conversion rates. The estimated costs and benefits associated with these initiatives may vary materially based on various factors including: timing in execution, availability of funds to support execution, customer response to merchandise assortments, our leadership being able to continue to motivate and manage our employees, outcome of negotiations with landlords, and changes in management\u2019s assumptions and projections. As a result of these events and circumstances, delays and unexpected costs may occur, which could result in our not realizing all, or any portion of, the anticipated benefits of our short-term business strategy.\nWe may not be able to efficiently source and distribute the merchandise quantities necessary to support our operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to source and distribute merchandise efficiently. The sourcing of our merchandise is dependent, in part, on our relationships with our vendors and our vendors\u2019 confidence in our business. If we are unable to maintain these relationships, we may not be able to continue to source merchandise at competitive prices that appeal to our customers. If we do not succeed in maintaining good relationships with our vendors and cannot identify new vendors to meet the demand for additional merchandise production, the Company could see its costs go up or the delivery time on its new orders substantially increase.\nIncreases in the cost of the raw materials or other inputs used in the production of our merchandise could result in the loss of suppliers, increase our cost of goods sold and occupancy costs and adversely affect our financial results.\nThe success of our business is in part driven by the compelling price-value proposition we offer our customers. If the costs of the raw materials, particularly cotton, leather and synthetics, used in producing our merchandise increase, our vendors would look to pass these cost increases along to us. The price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors which are outside of our control, including commodity prices, crop yields, natural disasters, pandemics and weather patterns. If our vendors attempt to pass any cost increases on to us and we refuse to pay the increases, we could lose certain vendors as suppliers, resulting in the risk that we could not fill our orders in a timely manner or at all. If we pay the increases, we could either attempt to raise retail prices, which could adversely affect our sales and our brand image, or choose not to raise prices, which could adversely affect the profitability of our merchandise sales.\nChanges in laws affecting our supply chain and portions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act relating to conflict minerals, may adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of certain materials which may be used in the manufacture of some of our products.\nIf we are unable to effectively operate, replace or upgrade any of our existing information technology systems, our operations could be disrupted which could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe efficient operation of our business is significantly dependent on our information technology systems, including our ability to operate them effectively and successfully implementing new systems and controls, including, for example, the replacement of our legacy point-of-sale system and introduction of new customer relationship system which we completed in fiscal year 2017, as well as our implementation of a new warehouse management system for ecommerce in fiscal year 2018. Any failure of these systems to operate effectively or any difficulty in implementing any future information technology systems changes could disrupt and adversely impact the promptness and accuracy of our merchandise distribution, transaction processing, financial accounting and reporting, including the implementation of our internal controls over financial reporting, the efficiency of our operations and our ability to properly forecast earnings and cash requirements. Any resulting disruptions could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is sensitive to consumer spending and economic conditions.\nConsumer purchases of discretionary retail items and specialty retail products, which include our apparel, jewelry, accessories and gifts, may be adversely affected by national and regional economic, market and other conditions such as employment levels, salary and wage levels, the availability of consumer credit, inflation, high interest rates, high tax rates, high fuel prices, the threat of a pandemic or other health crisis (such as COVID-19) and consumer confidence with respect to current and future economic, market and other conditions. Consumer purchases may decline during recessionary periods or at other times when unemployment is higher or disposable income is lower. These risks may be exacerbated for retailers like us that focus significantly on selling discretionary fashion merchandise. Consumer willingness to make discretionary purchases may decline, may stall or may be slow to increase due to national and regional economic conditions. Our financial performance is particularly susceptible to economic and other conditions in regions or states where we have a significant number of boutiques. There remains considerable uncertainty and volatility in the national and global economy. Further or future slowdowns or disruptions in the economy, market and other conditions could adversely affect mall traffic and new mall and shopping center development and could materially and adversely affect us and our business strategy. We may not be able to sustain or increase our current net sales if there is a decline in consumer spending.\nA deterioration of economic conditions and future recessionary periods may exacerbate the other risks faced by our business, including those risks we encounter as we attempt to execute our business plans. Such risks could be exacerbated individually or collectively.\nWe operate in the highly competitive specialty retail apparel and accessories industry and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, which could adversely impact market share.\nWe face intense competition in the specialty retail apparel and accessories industry. We compete on the basis of a combination of factors, including price, breadth, quality and style of merchandise, as well as our in-boutique experience and level of customer service, our brand image and our ability to anticipate, identify and respond to new and changing fashion trends. While we believe that we compete primarily with specialty retailers and internet businesses that specialize in women\u2019s apparel and accessories, we also face competition from department stores, mass merchandisers and value retailers. We believe our primary competitors include specialty apparel and accessories retailers that offer their own private labels. We also face intense competition from the ecommerce platforms of our brick and mortar competitors, as well as internet-based retailers due to the continuing shift in customer demand away from brick and mortar to ecommerce. Our expansion into markets served by our competitors and entry of new competitors or expansion of existing competitors into our markets could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe also compete with a wide variety of large and small retailers for customers, vendors, suitable boutique locations and personnel. The competitive landscape we face, particularly among specialty retailers, is subject to rapid change as new competitors emerge and existing competitors change their product offerings. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully and navigate the shifts in our market.\nMany of our competitors are, and many of our potential competitors may be, larger and have greater name recognition and access to greater financial, marketing and other resources. Therefore, these competitors may be able to adapt to changes in trends and customer desires more quickly, devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products, generate greater brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can. As a result, we may lose market share, which could reduce our sales and adversely affect our results of operations. Many of our competitors also utilize advertising and marketing media, including advertising through the use of direct mail, newspapers, magazines, billboards, television and radio, which may provide them with greater brand recognition than we have given our very limited use of traditional advertising.\nOur competitors may also sell certain products or substantially similar products through the internet or through outlet centers or discount stores, increasing the competitive pressure for those products. Additionally, the internet and other new technologies facilitate competitive entry and comparison shopping. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors. Our expansion into markets served by our competitors and entry of new competitors or expansion of existing competitors into our markets could have a material adverse effect on us. Competitive forces and pressures may also intensify if our presence in the retail marketplace grows.\nWe do not possess exclusive rights to many of the elements that comprise our in-boutique experience and merchandise offerings. Some specialty retailers offer a personalized shopping experience that in certain ways is similar to the one we strive to provide to our customers. Our competitors may seek to emulate facets of our business strategy and in-boutique experience, which could result in a reduction of any competitive advantage or special appeal that we might possess. Some of our merchandise offerings are sold to us on a non-exclusive basis. As a result, our current and future competitors, especially those with greater financial, marketing or other resources, may be able to duplicate or improve upon some or all of the elements of our in-boutique experience or merchandise offerings that we believe are important in differentiating our boutiques and our customers\u2019 shopping experience. If our competitors were to duplicate or improve upon some or all of the elements of our in-boutique experience or product offerings, our competitive position and our business could suffer.\nOur ability to attract customers to our boutiques depends on locating our boutiques in suitable locations. Conditions or changes affecting boutique locations, including any further decrease in customer traffic, could cause our sales to be less than historical values and less than expected.\nBoutique locations and related sales and customer traffic may be adversely affected by, among other things, economic conditions in a particular area, competition from nearby retailers or online retailers selling similar merchandise, changing lifestyle choices of consumers in a particular market and the closing or decline in popularity of other businesses located near our boutiques. Additionally, many of our boutiques are located in shopping malls and other retail centers that benefit from the ability of \u201canchor\u201d retail tenants, generally large department centers, and other attractions, to generate sufficient levels of consumer traffic in the vicinity of our boutiques. We, along with numerous other retailers, including anchor retail tenants, have announced the closure of a significant number of stores, mainly in mall and anchor store locations. Changes in areas around our boutique locations or changes in consumer shopping patterns, including a continued shift of consumer spending from brick-and-mortar to online, that result in reductions in customer foot traffic or otherwise render the locations unsuitable could cause our sales to be less than historical values and less than expected. In addition, we may have to respond to these changes by closing additional stores, increasing markdowns or increasing promotions to reduce excess inventory in certain boutiques, which could have a material adverse effect on our margins and operating results.\nOur business depends on a strong brand image, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition, we may be unable to attract a sufficient number of customers to our boutiques or sell sufficient quantities of our merchandise.\nWe believe that our brand image and brand awareness is an important factor to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand image particularly in newer markets where we have limited brand recognition is important to maintaining and expanding our customer base. Maintaining and enhancing our brand image may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as merchandising, marketing, boutique operations, community relations, boutique promotions and employee training. These investments may be substantial and may not ultimately be successful. If they are not successful, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur use of traditional advertising channels is limited and if we fail to adequately connect with our customer base, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have historically focused on organic, viral and in-boutique marketing to capture the interest of our customers and drive them to our boutiques and website. We limit our use of traditional advertising channels, such as newspapers, magazines, billboards, television, direct mail and radio, which are used by some of our competitors. Although we continue to work to strengthen and evolve our marketing programs, including through the use of investments in influencers in digital and social media, there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful. We have increased and expect to continue to increase our use of digital advertising, including social media, such as Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest and Twitter, in the future. If our marketing efforts are not successful, there may be no immediately available or cost effective alternative marketing channel for us to use to build or maintain brand awareness. Failure to successfully connect with our target customers in new and existing markets could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on our senior management personnel and may not be able to retain or replace these individuals or recruit additional personnel, which could harm our business.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on establishing and maintaining an experienced senior management team. We are currently experiencing a Chief Executive Officer transition. On February 10, 2020, our board of directors appointed Mr. Andrew Clarke as our Chief Executive Officer effective March 9, 2020. Mr. Michael Prendergast of Alvarez & Marsal, our Interim Chief Executive Officer, then resigned from such position effective as of March 9, 2020. However, our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully or timely integrate our new Chief Executive Officer or find suitable permanent replacements for certain positions within our merchandising, planning and allocation teams. The loss of services of one or more of our senior management could impair our ability to manage our business effectively and could have an adverse effect on our business, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis or at all. Any departures of key personnel could be viewed in a negative light by investors and analysts, which could cause our common stock price to decline. We do not maintain key person insurance on any employee.\nIn addition to our senior management, we have other employees in positions, including those employees responsible for our merchandising and operations departments that, if vacant, could cause a temporary disruption in our business until such positions are filled.\nOur ability to successfully open and operate new boutiques in a timely and cost-effective manner is subject to a number of risks.\nWhile we are currently focused on optimizing our existing real estate fleet, we believe we will have an opportunity to grow our boutique base in the United States and that our long-term strategy depends upon our ability to successfully open new boutiques. The success of this strategy will depend largely upon our ability to optimize our existing real estate fleet and improve our operating margins, our ability to find a sufficient number of suitable locations, our ability to recruit, hire and train qualified personnel to operate our new boutiques and our ability to scale our infrastructure to successfully integrate our new boutiques.\nOur ability to successfully open and operate new boutiques depends on many factors that may be outside of our control including, among others, our ability to:\n\u00b7 optimize our existing real estate fleet and improve our operating margins;\n\u00b7 identify desirable boutique locations, primarily in malls, lifestyle centers, street locations and strip centers, as well as other types of shopping venues and outlet malls, which may be difficult and costly, particularly, in an improving real estate environment and as customer shopping patterns evolve;\n\u00b7 negotiate acceptable lease terms, including favorable levels of tenant allowances, which may be difficult, particularly in an improving real estate environment;\n\u00b7 maintain out-of-pocket, build-out costs in line with our boutique economic model, including by receiving expected levels of tenant allowances for a portion of our construction expenses, and managing these construction expenses at reasonable levels, which may be difficult, particularly in an improving real estate environment;\n\u00b7 efficiently source and distribute additional merchandise;\n\u00b7 hire, train and retain a growing workforce of boutique managers, boutique associates and other personnel;\n\u00b7 successfully integrate new boutiques into our existing control structure and operations, including our information technology systems;\n\u00b7 efficiently expand the operations of our distribution facility to meet the needs of a growing boutique network;\n\u00b7 identify and satisfy the merchandise and other preferences of our customers in new geographic areas and markets; and\n\u00b7 address competition, merchandising, marketing, distribution and other challenges encountered in connection with expansion into new geographic areas and markets.\nWe may open new boutiques in or near the areas where we have existing boutiques. To the extent that we open boutiques in markets where we already have existing boutiques, we may experience reduced net sales at those existing boutiques. Also, as we expand into new geographic areas, we will need to successfully identify and satisfy the fashion preferences of customers in those areas. We will need to address competition, merchandising, marketing, distribution and other challenges encountered in connection with any expansion and our limited brand recognition in new markets may limit our expansion strategy and cause our business and growth to suffer. New geographic areas may also have different operational characteristics, including employment and labor, logistics, real estate and legal requirements which may divert financial, operation and managerial resources from our existing operations.\nFinally, newly opened boutiques may not be received as well as, or achieve net sales, profitability levels or payback period on our net investment comparable to those of, our existing boutiques in our estimated time periods, or at all. If our boutiques fail to achieve, or are unable to sustain, acceptable net sales and profitability levels, our business may be materially harmed and we may incur significant costs associated with closing or relocating boutiques. Our current expansion plans are only estimates, and the actual number of boutiques we open or close each year and the actual number of suitable locations for our new boutiques could differ significantly from these estimates. If we fail to successfully open and operate new boutiques and execute our long-term growth plans, the price of our common stock could decline.\nIf we are unable to find, train and retain key personnel, including new boutique employees that reflect our brand image and embody our culture, we may not be able to grow or sustain our operations.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of boutique employees, including boutique managers, who understand and appreciate our customers, brand and corporate culture, and are able to adequately and effectively represent our culture and establish credibility with our customers. Like most retailers, we experience significant employee turnover rates, particularly among boutique employees. Our current operations require us to continuously hire and train personnel. If we are unable to hire and retain boutique personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service, as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture, understanding of our customers and knowledge of the merchandise we offer, the performance of our existing and new boutiques could be materially adversely affected and our brand image may be negatively impacted. There is a high level of competition for experienced, qualified personnel in the retail industry and we compete for personnel with a variety of companies looking to hire for retail positions. Our initiative to decrease expenses and to increase boutique team productivity may make it more difficult for us to retain employees. Historically, we have prided ourselves on our commitment to employee growth and development and we focus on promoting from within our team. If we have challenges in staffing our new boutiques, particularly at the boutique manager level, it could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain a cohesive and consistently strong team, which in turn could have an adverse impact on our business. If we are unable to attract, train and retain employees in the future, we may not be able to serve our customers effectively, thus reducing our ability to profitably operate our new and existing boutiques.\nUnion attempts to organize our employees could negatively affect our business.\nNone of our employees are currently subject to a collective bargaining agreement. However, in the future, unions may attempt to organize all or part of our employee base at certain boutiques or within certain regions. Responding to such organization attempts may distract management and employees and may have a negative financial impact on individual boutiques, or on our business as a whole.\nWe have one corporate headquarters and distribution facility and have not yet implemented disaster recovery procedures. Disruptions to the operations at that location have in the past, and could in the future, have an adverse effect on our business operations.\nOur corporate headquarters and our only distribution facility are located in Houston, Texas. Our distribution facility supports both our boutiques and our ecommerce. Most of our merchandise is shipped from our vendors to the distribution facility and then packaged and shipped from our distribution facility to our boutiques and our ecommerce customers. The success of our boutiques depends on the timely receipt of merchandise because they must receive merchandise in a timely manner in order to stay current with the fashion preferences of our customers. The efficient flow of our merchandise requires that we have adequate capacity and uninterrupted service in our distribution facility to support both our current level of operations, and the anticipated increased levels that may follow from our growth plans. We believe that our current distribution facility is capable of supporting our growth plans for several years.\nIf we encounter difficulties associated with our distribution facility or if it were to shut down for any reason, including fire, hurricanes, floods, pandemics, or other natural disaster or severe weather, we could face inventory shortages resulting in \u201cout-of-stock\u201d conditions in our boutiques, and delays in shipments to our customers, resulting in significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our merchandise. See \u201c The current geographic concentration of our boutiques creates an exposure to local economies, regional downturns and severe weather or other catastrophic occurrences that may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations \u201d below. Also, most of our computer equipment and senior management, including critical resources dedicated to merchandising, financial and administrative functions are located at our corporate headquarters. Our management and our operations and distribution staff would need to find an alternative location, causing further disruption and expense to our business and operations. For example, in August 2017, Hurricane Harvey hit south Texas which resulted in the shutdown of corporate headquarters for a few days and disruption in our supply chain for several weeks.\nWe recognize the need for, and are in the early stages of, developing disaster recovery, business continuity and document retention plans that would allow us to be operational despite casualties or unforeseen events impacting our corporate headquarters or distribution center. Without disaster recovery, business continuity and document retention plans, if we encounter difficulties or disasters with our distribution facility or at our corporate headquarters, our critical systems, operations and information may not be restored in a timely manner, or at all, and this could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur business requires that we lease substantial amounts of space and we may not be able to continue to lease space on terms as favorable as the leases negotiated in the past and the costs of exiting leases at boutiques we have identified for closure may be greater than we estimate or could be greater than the funds we raise to address closure costs, if necessary.\nWe do not own any real estate. Instead, we lease all of our boutique locations, as well as our corporate headquarters and distribution facility in Houston, Texas. Our boutiques are leased from third parties, with initial lease terms of five to ten years. Many of our lease agreements also have additional five-year renewal options. We believe that we have been able to negotiate favorable rental rates and tenant allowances over the last few years due, in large part, to the strength of our reputation as tenants, the state of the economy and higher than usual vacancy rates in a number of regional malls and shopping centers. These trends may not continue, including as a result of our effort to optimize our lease expense structure for existing and boutiques, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue to negotiate such favorable terms. Many of our leases have early cancellation clauses, which permit the lease to be terminated by us or the landlord if certain sales levels are not met in specific periods or if the shopping venue does not meet specified occupancy standards. In addition to fixed minimum lease payments, most of our boutique leases provide for additional rental payments based on a percentage of sales, or \u201cpercentage rent,\u201d if sales at the respective boutiques exceed specified levels, as well as the payment of common area maintenance charges, real property insurance and real estate taxes. Many of our lease agreements have defined escalating rent provisions over the initial term and any extensions. Increases in our already substantial occupancy costs and difficulty in identifying economically suitable new boutique locations could have significant negative consequences, which include:\n\u00b7 requiring that a greater portion of our available cash be applied to pay our rental obligations, thus reducing cash available for other purposes and reducing our profitability;\n\u00b7 increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u00b7 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, our business or in the industry in which we compete.\nWe depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to fund these expenses and needs and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us, we may not be able to service our lease expenses, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which could harm our business. Additional sites that we lease may be subject to long-term non-cancelable leases if we are unable to negotiate our current standard lease terms. If an existing or future boutique is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Moreover, even if a lease has an early cancellation clause, we may not satisfy the contractual requirements for early cancellation under that lease. If we are not able to enter into new leases or renew existing leases on terms acceptable to us, this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn connection with our strategy to optimize our real estate portfolio, our preferred approach to closing boutiques is to enter into lease termination agreements with respect to the leases at such boutiques, rather than to assign leases or to sublease the boutique premises because it allows us to avoid the risk of future liability under the leases. The costs of terminating the leases for boutiques we close may be greater than we currently estimate, in which case we may need to borrow under our Amended ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement. Further the cost to fund such liabilities is often significant and is funded through cash flow from operations. In addition, we could encounter difficulty raising the funds necessary to cover a part of the costs of terminating the leases for boutiques we intend to close. Such circumstances could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to obtain merchandise on a timely basis at competitive prices could suffer as a result of any deterioration or change in our vendor relationships or events that adversely affect our vendors or their ability to obtain financing for their operations.\nWe have many important vendor relationships that we believe provide us with a competitive advantage. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. Instead, we purchase our merchandise from third-party vendors. Our top 10 vendors sourced approximately 35% of our merchandise in fiscal year 2019 with no single vendor accounting for more than 6% of our purchases. Our business and financial performance depend in large part on our ability to evaluate merchandise quickly for style and then modify any undesirable designs or to improve the quality, look, and fit of the item. We do not have long-term contracts with any of these vendors and we generally operate without any contractual assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products. Rather, we receive and review samples almost daily for fit and fashion evaluation. Maintaining positive working relationships with our vendors is an important element of our business. Any of our vendors could discontinue supplying us with desired products in sufficient quantities for a variety of reasons.\nThe benefits we currently experience from our vendor relationships could be adversely affected if our vendors:\n\u00b7 choose to stop providing merchandise samples to us or otherwise discontinue selling merchandise to us;\n\u00b7 raise the prices they charge us;\n\u00b7 change pricing terms to require us to pay on delivery or upfront, including as a result of changes in the credit relationships some of our vendors have with their various lending institutions;\n\u00b7 reduce our access to styles, brands and merchandise by entering into broad exclusivity arrangements with our competitors or otherwise in the marketplace;\n\u00b7 sell similar merchandise to our competitors with similar or better pricing, many of whom already purchase merchandise in significantly greater volume and, in some cases, at lower prices than we do;\n\u00b7 experience reduced production, operational shutdowns, or are otherwise negatively impacted as a result of the recent COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u00b7 lose confidence in our business;\n\u00b7 lengthen their lead times; or\n\u00b7 initiate or expand sales of apparel and accessories to retail customers directly through their own stores, catalogs or on the internet and compete with us directly.\nWe historically have established good working relationships with many small- to mid-sized vendors that often have limited resources, production capacities and operating histories. Market and economic events that adversely impact our vendors could impair our ability to obtain merchandise in sufficient quantities. Such events include difficulties or problems associated with our vendors\u2019 business, finances, labor, ability to import merchandise, costs, production, insurance and reputation. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire desired merchandise in sufficient quantities on acceptable terms or at all in the future, especially if we need significantly different amounts of inventory in connection with any changes in our business needs. We may need to develop new relationships with larger vendors, as our current vendors may be unable to supply us with needed quantities and we may not be able to find similar merchandise on the same terms from larger vendors. If we are unable to acquire suitable merchandise in sufficient quantities, at acceptable prices with adequate delivery times due to the loss of or a deterioration or change in our relationship with one or more of our key vendors or events harmful to our vendors occur, it may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA failure in our ecommerce operations could significantly disrupt our business and lead to reduced sales, growth prospects and reputational damage.\nWhile accounting for only 9.0% of our net sales in each of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, our ecommerce operations is an important element of our brand and relationship with our customers. Further expanding our ecommerce business is an important part of our growth strategy. In addition to changing consumer preferences, shifting traffic patterns and related customer acquisition costs and buying trends in our ecommerce, we are vulnerable to certain additional risks and uncertainties associated with ecommerce sales, including rapid changes in technology, diversion of sales from our boutiques, credit card fraud, website downtime and other technical failures, security breaches, consumer privacy concerns, changes in state tax regimes and government regulation of internet activities. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce our ecommerce sales, increase our costs, diminish our growth prospects, and damage our brand, which could negatively impact our results of operations and stock price. Our lack of investment in our ecommerce operations in the short-term may exacerbate these risks.\nThere is no guarantee that we will be able to further expand our ecommerce operations. Many of our competitors already have ecommerce businesses that are substantially larger and more developed than ours, which places us at a competitive disadvantage. Moreover, online shopping has benefitted from technology improving the online shopping experience and, in many cases, has resulted in a shift of consumer spending from brick-and-mortar to online where competition is even greater since \u201cpure play\u201d internet retailers do not have significant occupancy costs and boutique payroll expenses like we do. If we are unable to further expand our ecommerce operations, our growth plans will suffer and the price of our common stock could decline.\nSystem security risk issues, including our failure to protect our customers\u2019 privacy and disruption of our internal operations or information technology systems, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our financial results and stock price.\nExperienced computer programmers and hackers, or even internal users, may be able to penetrate or create systems disruptions or cause shutdowns of our network security or that of third-party companies with which we have contracted to provide services. We generally collect and store customer information for marketing purposes and any compromise of customer information could subject us to customer or government litigation and harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and growth. Breaches of our system or of third party companies with which we have contracted to provide services, which would compromise our customers\u2019 private information, might cause our customers to lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information, which could cause them to discontinue usage of our website or stop shopping with us altogether. The loss of confidence from a significant data security breach involving employees could also hurt our reputation, cause employee recruiting and retention challenges, increase our labor costs and adversely affect our business and financial results. Moreover, we could incur significant expenses or disruptions of our operations in connection with system failures or data breaches. An increasing number of websites and retailers, including several large internet companies and retailers, have disclosed breaches of their security, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their sites. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems, change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we buy or license from third-parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the security and operation of the systems. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate security problems, viruses and bugs, or any problems associated with the outsourced services provided to us, could be significant, and efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service that may impede our sales, distribution or other critical functions.\nAlmost all states have adopted breach of data security statutes or regulations that require notification to consumers if the security of their personal information is breached, and at least one state has adopted regulations requiring every company that maintains or stores personal information to adopt a comprehensive written information security program. Governmental focus on data security may lead to additional legislative action, and the increased emphasis on information security may lead customers to request that we take additional measures to enhance security or restrict the manner in which we collect and use customer information to gather insights into customer behavior and craft our marketing programs. As a result, we may have to modify our business systems and practices with the goal of further improving data security, which would result in reduced net sales, increased expenditures and operating complexity. Any compromise of our security or accidental loss or theft of customer data in our possession or in the possession of third parties with which we have contracted to provide services could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure and damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and stock price.\nOur inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could materially adversely impact our business.\nThere has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms, including weblogs (blogs), social media websites (such as Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter and Instagram), and other forms of internet-based communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content to their subscribers and participants posts, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. The dissemination of information online could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of the information\u2019s accuracy. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.\nOther risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about our business, fraud and out-of-date information. The inappropriate use of social media by our customers or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.\nThe current geographic concentration of our boutiques creates an exposure to local economies, regional downturns and severe weather, including any weather patterns associated with global climate change or other catastrophic occurrences that may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operated 74 boutiques in Texas as of February 1, 2020, making Texas our largest market, representing approximately 10% of our total boutiques. We also have boutique concentration in California, Florida and the Northeast region, operating 60 boutiques, 52 boutiques and 129 boutiques in these regions, respectively, as of February 1, 2020. As a result, our business is currently more susceptible to regional conditions than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors, and we are vulnerable to economic downturns in those regions. Any unforeseen events or circumstances that negatively affect these areas could materially adversely affect our sales and profitability. These factors include, among other things, changes in demographics and population and severe weather or natural disasters.\nFurther, our corporate headquarters and only distribution center are currently located at a single facility in Houston, Texas. Our single distribution center receives, stores and distributes merchandise to all of our boutiques and fulfills all sales for our ecommerce website. Most of our computer equipment and senior management, including critical resources dedicated to merchandising and financial and administrative functions, are located at our corporate headquarters. As described elsewhere in the risk factors in this report, we do not currently have adequate disaster recovery systems and plans at our corporate headquarters and distribution facility. As a result, our business may be more susceptible to regional natural disasters, severe weather and catastrophes than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors. See \u201cWe have one corporate headquarters and distribution facility and have not yet implemented disaster recovery procedures. Disruptions to the operations at that location could have an adverse effect on our business operations\u201d above.\nA substantial number of our boutiques are located in the northeastern and southeastern United States. These regions of the United States, Texas and other states along the Gulf Coast, in particular, are prone to severe weather conditions. For example, hurricanes have passed through these regions and caused extensive damage. Adverse weather conditions impacting these regions of the United States, including any weather patterns associated with global climate change, generally could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Severe weather can also result in weather-related supply disruptions, which could impact our ability to supply boutiques as was the case of Hurricane Harvey which hit south Texas in August 2017 and caused shutdown of our corporate headquarters for a few days and disrupted our supply chain for several weeks. Weather conditions can affect our net sales because inclement weather may discourage travel or require temporary boutique closures, thereby reducing customer traffic. Unseasonably warmer weather during typically colder months or unseasonably colder weather during typically warmer months, including any weather patterns associated with global climate change, can also negatively affect the seasonal composition and demand for our merchandise, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAll of our boutique locations expose us to additional diverse risks, given that natural disasters or other unanticipated catastrophes, such as telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, fires or terrorist attacks, can occur anywhere and could cause disruptions in our operations. Extensive or multiple disruptions in our operations, whether at our boutiques or our corporate headquarters and distribution center, due to natural disasters, severe weather or other catastrophes could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and stock price.\nOur results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in energy costs.\nEnergy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for our retail boutiques and costs to purchase product from our vendors. A continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our merchandise and increase our operating costs and we may be unable to pass along to our customers such increased cost, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and stock price.\nOur net sales and merchandise inventory fluctuate on a seasonal basis, leaving our operating results susceptible to adverse changes in seasonal shopping patterns, weather and related risks.\nDue to the seasonal nature of the retail industry, we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience some fluctuations in our net sales and net income (loss). Our net sales and earnings are typically highest in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the year-end holiday season. Net sales during this period cannot be used as an accurate indicator of annual results. Likewise, as is the case with many retailers of apparel, jewelry, accessories and gifts, we typically experience lower net sales in the first fiscal quarter relative to other quarters. If for any reason, including for example poor weather conditions, soft economic environments or loss of consumer confidence, our net sales were below seasonal norms or expectations during typically higher-volume time periods, our net sales, inventory levels and results of operations could be adversely affected. In order to prepare for these higher-volume periods, we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we carry during other parts of the year. This inventory build-up may require us to expend cash faster than is generated by our operations during these periods. Any unanticipated decrease in demand for our merchandise during peak shopping periods, such as our back-to-school assortment in fiscal year 2017 that did not resonate with customers, could result in excess inventory levels which could require us to sell or dispose excess inventory at a substantial markdown, which could have an adverse effect on our business, profitability and brand image. We have experienced, and may continue to experience variability in net sales as a result of a variety of other factors, including the timing of new boutique openings and closing of underperforming boutiques, customer response to our product offerings, boutique events, other marketing activities, sales tax holidays and other holidays, which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly basis and relative to corresponding periods in prior years.\nIf our vendors fail to comply with applicable laws, including a failure to use acceptable labor practices, or if our vendors suffer disruptions in their businesses, we could suffer adverse business consequences.\nOur vendors source the merchandise sold in our boutiques and our ecommerce website from manufacturers both inside and outside of the United States. Although each of our purchase orders is subject to our vendor manuals or policies, which require compliance with labor, immigration, manufacturing and product safety, environmental and other laws, we do not supervise, control or audit our vendors or the manufacturers that produce the merchandise we sell. The violation, or perception of any violation, of any labor, immigration, manufacturing safety or other laws by any of our vendors or their U.S. and non-U.S. manufacturers, such as use of child labor, or the divergence of the labor practices followed by any of our vendors or these manufacturers from those generally accepted in the United States, could damage our brand image or subject us to boycotts by our customers or activist groups.\nAny event causing a sudden disruption of manufacturing or imports, including the imposition of additional import restrictions or the outbreak of a pandemic or contagious disease, such as COVID-19, could interrupt, or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us by our vendors and materially harm our operations. Political and financial instability outside the United States, strikes, adverse weather conditions or natural disasters that may occur or acts of war or terrorism in the United States or worldwide, may affect the production, shipment or receipt of merchandise. These factors, which are beyond our control, could materially hurt our business, financial condition and results of operations or may require us to modify our current business practices or incur increased costs.\nChanges in laws, including employment laws, tax laws, imposition of new tariffs and laws related to our merchandise could make conducting our business more expensive or otherwise cause us to change the way we do business.\nWe are subject to numerous regulations, including taxation, labor and employment, truth-in-advertising, consumer protection, product safety, environmental and zoning and occupancy laws and ordinances that regulate retailers generally or govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of boutiques and warehouse facilities. If these regulations were to change or were violated by our management, employees or vendors, the costs of certain goods could increase, or we could experience delays in shipments of our goods, be subject to fines, penalties or other liabilities or suffer reputational harm, which could reduce demand for our merchandise and hurt our business and results of operations.\nIn addition to increased regulatory compliance requirements, changes in laws could make the ordinary conduct of our business more expensive or require us to change the way we do business. Laws related to employee benefits and treatment of employees, including laws related to limitations on employee hours, immigration laws, child labor laws, supervisory status, leaves of absence, mandated health benefits or overtime pay, could also negatively impact us, such as by increasing compensation and benefits costs for overtime and medical expenses. Moreover, changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws (including the implementation of new privacy protection laws) could lead to increased costs to us for some merchandise, or additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale. It is often difficult for us to plan and prepare for potential changes to applicable laws, and future actions or payments related to these changes could be material to us.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which may require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to service debt and limit our financial and operating flexibility in important ways.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Any borrowings under any future debt financing will require interest payments and need to be repaid or refinanced, could require us to divert funds identified for other purposes to debt service and would create additional cash demands and could impair our liquidity position and add financial risk for us. Diverting funds identified for other purposes for debt service may adversely affect our business and growth prospects. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may need to refinance our debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain necessary funds. We do not know whether we would be able to take any of these actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us, or at all.\nOur level of indebtedness has important consequences to you and your investment in our common stock. For example, our level of indebtedness may:\n\u00b7 require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our debt, which would reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7 limit our ability to pay future dividends;\n\u00b7 limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans and other investments, which may limit our ability to implement our business strategy;\n\u00b7 heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the specialty apparel and accessories retail industry or in the general economy and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the specialty apparel and accessories retail industry; or\n\u00b7 prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise or successfully carrying out our plans to expand our boutique base and product offerings.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make payments on our indebtedness or to fund our operations.\nThe terms of our Amended ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement do, and the terms of any additional debt financing may, restrict our current and future operations, which could adversely affect our ability to manage our operations and respond to changes in our business.\nOur Amended ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement contain, and any additional debt financing we may incur would likely contain, covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, grant liens, make certain investments, acquisitions loans and advances, sell assets, pay dividends or make distributions or other restricted payments, prepay other indebtedness, engage in mergers or consolidations, change the business conducted by Francesca\u2019s Collections and its subsidiaries, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries or amend certain charter documents and material agreements governing subordinated and junior indebtedness. As disclosed above in the \u201cRecent Developments\u201d section, in May 2020, we entered into the JPM Letter Agreement and Tiger Letter Agreement which waived any default or event of default arising from our failure to (i) deliver annual audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2020 without a \u201cgoing concern\u201d or a like qualification or exception and (ii) pay rent on leased locations for the months of April, May and June, 2020. The JPM Letter Agreement and Tiger Letter Agreement contain certain conditions and covenants, including that, in the case of the JPM Letter Agreement, we are required to use the entire $10.7 million income tax refund requested under the CARES Act to repay certain outstanding borrowings under the Amended ABL Credit Agreement and providing that no loans will be made under the ABL Credit Agreement unless our aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents is less than $3.0 million. A failure by us to comply with the covenants or financial ratios contained in our Amended ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement, including if we are unable or elect not to pay rent on our leased locations beginning in July 2020 and do not otherwise obtain a waiver from our lenders, or any additional debt financing we may incur could result in an event of default, which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be due and payable and exercise other remedies. If the indebtedness under our Amended ABL Credit Facility and Term Loan Credit Agreement, including if we are unable or elect not to pay rent on our leased locations beginning in July 2020 and do not otherwise obtain a waiver from our lenders, or any additional debt financing we may incur were to be accelerated, our future financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe phase out of LIBOR could increase our interest costs on our existing and future debt.\nOur Amended ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement use the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a reference rate for borrowings thereunder, such that the interest rate applicable to such loans may, at our option, be calculated based on LIBOR. In July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021, or whether any alternative reference rate, such as the Secured Oversight Financing Rate (also known as SOFR) will attain market acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR. We have material borrowings under our Amended ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement that are indexed to LIBOR. At this time, we cannot predict how markets will respond to these proposed alternative rates or the effect of any changes to LIBOR or the discontinuation of LIBOR. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we will need to enter into an amendment to the Amended ABL Agreement and Term Loan and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our lenders. If our lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, we may experience potential increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt, which could adversely impact our interest expense, results of operations and cash flows.\nAny further impairment to the carrying value of our operating lease right-of-use assets or property and equipment could result in significant non-cash charges and could have a material adverse effect on our operational results.\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles, we evaluate long-lived assets held for use, including operating lease right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets, and held for sale whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred. As of February 1, 2020, we had approximately $208.5 million of operating lease ROU assets and $51.5 million of property and equipment. Current and future economic conditions, as well as the other risks noted in this Item 1A, may adversely impact our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers, maintain sales volumes and maintain margins. As discussed under \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d included elsewhere in this report, these events could materially reduce our profitability and cash flows which could, in turn, lead to a further impairment of our long-lived assets. Furthermore, significant negative industry or general economic, market or other trends, disruptions to our business and unexpected significant changes or planned changes in our use of long-lived assets may result in additional impairments to our long-lived assets. As described in Note 5, Asset Impairment Charges, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein, we recorded a non-cash asset impairment charge of $11.9 million in fiscal year 2019, which is primarily related to the write-off of operating lease ROU assets for 60 underperforming boutiques. This compares to non-cash impairment charge of $20.1 million in fiscal year 2018, which was primarily related to the write-off of boutique assets for 153 underperforming boutiques. Additionally, the asset impairment charge in fiscal year 2018 included a $4.9 million charge associated with the write-off of boutique furniture, fixtures and supplies that were no longer expected to be used as a result of postponing new boutique openings and remodels in future periods. There can be no assurance that we will not experience further impairment charges with respect to operating lease ROU assets or property and equipment in future periods. Any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are involved on an ongoing basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise that could distract management from our business activities and result in significant liability or damage to our brand.\nWe face the risk of litigation and other claims against us. We are involved on an ongoing basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business or otherwise, which may include class actions involving consumers, shareholders or employees, and claims relating to employees, commercial disputes, landlord-tenant disputes, intellectual property issues, product-oriented allegations and slip and fall claims. These actions and claims can raise complex factual and legal issues that are subject to risks and uncertainties and could require significant management time. Litigation and other actions and claims against us could result in unexpected expenses and liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our operations and our reputation.\nWe may be unable to protect our trademarks or other intellectual property rights.\nWe believe that our trademarks are integral to our boutique design, our ecommerce and our success in building our brand image and customer loyalty. We rely on trademark registrations and common law trademark rights to protect the distinctiveness of our brand and have registered those trademarks that we believe are important to our business with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We cannot provide assurance that these registrations will prevent imitation of our name, merchandising concept, boutique design or private label merchandise, or the infringement of our other intellectual property rights by others. In most cases, the merchandise we sell is purchased on a non-exclusive basis from vendors that also sell to our competitors. While we use our brand name on these items, our competitors may seek to replicate aspects of our business strategy and in-boutique experience, thereby diluting the experience we offer and adversely affecting our brand and competitive position. Imitation of our name, concept, boutique design or merchandise in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation of our brand image could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are not aware of any claims of infringement upon or challenges to our right to use any of our brand names or trademarks in the United States. Nevertheless, we cannot be certain that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks will be adequate to prevent imitation of our merchandise by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our merchandise as a violation of the trademarks or proprietary rights of others. Although we cannot currently estimate the likelihood of success of any such lawsuit or ultimate resolution of such a conflict, such a controversy could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If disputes arise in the future, we may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction.\nWe are currently in the process of registering our trademarks in several foreign countries to seek protection outside the United States. However, international protection of our brand image and the use of these marks may be unavailable or could be limited. Also, other entities may have rights to trademarks that contain portions of our marks or may have registered similar or competing marks for merchandise in foreign countries in which our vendors source our merchandise. There may also be other prior registrations of trademarks identical or similar to our trademarks in other foreign countries of which we are not aware. Accordingly, it may be possible for others to prevent the manufacture of our branded goods in certain foreign countries or the sale or exportation of our branded goods from certain foreign countries to the United States. If we were unable to reach a licensing arrangement with these parties, our vendors may be unable to manufacture our merchandise in those countries. Our inability to register our trademarks or purchase or license the right to use our trademarks or logos in these jurisdictions could limit our ability to obtain supplies from less costly markets or penetrate new markets should our business plan change to include selling our merchandise in those foreign jurisdictions.\nLitigation may be necessary to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights or to enforce these rights. Any litigation or claims brought by us could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may be subject to liability and other risks if we, our vendors or the manufacturers of our merchandise infringe upon the trademarks or other intellectual property rights of third parties, including the risk that we could acquire merchandise from our vendors without the full right to sell it.\nWe purchase merchandise that may be subject to design copyrights, design patents or otherwise may incorporate protected intellectual property. While we are not involved in the manufacture of any of the merchandise we purchase from our vendors for sale to our customers, we may be subject to liability if our vendors or the manufacturers of our merchandise infringe upon the trademarks or other intellectual property rights of third parties. We do not independently investigate whether our vendors or the manufacturers with whom they do business legally hold intellectual property rights to the merchandise we purchase. Third parties may bring legal claims, or threaten to bring legal claims, against us that their intellectual property rights are being infringed or violated by our use of intellectual property. Litigation or threatened litigation could be costly and distract our senior management from operating our business. If we were to be found liable for any such infringement, we could be required to pay substantial damages and could be subject to injunctions preventing further infringement. Any payments we are required to make and any injunctions with which we are required to comply as a result of infringement claims could be costly and thereby adversely affect our financial results.\nIf a third party claims to have licensing rights with respect to merchandise we purchased from a vendor, or if we acquire unlicensed merchandise, we may be obligated to remove this merchandise from our boutiques, incur costs associated with this removal if the distributor or vendor is unwilling or unable to reimburse us and be subject to liability under various civil and criminal causes of action, including actions to recover unpaid royalties and other damages and injunctions. Additionally, we will be required to purchase new merchandise to replace any we remove.\nWe rely upon independent third-party transportation providers for substantially all of our merchandise shipments.\nWe currently rely upon independent third-party transportation providers for substantially all of our merchandise shipments, including shipments to all of our boutiques and our direct customers. Our use of outside delivery services for shipments is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, and employee strikes and inclement weather, which may impact a shipper\u2019s ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs. If we change shipping companies, we could face logistical difficulties that could adversely impact deliveries and we would incur costs and expend resources in connection with such change. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those received from the independent third-party transportation providers we currently use, which would increase our costs.\nDisruptions in transportation, including disruptions at shipping ports through which our merchandise are imported, could prevent us from timely distribution and delivery of merchandise, which could reduce our net sales and operating margin.\nFrom time to time, shipping ports experience capacity constraints, labor strikes, work stoppages or other disruptions that may delay the delivery of imported products. A lengthy contract dispute may lead to protracted delays in the movement of our merchandise, which could further delay the delivery of merchandise to our boutiques and impact net sales and operating margin. Other conditions outside of our control, such as adverse weather conditions or acts of terrorism, could significantly disrupt operations at shipping ports or otherwise impact transportation of the imported merchandise we sell.\nFuture disruptions in transportation services or at a shipping port at which our merchandise are received may result in delays in the transportation of such merchandise to our distribution center and may ultimately delay the distribution to our boutiques resulting in reduced net sales and / or profitability.\nOur ability to source our merchandise efficiently and profitably could be hurt if new trade restrictions are imposed, existing trade restrictions become more burdensome, or the countries where our merchandise are sourced experience political instability.\nWe currently purchase all of our inventory from domestic vendors, who source our merchandise both domestically and internationally. We believe most of the merchandise sourced by our vendors was produced outside of the United States. These vendors, to the extent they obtain merchandise from outside of the United States, are subject to trade restrictions, including tariffs, safeguards or quotas, changes to which could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us. Under the World Trade Organization Agreement, effective January 1, 2005, the United States and other World Trade Organization member countries removed quotas on goods from World Trade Organization members, which in certain instances we believe afford our vendors greater flexibility in importing textile and apparel products from World Trade Organization countries from which they source our merchandise. However, as the removal of quotas resulted in an import surge from China, the United States imposed safeguard quotas on a number of categories of goods and apparel from China and may impose additional quotas in the future. These and other trade restrictions could have a significant impact on our vendors\u2019 sourcing patterns in the future. The extent of this impact, if any, and the possible effect on our purchasing patterns and costs, cannot be determined at this time. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our vendors\u2019 merchandise is currently manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States or foreign governments, nor can we predict the likelihood, type or effect of any restrictions. Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards and customs restrictions against items we offer in our boutiques, as well as United States or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise to our vendors, and we would expect the costs to be passed along in increased prices to us, which could hurt our profitability.\nAdditionally, political instability or acts of terrorism, significant fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies and restrictions on the transfer of funds between the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, any of which if they effect the countries where our merchandise are sourced, could adversely affect our merchandise flow and, consequently, cause our sales to decline.\nIncreases in the minimum wage could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nFrom time to time, legislative proposals are made to increase the federal minimum wage in the United States, as well as the minimum wage in a number of individual states and municipalities. Legislation to increase the minimum wage has been approved or is being contemplated in some states in which we operate. Base wage rates for many of our employees are at or slightly above the minimum wage. As federal or state minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wage rates of our minimum wage employees, but also the wages paid to our other hourly employees as well. Any increase in the cost of our labor could have an adverse effect on our operating costs, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a limited duration stockholder rights plan, which could delay or discourage a merger, tender offer, or assumption of control of the Company not approved by our Board of Directors.\nOn July 31, 2019, our Board of Directors adopted a limited duration stockholder rights plan (the \u201cRights Plan\u201d) with an expiration date of August 1, 2022 and an ownership trigger threshold of 15%, subject to certain exceptions. In connection with the Rights Plan, our Board of Directors authorized and declared a dividend to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 15, 2019 of one preferred share purchase right (a \u201cRight\u201d) for each outstanding share of our common stock.\nUpon certain triggering events (none of which has occurred as of February 1, 2020), each Right will entitle the holder to purchase from us one five-thousandth (subject to adjustment) of one share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d) at an exercise price of $18.00 (the \u201cExercise Price\u201d) per one five-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock. In addition, if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Company\u2019s common stock without prior approval of our Board of Directors, or in the case of a person or group that beneficially owned more than 15% of our common stock prior to the issuance of the press release announcing the adoption of the Rights Agreement on August 2, 2019, such person or group acquires beneficial ownership of any additional shares of our common stock without prior approval of our Board of Directors, each holder of a Right (other than the acquiring person or group whose Rights will become void) will have the right to purchase, upon payment of the Exercise Price and in accordance with and subject to adjustment under the terms of the Rights Plan, a number of shares of our common stock having a market value of twice the Exercise Price (as adjusted).\nThe Rights Plan is intended to enable all of our stockholders to realize the value of their investment in the Company, ensure that all stockholders receive fair treatment, and provide our Board of Directors and stockholders with adequate time to make informed decisions. The Rights Plan is not intended to deter offers that are fair and otherwise in the best interests of the Company\u2019s stockholders. However, the Rights Plan could render more difficult, or discourage, a merger, tender offer, or assumption of control of the Company that is not approved by our Board of Directors, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders. These deterrents could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees or agents or stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer employee or agent, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. This exclusive forum provision is intended to apply to claims arising under Delaware state law and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933, each as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. The exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations. This exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees or agents, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees and agents. In addition, stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. However, the enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies' certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find this type of provision to be inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provision contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we might incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.\nIf we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market, it could result in our common stock being delisted, which could adversely affect the market price and liquidity of our securities and could have other adverse effects.\nOur common stock is currently listed for trading on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. We must satisfy Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements, including, among others, a minimum stockholders\u2019 equity of\u2009$5.0 million and a minimum bid price for our common stock of\u2009$1.00 per share, or risk possibly delisting, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. On February 1, 2019, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications staff of Nasdaq indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of our common stock for the prior 30 consecutive business days, we no longer met the requirement of the Nasdaq Global Select Market to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1). As discussed under \u201cRecent Developments\u201d included elsewhere in this report, on July 1, 2019, we effected a 12-to-1 stock split in order to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement and, on July 17, 2019, Nasdaq informed us that we had regained full compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements. On April 17, 2020, Nasdaq filed a proposed rule change, which has now become effective, to permit a longer period of time for companies to regain compliance with the minimum bid price and market value of publicly held shares by tolling the compliance period through June 30, 2020. Upon expiration of the tolling period, if we do not maintain compliance with the Nasdaq continuing listing requirements, our common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market and it could be more difficult to buy or sell our securities and to obtain accurate quotations, and the price of our common stock could suffer a material decline. In addition, a delisting would impair our ability to raise capital through the public markets, could deter broker-dealers from making a market in or otherwise seeking or generating interest in our securities and might deter certain institutions and persons from investing in our securities at all.\nAnti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay and discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider to be favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that make it difficult for our stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors, preventing them from changing the composition of management. The same provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions, among other things:\n\u00b7 establish a staggered, or classified, board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u00b7 prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u00b7 authorize the issuance by our board of directors of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super-majority voting, special approval, dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u00b7 limit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u00b7 prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; and\n\u00b7 establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nThese anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could substantially impede the ability of our common stockholders to benefit from a change in control and, as a result, could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock and your ability to realize any potential change-in-control premium.", "PERMNO": 12915, "SIC": 5621, "TIC": "FRAN"}
