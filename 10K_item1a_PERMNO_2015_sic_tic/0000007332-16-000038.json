RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock.\nNatural gas, oil and natural gas liquids prices greatly affect our revenues, profitability, liquidity and growth and the value of our assets.\nOur revenues, profitability, liquidity and growth and the value of our assets greatly depend upon prices for natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids. The markets for these commodities have been volatile, and we expect that volatility to continue. The prices of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand (global, regional and local), transportation costs, market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control. Short- and long-term prices are subject to a myriad of factors such as:\n\u00b7\noverall demand, including the relative cost of competing sources of energy or fuel;\n\u00b7\noverall supply, including costs of production;\n\u00b7\nthe availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, other transportation facilities and gathering, processing and storage facilities;\n\u00b7\nregional basis differentials;\n\u00b7\nnational and worldwide economic and political conditions;\n\u00b7\nweather conditions and seasonal trends;\n\u00b7\ngovernment regulations, such as regulation of natural gas transportation and price controls;\n\u00b7\ninventory levels; and\n\u00b7\nmarket perceptions of future prices, whether due to the foregoing factors or others.\nFor example, in 2015 and 2014, our production was approximately 92% and 100% natural gas, respectively, and during this period spot prices ranged from a high of $8.15 per Mcf in February 2014 to a low of $1.63 per Mcf in December 2015. These price changes are not predictable.\nIn our exploration and production business, lower natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids prices directly reduce our revenues and thus our operating income and cash flow. Lower prices also reduce the projected profitability of further drilling and therefore are likely to reduce our drilling activity, which in turn means we will have fewer wells on production in the future. See \u201cSignificant capital expenditures are required to replace our reserves and conduct our business.\u201d Lower prices also reduce the value of our assets, both by a direct reduction in what the production would be worth and by making some properties uneconomic, resulting in impairments to the recorded value of our reserves and non-cash charges to earnings. For example, in 2015, we reported a non-cash impairment charge on our natural gas and oil properties of $7.0 billion, primarily resulting from a 41% decrease in trailing 12-month average first-day-of-the-month natural gas prices as of December 31, 2015, as compared to December 31, 2014, and the impairment of certain undeveloped leasehold interests. Current 2016 forward pricing will likely result in additional impairments to our natural gas and oil properties in the first quarter of 2016 ranging from approximately $300 million to $500 million, net of tax, when excluding future changes in costs excluded from amortization, with likely material impairments continuing beyond the first quarter. Further impairments in subsequent periods will occur if the trailing 12-month commodity prices continue to fall as compared to the average used in prior periods.\nIn our Midstream Services segment, lower production by us and others can mean reduced volumes being transported in the gathering systems we operate and thus lower revenues.\nThe dramatic drop in prices in the past two years has reduced our revenues, profits and cash flow, caused us to record significant asset impairments and led us to reduce both our level of capital investing, which may result in lower production levels, and our workforce, which has caused us to incur significant expenses relating to terminations. Further price decreases could have similar consequences. Similarly, a rise in prices to levels experienced in 2013 and into the middle of 2014 could significantly increase our revenues, profits and cash flow, which could be used to expand capital investments and thus future production.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nSignificant capital expenditures are required to replace our reserves and conduct our business.\nOur exploration, development and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. We intend to fund our capital expenditures through net cash flows from operations. Our ability to generate operating cash flow is subject to many of the risks and uncertainties that exist in our industry, some of which we may not be able to anticipate at this time. Future cash flows from operations are subject to a number of risks and variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, prices of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids, our success in developing and producing new reserves and the other risk factors discussed herein. If we are unable to fund capital expenditures, we could experience a further curtailment of our exploration and production operations, a loss of properties and a decline in our natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids production and reserves. In particular, prices at the levels experienced in December 2015 and January 2016, should they continue, would not support any material new drilling or acquisitions.\nIf we are not able to replace reserves, we may not be able to grow or sustain production.\nOur future success depends largely upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional natural gas, oil and NGL reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful development, exploration or acquisition activities, our proved reserves and production will decline over time. In addition, approximately 7% of our total estimated proved reserves (by volume) as of December 31, 2015 were undeveloped. Recovery of such reserves will require significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. Thus, our future natural gas and oil reserves and production, and therefore our cash flow and income, are highly dependent on our level of capital investments, our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves.\nA further downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital and our liquidity.\nActual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could affect the market value of our senior notes and increase our corporate borrowing costs, including the interest rates charged under our credit facility and term loan credit facility. Such ratings are limited in scope, and do not address all material risks relating to us, but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued of the likelihood we will be able to repay our debt. An explanation of the significance of such rating may be obtained from such rating agency. As of February 23, we were rated B1 by Moody\u2019s, BB+ by Standard and Poor\u2019s and BBB- by Fitch Investor Services. There can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency\u2019s judgment, circumstances so warrant.\nActual downgrades in our credit ratings may also impact our liquidity. Many of our existing commercial contracts contain, and future commercial contracts may contain, provisions permitting the counterparty to require increased security upon the occurrence of a downgrade in our credit rating. Providing additional security, such as the posting of a letter of credit, could reduce our available cash or our liquidity under our revolving credit facility for other purposes. The amount of additional security would depend on the severity of the downgrade from the credit rating agencies, and a downgrade could result in a material decrease in our liquidity.\nLower commodity prices may impair our ability to service our existing debt or refinance it when it becomes due.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $4.7 billion of debt outstanding, consisting principally of $3.9 billion in long-term senior notes maturing in various increments from 2017 to 2025, $750 million in a term loan due in 2018 and $116 million under our revolving credit agreement, which also matures in 2018. At current commodity price levels, our net cash flow from operations is substantially higher than our interest obligations under this debt, but further significant drops in prices could affect our ability to pay our current obligations or refinance our debt as it becomes due.\nMoreover, general industry conditions may make it difficult or costly to refinance increments of this debt as it matures. Our current credit agreements and indentures do not contain significant covenants restricting our operations and other activities, but future credit arrangements could impose such restrictions. Our inability to pay our current obligations or refinance our debt as it becomes due could have a material and adverse effect on our company.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nStrategic determinations, including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities, are challenging in the face of shifting market conditions, and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our future growth rate.\nWe necessarily must consider future price and cost environments when deciding how much capital we are likely to have available from net cash flow and how best to allocate it. Our current philosophy is to operate within net cash flow and to invest capital in projects only if they are projected to generate a PVI of 1.3 or greater. Volatility in prices and potential errors in estimating costs, reserves or timing of production of the reserves could result in uneconomic projects or economic projects generating less than 1.3 PVI.\nCertain of our undeveloped assets are subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.\nLeases on approximately 158,879 (including 158,231 net acres held on federal lands that are currently suspended by the Bureau of Land Management) net acres of our Fayetteville Shale acreage will expire in the next three years if we do not drill successful wells to develop the acreage or otherwise take action to extend the leases. Approximately 100,787 and 91,572 net acres of our Northeast Appalachia and Southwest Appalachia acreage, respectively, will expire in the next three years if we do not drill successful wells to develop the acreage or otherwise take action to extend the leases. Our ability to drill wells depends on a number of factors, including certain factors that are beyond our control, such as the ability to obtain permits on a timely basis or to compel landowners or lease holders on adjacent properties to cooperate. Further, we may not have sufficient capital to drill all the wells necessary to hold the acreage without increasing our debt levels. To the extent we do not drill the wells, our rights to acreage can be lost.\nNatural gas and oil drilling and producing operations can be hazardous and may expose us to liabilities.\nExploration and production operations are subject to many risks, including well blowouts, cratering and explosions, pipe failures, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine or well fluids, severe weather, natural disasters, groundwater contamination and other environmental hazards and risks. Some of these risks or hazards could materially and adversely affect our revenues and expenses by reducing or shutting in production from wells, loss of equipment or otherwise negatively impacting the projected economic performance of our prospects. If any of these risks occurs, we could sustain substantial losses as a result of:\n\u00b7\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u00b7\nsevere damage to or destruction of property, natural resources or equipment;\n\u00b7\npollution or other environmental damage;\n\u00b7\nclean-up responsibilities;\n\u00b7\nregulatory investigations and administrative, civil and criminal penalties; and\n\u00b7\ninjunctions resulting in limitation or suspension of operations.\nFor our non-operated properties, we are dependent on the operator for operational and regulatory compliance.\nOur midstream operations are subject to all of the risks and operational hazards inherent in transporting natural gas and ethane and natural gas compression, including:\n\u00b7\ndamages to pipelines, facilities and surrounding properties caused by third parties, severe weather, natural disasters, including hurricanes, and acts of terrorism;\n\u00b7\nmaintenance, repairs, mechanical or structural failures;\n\u00b7\ndamages to, loss of availability of and delays in gaining access to interconnecting third-party pipeline;\n\u00b7\ndisruption or failure of information technology systems and network infrastructure due to various causes, including unauthorized access or attack; and\n\u00b7\nleaks of natural gas or ethane as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities.\nA material event such as those described above could expose us to liabilities, monetary penalties or interruptions in our business operations. Although we may maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks described above, our insurance may not be adequate to cover casualty losses or liabilities, and our insurance does not cover penalties or fines that may be assessed by a governmental authority. Also, in the future we may not be able to obtain insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur current and future levels of indebtedness may adversely affect our results and limit our growth.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had long-term indebtedness of $4.7 billion, including borrowings of $116 million under our revolving credit facility and $750 million under our term loan credit agreement. The terms of the indentures relating to our outstanding senior notes, our credit facilities, and the master lease agreements relating to our drilling rigs and other equipment, which we collectively refer to as our \u201cfinancing agreements,\u201d impose restrictions on our ability and, in some cases, the ability of our subsidiaries to take a number of actions that we may otherwise desire to take, which may include, without limitation, one or more of the following:\n\u00b7\nincurring additional debt;\n\u00b7\nredeeming stock or redeeming debt;\n\u00b7\nmaking investments;\n\u00b7\ncreating liens on our assets; and\n\u00b7\nselling assets.\nUnder our revolving credit facility and term loan facility, we must keep our total debt at or below 60% of our total adjusted book capital. This financial covenant with respect to capitalization percentages excludes the effects of any non-cash impacts from any full cost ceiling impairments, certain non-cash hedging activities and our pension and other postretirement liabilities. Therefore, under our revolving credit facility, our adjusted capital structure as of December 31, 2015, was 38% debt and 62% equity. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2015. Although we do not anticipate any violations of our financial covenants, our ability to comply with these covenants are dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control, such as the market prices for natural gas, oil and NGLs.\nAlthough the indentures governing the notes contain covenants that apply to us, covenants limiting liens and sale and leaseback covenants contain exceptions and limitations that would allow us, pursuant to the terms of the indenture, to create, grant or incur certain liens or security interests. Moreover, the indentures do not contain any limitations on the ability of us or our subsidiaries to incur debt, pay dividends, make investments, or limit the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us. Such activities may, however, be limited by our other financing agreements in certain circumstances.\nOur level of indebtedness and off-balance sheet obligations, and the covenants contained in our financing agreements, could have important consequences for our operations, including:\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures and other general business activities;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other activities;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u00b7\ndetracting from our ability to successfully withstand a downturn in our business or the economy generally.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in our financing agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic and financial conditions.\nIf we fail to comply with the covenants and other restrictions, it could lead to an event of default and the acceleration of our obligations under the notes or our other financing agreements, and in the case of the lease agreements for drilling rigs, loss of use of our drilling rigs. In particular, a significant or extended decline in natural gas, oil or NGL prices would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, our access to capital and the quantities of natural gas, oil and NGLs that we can produce economically. For example, the New York Mercantile Exchange, or NYMEX, natural gas prices traded at a high of $3.19 in January 2015 and a low of $2.03 in November 2015 based on last-day-of-month settlement. We may not have sufficient funds to make such payments. If we are unable to satisfy our obligations with cash on hand, we could attempt to refinance such debt, sell assets or repay such debt with the proceeds from an equity offering. We cannot assure that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, to meet our lease obligations, or that future borrowings, equity financings or proceeds from the sale of assets will be available to pay or refinance such debt or obligations. The terms of our financing agreements may also prohibit us from taking such actions. Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock, a refinancing of our debt or a sale of assets include financial market conditions and our market value and operating performance at the time of such offering or other financing. We cannot assure\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nthat any such proposed offering, refinancing or sale of assets can be successfully completed or, if completed, that the terms will be favorable to us.\nWe have made significant investments in pipelines and gathering systems and contracts and in oilfield service businesses, including our drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment and sand mine operations, to lower costs and secure inputs for our operations and transportation for our production. If our exploration and production activities are curtailed or disrupted, we may not recover our investment in these activities, which could adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, our continued expansion of these operations may adversely impact our relationships with third-party providers.\nThrough December 31, 2015, we had invested approximately $1.2 billion in our gas gathering system built for the Fayetteville Shale. We may make further substantial investments in the expansion of this system. Our ability to recover the costs of these investments depends on production from the Fayetteville Shale, and reduced production volumes, whether due to lower drilling activity due to lower prices or failure to produce significant quantities of gas in relevant timeframes, can adversely affect our ability to recover these investments.\nWe also have entered into gathering agreements in other producing areas and multiple long-term firm transportation agreements relating to natural gas volumes from all our producing areas. As of December 31, 2015, our aggregate demand charge commitments under these firm transportation agreements and gathering agreements were approximately $8.9 billion. If our development programs fail to produce sufficient quantities of natural gas and ethane within expected timeframes, we could be forced to pay demand or other charges for transportation on pipelines and gathering systems that we would not be using.\nWe also have made significant investments to meet certain of our field services\u2019 needs, including establishing our own drilling rig operation, sand mine and pressure pumping capability. Reductions in our operating plans caused by the recent drop in commodity prices has caused us to take much of this equipment out of service and has reduced the need for sand and other services. If our level of operations is reduced for a long period, we may not be able to recover these investments. Further, our presence in these service and supply sectors, including competing with them for qualified personnel and supplies, may have an adverse effect on our relationships with our existing third-party service and resource providers or our ability to secure these services and resources from other providers.\nWe may be unable to dispose of assets on attractive terms, and may be required to retain liabilities for certain matters.\nVarious factors could materially affect our ability to dispose of assets or complete announced dispositions, including the availability of purchasers willing to purchase the assets at prices acceptable to us, particularly in times of reduced and volatile commodity prices. Sellers typically retain certain liabilities for certain matters. The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and ultimately may be material. Also, as is typical in divestiture transactions, third parties may be unwilling to release us from guarantees or other credit support provided prior to the sale of the divested assets. As a result, after a sale, we may remain secondarily liable for the obligations guaranteed or supported to the extent that the buyer of the assets fails to perform these obligations.\nOur business depends on the availability of water and the ability to dispose of water. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to obtain or dispose of water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWith current technology, water is an essential component of drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle water after use, could adversely impact our operations. In some cases, water may need to be obtained from new sources and transported to drilling sites, resulting in increased costs. Moreover, the introduction of new environmental initiatives and regulations related to water acquisition or waste water disposal, including produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of hydrocarbons, could limit or prohibit our ability to utilize hydraulic fracturing or waste water injection control wells.\nIn addition, concerns have been raised about the potential for earthquakes to occur from the use of underground injection control wells, a predominant method for disposing of waste water from natural gas and oil activities. New rules and regulations may be developed to address these concerns, possibly limiting or eliminating the ability to use disposal wells in certain locations and increasing the cost of disposal in others. We operate injection wells and utilize injection wells owned by third parties to dispose of waste water associated with our operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCompliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage, and use of water necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells or the disposal of water may increase our operating costs or may cause us to delay, curtail or discontinue our exploration and development plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur producing properties are concentrated in two regions, the Appalachian Basin and the Fayetteville Shale, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in limited geographic areas.\nOur producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas and the Appalachian Basin in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. At December 31, 2015, 47% of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in the Appalachian Basin and 53% in the Fayetteville Shale. As a result of this concentration in two primary regions, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, state politics, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, availability of equipment and personnel, water shortages or interruption of the processing or transportation of natural gas, oil or natural gas liquids.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market natural gas, oil and NGLs and secure trained personnel.\nOur ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing natural gas and oil and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and gas industry. Certain of our competitors may possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources greater than ours. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive natural gas and oil properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. In addition, companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. This may become more likely if prices for oil and NGLs recover faster than prices for natural gas, as natural gas comprises a far greater percentage of our overall production than it does for most of the companies with whom we compete for talent. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nVolatility in the financial markets or in global economic factors could adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nUnited States and global economies may experience periods of turmoil and volatility from time to time, which may be characterized by diminished liquidity and credit availability, inability to access capital markets, high unemployment, unstable consumer confidence and diminished consumer spending. In recent periods, there has been significant downward pressure on natural gas, oil and NGL prices, and a continuation of that trend could continue or exacerbate that pressure. This would negatively impact our revenues, margins, profitability, operating cash flows, liquidity and financial condition. Such weakness or uncertainty could also cause our natural gas hedging arrangements or future oil or NGL hedges, if any, to become economically ineffective if our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations or seek bankruptcy protection. Furthermore, our ability to collect receivables may be adversely impacted.\nHistorically, we have used cash flows from operations, borrowings under our credit facility and proceeds from capital market transactions to fund capital expenditures. Volatility in U.S. and global financial markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, and interest rate volatility, may result in our inability to obtain needed capital on acceptable terms or at all and may increase our cost of financing. We have a credit facility with lender commitments totaling $2.0 billion, which may be increased up to a total of $2.5 billion upon agreement with participating lenders, and a term loan credit agreement with lender commitments for an additional $750 million. We also have $3.9 billion in senior notes maturing in various increments from 2017 to 2025. In the future, regardless of our company\u2019s situation, conditions in financial markets may limit our ability to access adequate funding under our credit facility if our lenders are unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations or increase their commitments under the credit facility. Due to these and other factors, we cannot be certain that funding, if needed, will be available to the extent required or on terms we find acceptable. If we are unable to access funding when needed on acceptable terms, we may not be able to fully implement our business plans, fund our capital program and commitments, complete new property acquisitions to replace reserves, take advantage of business opportunities, respond to competitive pressures, or refinance debt obligations as they come due. Should any of the above risks occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities.\nOur natural gas and oil exploration and production operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those governing environmental protection, the occupational health and safety aspects of our operations, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the protection of certain plant and animal species. See \u201cOther -Environmental Regulation\u201d in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report for a description of the laws and regulations that affect us. In order to conduct operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. Environmental regulations may restrict the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities, limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas, and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. In addition, we may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenues.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including investigatory actions, the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements, or the issuance of orders or judgments limiting or enjoining future operations. Strict liability or joint and several liability may be imposed under certain laws, which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions. Moreover, our costs of compliance with existing laws could be substantial and may increase or unforeseen liabilities could be imposed if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. If we are not able to recover the increased costs through insurance or increased revenues, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nClimate change legislation or regulations governing the emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduce demand for the natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids we produce.\nIn response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to human health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their greenhouse gas emissions also will be required to meet \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards that will be established on a case-by-case basis. One of our subsidiaries operates compressor stations, which are facilities that are required to adhere to the PSD or Title V permit requirements. EPA rulemakings related to greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources.\nThe EPA also has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified onshore and offshore natural gas and oil production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. More recently, in January 2015, the Obama Administration announced that the EPA is expected to finalize in 2016 new regulations that will set methane emission standards for new and modified natural gas and oil production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities as part of the Administration\u2019s efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and natural gas sector by up to 45% from 2012 levels by 2025. The EPA proposed such regulations in 2015.\nAlthough Congress from time to time has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of states, including states in which we operate, have enacted or passed measures to track and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs. Most of these cap-and-trade programs require major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal is achieved. These reductions may cause the cost of allowances to escalate significantly over time.\nThe adoption and implementation of regulations that require reporting of greenhouse gases or otherwise limit emissions of greenhouse gases from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to monitor and report on greenhouse gas emissions or install new equipment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations. In addition, these regulatory initiatives could drive down demand for our products by stimulating demand for alternative forms of energy that do not rely on combustion of fossil fuels that serve as a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. At the same time, new laws and regulations are prompting power producers to shift from coal to natural gas, which is increasing demand.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFurther, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. To the extent that the United States and other countries implement this agreement or impose other climate change regulations on the oil and natural gas industry, it could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe implementation of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives market and entities, including us, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC, the SEC, and other regulatory authorities to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. Although the CFTC has finalized most of its regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act, it continues to review and refine its initial rulemakings through additional interpretations and supplemental rulemakings. As a result, it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate effect of the rules and regulations on our business and while most of the regulations have been adopted, any new regulations or modifications to existing regulations may increase the cost of derivative contracts, limit the availability of derivatives to protect against risks that we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations thereunder, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures\nIn November 2013, the CFTC proposed new rules that would place federal limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. If finalized, the position limits rule and its companion rule on aggregation among entities under common ownership or control may have an impact on our ability to hedge our exposure to certain enumerated commodities.\nThe CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and mandatory trading on designated contract markets or swap execution facilities. The CFTC may designate additional classes of swaps as subject to the mandatory clearing requirement in the future, but has not yet proposed rules designating any other classes of swaps, including physical commodity swaps, for mandatory clearing. The CFTC and prudential banking regulators also recently adopted mandatory margin requirements on uncleared swaps between swap dealers and certain other counterparties. We expect to qualify for and rely upon an end-user exception from the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements for swaps entered to hedge our commercial risks. We will also qualify for an exception from the uncleared swaps margin requirements. However, the application of the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements and the uncleared swaps margin requirement to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may adversely affect the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging.\nOur proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are estimates. Any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated.\nAs described in more detail under \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Natural Gas and Oil Properties\u201d in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report, our reserve data represents the estimates of our reservoir engineers made under the supervision of our management, and our reserve estimates are audited each year by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., or NSAI, an independent petroleum engineering firm. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas, oil and NGLs that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as natural gas, oil and NGL prices. Additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Furthermore, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data.\nResults of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate. Accordingly, initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered, and such variances may be material. Any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas, oil and NGL reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month average natural gas, oil and NGL index prices, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate, holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties. Actual future prices and costs\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nmay differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate, and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general.\nDerivative transactions may limit our potential gains and involve other risks.\nTo manage our exposure to price risk, we currently, and may in the future, enter into derivative arrangements, utilizing commodity derivatives with respect to a portion of our future production. The goal of entering into such derivative agreements is to lock in prices so as to limit volatility and increase the predictability of cash flow. These transactions limit our potential gains if natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids prices rise above the price established by the hedge.\nIn addition, derivative transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:\n\u00b7\nour production is less than expected;\n\u00b7\nthe counterparties to our futures contracts fail to perform on their contract obligations; or\n\u00b7\nan event materially impacts natural gas, oil or NGL prices or the relationship between the hedged price index and the natural gas, oil or NGL sales price.\nWe cannot assure you that any derivative transaction we may enter into will adequately protect us from declines in the prices of natural gas, oil or natural gas liquids. Likewise, these transactions may limit our potential gains should prices of natural gas, oil or natural gas liquids rise. Where we choose not to engage in derivative transactions in the future, we may be more adversely affected by changes in natural gas, oil or natural gas liquids prices than our competitors who engage in derivative transactions. Lower natural gas, oil and NGL prices may also negatively impact our ability to enter into derivative contracts at favorable prices.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nThe elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies has been proposed in recent years by members of the U.S. Congress and by the President in his fiscal year 2016 budget proposal. These changes have included, among other proposals:\n\u00b7\nrepeal of the percentage depletion allowance for natural gas and oil properties;\n\u00b7\nelimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs;\n\u00b7\nelimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities; and\n\u00b7\nextension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures.\nIt is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted. The passage of these or any similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws to eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Canadian exploration and production activities are subject to different risks and uncertainties, different from or in addition to those we face in our U.S. operations.\nIn addition to the various risks associated with our U.S. operations, we are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our Canadian exploration and production activities, including risks related to increases in taxes and governmental royalties, changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies, restrictions on imports and exports, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract rights, environmental protection controls, environmental compliance requirements and laws pertaining to workers\u2019 health and safety. Consequently, our exploration, development and production activities in Canada could be substantially affected by factors beyond our control. In addition, the rights of aboriginal peoples, called First Nations in Canada, are not clear. Our operations in New Brunswick have been subject to local protests, causing several temporary interruptions to our exploration activities. In December 2014, New Brunswick\u2019s provincial government announced its intent to impose a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing in the province, and, on March 27, 2015, the provincial legislature approved enabling legislation. We have been granted an extension of our licenses. The provincial government has announced a list of conditions that must be met before the moratorium can be lifted, but because these conditions are subjective and the government has discretion whether to grant an extension, we cannot predict the duration of the moratorium\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nor whether it will continue beyond the expiration of the licenses, as their terms have been extended. Unless and until the moratorium is lifted, we will not be able to continue with our program in New Brunswick. If the licenses expire before the moratorium is lifted or we can complete our program, we may be required to write off our investment.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development and production activities. We depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure as well as cloud applications and services, to process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, communicate with employees and business associates, perform compliance reporting and in many other activities related to our business. Our business associates, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production, and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have also increased. Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business associates may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches, which could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or protected information, corruption of data or other disruptions of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period.\nA cyber attack involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business associates, could disrupt our business and negatively impact our operations in a variety of ways, including:\n\u00b7\nunauthorized access to seismic data, reserves information, strategic information, or other sensitive or proprietary information could have a negative impact on our ability to compete for natural gas and oil resources;\n\u00b7\nunauthorized access to personal identifying information of royalty owners, employees and vendors, which could expose us to allegations that we did not sufficiently protect that information;\n\u00b7\ndata corruption or operational disruption of production infrastructure could result in loss of production, or accidental discharge;\n\u00b7\na cyber attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions which could delay or halt our major development projects; and\n\u00b7\na cyber attack on a third party gathering, pipeline, or rail service provider could delay or prevent us from marketing our production, resulting in a loss of revenues.\nThese events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nTo date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks; however, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing, oil spills, and explosions of natural gas transmission lines, may lead to regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business.\nCommon stockholders will be diluted if additional shares are issued.\nIn January 2015, we issued 30.0 million shares of common stock and 34.5 million depositary shares representing the 1/20th interest in our 6.25% Series B Mandatory Preferred Stock, which will convert into a minimum of approximately 64 million or a maximum of 75 million shares of common stock by January 2018, to refinance a portion of the debt we incurred to purchase acreage in West Virginia and southwest Pennsylvania. We also issue restricted stock, options and performance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nshare units to our employees and directors as part of their compensation. In addition, we may issue additional shares of common stock, additional notes or other securities or debt convertible into common stock, to extend maturities or fund capital expenditures. If we issue additional shares of our common stock in the future, it may have a dilutive effect on our current outstanding stockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and under Delaware law may impede or discourage a takeover, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, protective provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws or the implementation by our board of directors of a stockholder rights plan that could deter a takeover.", "PERMNO": 63765, "SIC": 4923, "TIC": "SWN"}
