{"cik": "356130", "company": "EMC INSURANCE GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-08", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below is a description of risk factors related to the Company\u2019s business, provided to enable investors to assess, and be appropriately apprised of, certain risks and uncertainties the Company faces in conducting its business. An investor should carefully consider the risks described below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. The risks and uncertainties discussed below are also applicable to forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K and in other reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and in management presentations delivered and press releases issued by the Company. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nRisks Relating to the Company and Its Business\nThe Company\u2019s operations are integrated with those of Employers Mutual, the parent company, and potential and actual conflicts exist between the best interests of the Company\u2019s stockholders and the best interests of the policyholders of Employers Mutual.\nEmployers Mutual currently owns shares of the Company\u2019s common stock entitling it to cast approximately 57 percent of the aggregate votes eligible to be cast by the Company\u2019s stockholders at any meeting of stockholders. These holdings enable Employers Mutual to control the election of the Company\u2019s board of directors. In addition, one of the five members of the Company\u2019s board of directors is also a member of the board of directors of Employers Mutual. This director has a fiduciary duty to both the Company\u2019s stockholders and to the policyholders of Employers Mutual. The Company\u2019s executive officers hold the same positions with both Employers Mutual and the Company, and therefore also have a fiduciary duty to both the stockholders of the Company and to the policyholders of Employers Mutual. Certain potential and actual conflicts of interest arise from the Company\u2019s relationship with Employers Mutual and these competing fiduciary duties. Among these conflicts of interest are:\n\u2022\nthe Company and Employers Mutual must establish the relative participation interests of all the participating insurers in the pooling arrangement, along with other terms of the pooling agreement;\n\u2022\nthe Company and Employers Mutual must establish the terms of the quota share and excess of loss agreements between Employers Mutual and the Company\u2019s reinsurance subsidiary, and, beginning in 2016, the terms of the reinsurance contract between Employers Mutual and the Company's property and casualty insurance subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nthe Company and Employers Mutual must establish the terms (including the interest rate, which is reviewed every five years) of the surplus notes issued by the Company\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries to Employers Mutual;\n\u2022\nthe Company and Employers Mutual must establish the terms (including the interest rate) of any inter-company loans between Employers Mutual and any of the Company\u2019s insurance company subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nthe Company and Employers Mutual must make judgments about the allocation of expenses to the Company and its subsidiaries and to Employers Mutual\u2019s subsidiaries that do not participate in the pooling agreement; and\n\u2022\nthe Company may enter into other transactions and contractual relationships with Employers Mutual and its subsidiaries or affiliates.\nAs a consequence, the Company and Employers Mutual have each established an Inter-Company Committee, with the Company\u2019s Inter-Company Committee consisting of three of the Company\u2019s independent directors who are not directors of Employers Mutual and Employers Mutual\u2019s Inter-Company Committee consisting of three directors of Employers Mutual who are not members of the Company\u2019s board of directors. Any new material agreement or transaction between Employers Mutual and the Company, as well as any proposed material change to an existing material agreement between Employers Mutual and the Company, must receive the approval of both Inter-Company Committees. This approval is granted only if the members of the Company\u2019s Inter-Company Committee unanimously conclude that the new agreement or transaction, or proposed material change to an existing agreement, is fair and reasonable to the Company and its stockholders, and the members of Employers Mutual\u2019s Inter-Company Committee unanimously conclude that the new agreement or transaction, or proposed change to an existing agreement, is fair and reasonable to Employers Mutual and its policyholders.\nThe Company relies on Employers Mutual to provide employees, facilities and information technology systems to conduct its operations.\nThe Company does not employ any staff to conduct its operations, nor does the Company own or, with one exception, lease any facilities or information technology systems necessary for its operations. As a result, the Company is totally dependent on Employers Mutual\u2019s employees, facilities and information technology systems to conduct its business. There are no agreements in place that obligate Employers Mutual to provide the Company with access to its employees, facilities or information technology systems. In addition, the Company does not have any employment agreements with its executive officers, all of whom are employed by Employers Mutual. These arrangements make it unlikely that anyone could acquire control of the Company or replace its management unless Employers Mutual was in favor of such action. Any of these arrangements could diminish the value of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations could suffer if the pool participants were to forecast future losses inaccurately, experience unusually severe or frequent losses or inadequately price their insurance products.\nThe Company\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries participate in a pooling agreement under which they share the underwriting results of the property and casualty insurance business written by all the pool participants (excluding certain assumed reinsurance business). Because of the pooled business the Company is allocated, the insurance operations of the Company\u2019s pool participants are integrated with the insurance operations of the Employers Mutual pool participants, and the Company\u2019s results of operations depend upon the forecasts, pricing and underwriting results of the Employers Mutual pool participants. Although the pool is intended to produce a more uniform and stable underwriting result from year to year for the participants than they would experience separately by spreading the risk of losses among the participants, if any of the pool participants experience unusually severe or frequent losses or do not adequately price their insurance products, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer.\nOne of the distinguishing features of the property and casualty insurance industry is that its products are priced before the costs are known, as premium rates are generally determined before losses are reported. Accordingly, the pool participants must establish premium rates from forecasts of the ultimate costs they expect to incur from risks underwritten during the policy period, and premiums may not be adequate to cover the ultimate losses incurred. Further, the pool participants must establish reserves for losses and settlement expenses based upon estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections of expected ultimate liability at a given time, and it is possible that the ultimate liability will exceed these estimates because of the future development of known losses, the existence of losses that have occurred but are currently unreported, or larger than expected settlements on pending and unreported claims. Prior to the end of each quarter, Employers Mutual\u2019s actuaries review the adequacy of the pool's previous quarter's reserves for the various lines of business underwritten and these reviews have in the past, and may in the future, indicate that additional reserves are necessary to adequately cover anticipated losses and settlement expenses. The process of estimating reserves is inherently judgmental and can be influenced by factors that are subject to variation. If the premium rates or reserves established are not sufficient, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and/or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nAn increase in asbestos and environmental claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company has exposure to asbestos and environmental claims arising from the other liability line of business written by the parties to the pooling agreement, as well as the pro rata and excess of loss business assumed by the reinsurance subsidiary. These exposures are closely monitored by management and reserves have been established to cover estimated ultimate losses. Estimating loss and settlement expense reserves for asbestos and environmental claims is very difficult due to the many uncertainties surrounding these types of claims, such as whether coverage exists, the definition of an occurrence, determination of ultimate damages and the assignment of damages to the responsible parties. These uncertainties are compounded by the fact that claims typically emerge long after a policy has expired. It is possible that the ultimate liability for these exposures may increase significantly as a result of the settlement of lawsuits or the receipt of additional claims, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and/or results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business may not continue to grow and may be adversely affected if it cannot retain existing, and attract new, independent agents, or if insurance consumers increase their use of other insurance delivery systems.\nThe continued growth of the Company\u2019s business will depend upon the pool participants\u2019 ability to retain existing, and attract new, independent agents. The pool participants\u2019 agency force is one of the most important components of their competitive position. To the extent that the pool participants\u2019 existing agents cannot maintain current levels of production, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations will suffer. Moreover, if independent agencies find it easier to do business with the pool participants\u2019 competitors, it could be difficult for them to retain their existing business or attract new business. While the pool participants believe they maintain good relationships with their independent agents, they cannot be certain that these independent agents will continue to sell their products to the consumers they represent. Some of the factors that could adversely affect the ability to retain existing, and attract new, independent agents include:\n\u2022\ncompetition in the insurance industry to attract independent agents;\n\u2022\nthe pool participants\u2019 requirement that independent agents adhere to disciplined underwriting standards; and\n\u2022\nthe pool participants\u2019 ability to pay competitive and attractive commissions, profit share bonuses and other incentives to independent agents as compensation for selling their products.\nWhile the pool participants sell substantially all their insurance through their network of independent agents, many of their competitors sell insurance through a variety of other delivery methods, including captive agencies, the internet and direct sales. To the extent that businesses and individuals represented by the pool participants\u2019 independent agents change their delivery system preferences, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe failure of the pool participants to maintain their current financial strength rating could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and competitive position.\nThe pool participants, including the Company\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries, are currently rated \u201cA\u201d (Excellent) by A.M. Best, an industry-accepted source of property and casualty insurance company financial strength ratings. A.M. Best ratings are specifically designed to provide an independent opinion of an insurance company\u2019s financial health and its ability to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders. These ratings are directed toward the protection of policyholders, not investors. If the ratings of the pool participants were to be downgraded (particularly below \"A-\") by A.M. Best, it would adversely affect the Company\u2019s competitive position and make it more difficult for it to market its products, and retain its existing agents and policyholders. A downgrade of Employers Mutual's rating below \"A-\" could make it ineligible to assume certain reinsurance business, which could lead to a reduction in the amount of business ceded to the Company's reinsurance subsidiary under the quota share agreement. Thus, a downgrade in the pool participants\u2019 (including Employers Mutual\u2019s) A.M. Best ratings below \"A-\" would likely result in a material reduction in the amount of the Company\u2019s business.\nThe insolvency of Employers Mutual or one of its subsidiaries or affiliate could result in additional liabilities for the Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries participating in the pooling agreement.\nThe pooling agreement requires each pool participant to assume its pro rata share (based on its participation interest in the pool) of the liabilities of any pool participant that becomes insolvent or is otherwise subject to liquidation or receivership proceedings. Under this provision, the Company\u2019s pool participants could become financially responsible for their pro rata share of the liabilities of one or more of the Employers Mutual pool participants in the event of an insolvency, or a liquidation or receivership proceeding involving such participant(s).\nThe Company is dependent on dividends from its subsidiaries for the payment of its operating expenses and dividends to stockholders; however, its subsidiaries may be unable to pay dividends to the Company.\nAs a holding company, the Company relies primarily on dividends from its subsidiaries as a source of funds to meet its corporate obligations and pay dividends to its stockholders. Payment of dividends by the Company\u2019s subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions, and depends on the surplus position of its subsidiaries. The maximum amount of dividends that the Company\u2019s subsidiaries can pay it in 2016 without prior regulatory approval is approximately $49.8 million. In addition, state insurance regulators have broad discretion to limit the payment of dividends by the Company\u2019s subsidiaries in the future. The ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to it may be further constrained by business and regulatory considerations, such as the impact of dividends on surplus, competitive position and the amount of premiums that can be written.\nThe Company\u2019s investment portfolio is subject to economic loss, principally from changes in the market value of financial instruments.\nThe Company had fixed maturity investments with a fair value of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2015 that are subject to:\n\u2022\nmarket risk, which is the risk that the Company\u2019s invested assets will decrease in value due to:\n\u2022\nan increase in interest rates or a change in the prevailing market yields on its investments,\n\u2022\nan unfavorable change in the liquidity of an investment, or\n\u2022\nan unfavorable change in the financial prospects, or a downgrade in the credit rating, of the issuer of an investment;\n\u2022\nreinvestment risk, which is the risk that interest rates will decline and funds reinvested will earn less investment income than previously earned; and\n\u2022\nliquidity risk, which is the risk that the Company may have to sell assets at an undesirable time and/or price to provide cash for the payment of claims.\nThe Company maintains a well diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities in an attempt to manage market, reinvestment and liquidity risk. The Company primarily pursues a buy and hold strategy for fixed maturity investments. Fixed maturity securities are purchased as new funds become available to the portfolio. This strategy has a laddering effect on portfolio maturities that mitigates some of the effects of adverse interest rate movements.\nThe Company\u2019s fixed maturity investment portfolio includes mortgage-backed securities. As of December 31, 2015, mortgage-backed securities constituted approximately 12.3 percent of the fixed maturity portfolio. As with other fixed maturity investments, the fair value of these securities fluctuates depending on market and other general economic conditions and the interest rate environment. Changes in interest rates can expose the Company to prepayment risks on these investments. In periods of declining interest rates, mortgage prepayments generally increase and mortgage-backed securities are paid more quickly, requiring the Company to reinvest the proceeds at the then current market rates.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock equity portfolio, with a fair value of $187.2 million as of December 31, 2015, is subject to economic loss from a decline in market prices. The Company invests in publicly traded companies listed in the United States with large market capitalizations. An adverse development in the stock market, or one or more securities that the Company invests in, could adversely affect its capital position. The Company is currently invested in a limited partnership that is designed to help protect the Company from significant monthly downside price volatility in the equity markets. However, this type of protection may be discontinued in the future depending on market conditions and/or the cost of the protection.\nThe success of any investment activity is affected by general economic conditions, which may adversely affect the markets for fixed maturity and equity securities. Unexpected volatility or illiquidity in the markets in which the Company holds securities could reduce its liquidity and stockholders\u2019 equity. To mitigate these risks, the Company\u2019s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are able to borrow funds on a short-term basis from Employers Mutual and its subsidiaries and affiliate under an Inter-Company Loan Agreement.\nChanges in key assumptions or a deterioration in the debt and equity markets could lead to an increase in Employers Mutual\u2019s employee benefit plans' costs and a decline in the funded status, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and/or results of operations.\nEmployers Mutual's employee benefit plans' costs and funded status reflect the use of key assumptions regarding the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of future compensation increases (pension plans only). Changes in these assumptions could result in a significant decrease in the plans\u2019 funded status and increase the future net periodic costs associated with these plans. In addition, large declines in the fair value of the assets held in the plans could result in a significant decrease in the plans\u2019 funded status and increase the future net periodic costs associated with these plans. A decrease to the plans' funded status could require Employers Mutual to make significant contributions to its employee benefit plans to maintain adequate funding levels, and the Company would be responsible for its share of these contributions under the pooling agreement. The occurrence of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and/or results of operations.\nThe pool participants currently conduct business in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, with a concentration of business in the Midwest. The occurrence of catastrophes, or other conditions affecting losses in this region, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn 2015, 69 percent of the pool participant\u2019s direct premiums written were generated through ten Midwest branch offices, with 13 percent of the direct premiums written generated in Iowa. While the pool participants actively manage their exposure to catastrophes through their underwriting process and the purchase of third-party reinsurance, a single catastrophic occurrence, destructive weather pattern, changing climate conditions, general economic trend, terrorist attack, regulatory development or any other condition affecting the states in which the pool participants conduct substantial business could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, the Company\u2019s revenues and profitability are affected by the prevailing regulatory, economic, demographic, competitive and other conditions in these states. Changes in any of these conditions could make it more costly or more difficult for the pool participants to conduct their business. Adverse regulatory developments in these states could include reductions in the maximum rates permitted to be charged, restrictions on rate increases, or fundamental changes to the design or operation of the regulatory framework, and any of these could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company cannot predict the impact that changing climate conditions, including legal, regulatory, and social responses thereto, may have on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSome scientists, environmentalists, and other experts believe that changing climate conditions have added to the unpredictability, frequency, and severity of weather-related losses. If climate conditions are changing and affecting weather patterns, the Company could experience additional losses from catastrophic events and destructive weather patterns. The Company cannot predict the impact that changing climate conditions, if any, will have on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. It is also possible that legal, regulatory and social responses to climate change could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe frequency and severity of significant catastrophe and storm activity could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company's insurance operations expose the Company to claims arising out of catastrophic events. Common catastrophic events include tornadoes, wind and hail storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, explosions and severe winter storms. If changing climate conditions result in an increase in the frequency and severity of weather-related losses, the Company could experience additional losses from catastrophic events and destructive weather patterns. High levels of catastrophe and storm losses could lead to changes in the reinsurance programs protecting the Company (including the reinsurance coverage provided by Employers Mutual to the Company\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries and reinsurance subsidiary). These changes could include increases in the amount of losses retained, increased pricing and, for the pool participants, decreased availability of catastrophe reinsurance protection. Examples of such changes include increases in the pool participants\u2019 retention amounts on ceded contracts covering the pool business, and increases in the amount of losses retained by the reinsurance subsidiary. Future increases in the cost of reinsurance protection, and/or the amount of catastrophe and storm losses retained, could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nLosses related to a terrorist attack could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks could cause significant losses from insurance claims related to the property and casualty insurance operations of the pool participants and the reinsurance operations of the Company\u2019s reinsurance subsidiary, and have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. The TRIA Reauthorization Act requires that some coverage for terrorism losses be offered by primary property and casualty insurers, and provides federal assistance for recovery of a portion of claims incurred (effective through December 31, 2020). While the pool participants are protected by this federally funded terrorism reinsurance with respect to claims under most commercial insurance products, the pool participants are prohibited from adding terrorism exclusions to the commercial lines policies they write, and a substantial deductible must be met before the TRIA Reauthorization Act provides coverage to the pool. The pool participants\u2019 personal lines products do not provide terrorism coverage. The pool participants have underlying reinsurance coverage to partially cover the TRIA Reauthorization Act deductible, but the Company can offer no assurances that the threats or actual occurrence of future terrorist-like events in the United States and abroad, or military actions by the United States, will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe profitability of the Company\u2019s reinsurance subsidiary is dependent upon the experience of Employers Mutual, and changes to this relationship may adversely affect the reinsurance subsidiary\u2019s operations.\nThe Company\u2019s reinsurance subsidiary operates under a quota share reinsurance agreement with Employers Mutual, which generated 21 percent of the Company\u2019s net premiums earned in 2015. Under the quota share reinsurance agreement, the reinsurance subsidiary assumes the voluntary reinsurance business written directly by Employers Mutual (subject to certain limited exceptions). The reinsurance subsidiary also has an excess of loss agreement with Employers Mutual, which is being modified for 2016. The reinsurance subsidiary primarily relies on these agreements and on Employers Mutual for its business. If Employers Mutual terminates or otherwise seeks to modify these agreements, the reinsurance subsidiary may not be able to enter into similar arrangements with other companies and may be adversely affected.\nThrough the quota share reinsurance agreement, the reinsurance subsidiary assumes the voluntary reinsurance business written directly by Employers Mutual with unaffiliated insurance companies, and the reinsurance business assumed by Employers Mutual from MRB, a voluntary underwriting association of property and casualty insurers in which Employers Mutual participates. If Employers Mutual or the other participants of MRB discontinue or reduce the assumption of property and casualty risks, the reinsurance subsidiary could be adversely affected. In connection with the risks assumed from MRB, officers of the reinsurance subsidiary and Employers Mutual have reviewed the relevant underwriting policies and procedures, however, no officer of the reinsurance subsidiary directly reviews such risks assumed at the time of underwriting. If Employers Mutual or MRB are unable to sell reinsurance at adequate premium rates, or were to have poor underwriting experience, the reinsurance subsidiary could be adversely affected. In addition, since MRB is structured on a joint liability basis, Employers Mutual, and therefore the Company\u2019s reinsurance subsidiary, would be obligated with respect to the proportionate share of risks assumed by the other participants in the event they were unable to perform. The failure of the other MRB participants to perform could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company may not be successful in reducing its risks and increasing its underwriting capacity through reinsurance arrangements, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn order to reduce underwriting risk and increase underwriting capacity, the pool participants transfer portions of the pool\u2019s insurance risk to other insurers through reinsurance contracts. The availability, cost and structure of reinsurance protection is subject to changing market conditions that are outside of the pool participants\u2019 control. In order for these contracts to qualify for reinsurance accounting and thereby provide the additional underwriting capacity that the pool participants desire, the reinsurer generally must assume significant risk and have a reasonable possibility of a significant loss.\nThe reinsurance subsidiary assumes and cedes some selected reinsurance business through the quota share agreement in connection with \u201cfronting\u201d activities initiated by Employers Mutual. Under these arrangements, an agreed upon percentage of the selected assumed business is ceded to other reinsurer(s) on a pro rata basis.\nAlthough the reinsurers are liable to the extent they assume risk, the Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries remain ultimately liable on all risks reinsured. As a result, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not limit the ultimate obligation to pay claims. The Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are subject to the credit risks of their reinsurers. They are also subject to the risk that their reinsurers may dispute obligations to pay their claims. As a result, the Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries may not recover on claims made against their reinsurers in a timely manner, if at all, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business is highly cyclical and competitive, which may make it difficult for it to market its products effectively and profitably.\nThe property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical and competitive, and individual lines of business experience their own cycles within the overall insurance industry cycle. Premium rate levels are subject to many variables, including the availability of insurance coverage, which can vary according to the level of capital within the industry. Increases in industry capital have generally been accompanied by increased price competition. If the pool participants find it necessary to reduce premiums or limit premium increases due to these competitive pressures on pricing, the Company may experience a reduction in its profit margins and revenues and, therefore, lower profitability.\nThe pool participants compete with insurers that sell insurance policies through independent agents and/or directly to their customers. These competitors are not only national companies, but also insurers and independent agents that operate in a specific region or a single state. Some of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than the pool participants, and may offer a broader range of products or offer competing products at lower prices. The Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by a loss of business to its competitors.\nThe reinsurance business is also highly cyclical and competitive. Employers Mutual, in writing reinsurance business through its HORAD operation, competes in the global reinsurance market with numerous reinsurance companies, many of which have substantially greater financial resources. Competition for reinsurance business is based on many factors, including the perceived financial strength of the reinsurer, industry ratings, stability in products offered and licensing status. There is a segment of the market that favors large, highly-capitalized reinsurance companies who are able to provide \u201cmega\u201d line capacity for multiple lines of business. Employers Mutual faces the risk of ceding companies becoming less interested in diversity and spread of reinsurance risk in favor of having fewer, highly-capitalized reinsurance companies on their program. If Employers Mutual loses reinsurance business to its competitors, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nNew pricing, claims, coverage issues, class action litigation, and technology innovations are continually emerging in the property and casualty insurance industry, and these new issues could adversely impact the Company\u2019s revenues or its methods of doing business.\nAs property and casualty insurance industry practices, and regulatory, judicial and consumer conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims, coverages and business practices may emerge. These issues could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business by changing the way the pool participants price their products, by extending coverages beyond their underwriting intent, or by increasing the size of claims. The effect of unforeseen emerging issues could negatively affect the Company\u2019s results of operations or its methods of doing business. In addition, the advent of driverless cars and usage-based insurance could materially alter the way that automobile insurance is marketed, priced, and underwritten.\nThe Company is subject to comprehensive regulation that may restrict its ability to earn profits.\nThe Company is subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by the insurance departments in the states where its subsidiaries are domiciled and where its subsidiaries and the other pool participants sell insurance products, issue policies and handle claims. Certain regulatory restrictions and prior approval requirements may affect the pool participants\u2019 ability to operate, compete, innovate or obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner, and may also increase their costs and reduce profitability.\nSupervision and regulation by insurance departments extend, among other things, to:\nRequired Licensing. The pool participants operate under licenses issued by various state insurance departments. These licenses govern, among other things, the types of insurance coverages, agency and claims services, and products that the pool participants may offer consumers in the states in which they operate. The pool participants must apply for and obtain appropriate licenses before they can implement any plan to expand into a new state or offer a new line of insurance or other new products that require separate licensing. If a regulatory authority denies or delays granting a new license, the pool participants\u2019 ability to enter new markets quickly or offer new products they believe will be profitable can be substantially impaired.\nRegulation of Premium Rates and Approval of Policy Forms. The insurance laws of most states in which the pool participants operate require insurance companies to file premium rate schedules and insurance policy forms for review and approval. State insurance departments have broad discretion in judging whether the pool participants\u2019 rates are adequate, not excessive and not unfairly discriminatory. The speed at which the pool participants can change their rates in response to competition or increased costs depends, in part, on the method by which the applicable state\u2019s rating laws are administered. Generally, state insurance departments have the authority to disapprove the pool participants\u2019 requested rates. Thus, if the pool participants begin using new rates before they are approved, as permitted in some states, they may be required to issue premium refunds or credits to their policyholders if the new rates are ultimately deemed excessive or unfair, and are disapproved by the applicable state department. In addition, in some states, there has been pressure in past years to reduce premium rates for automobile and other personal insurance, or to limit how often an insurer may request increases for such rates. In states where such pressure is applied, the pool participants\u2019 ability to respond to market developments or increased costs can be adversely affected.\nRestrictions on Cancellation, Non-Renewal or Withdrawal. Many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer\u2019s ability to exit a market. Some states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing from one or more lines of business in the state, except pursuant to a plan approved by the state insurance department. A state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead, under its analyses, to market disruption. These laws and regulations could limit the pool participants\u2019 ability to exit unprofitable markets or discontinue unprofitable products in the future.\nInvestment Restrictions. The Company\u2019s subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of their investment portfolios, and that limit the amount of investments in certain categories. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause nonconforming investments to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some instances, would require divestiture.\nOther Regulations. The Company must also comply with laws and regulations involving, among other things:\n\u2022\ndisclosure, and in some cases prior approval, of transactions between members of an insurance holding company system;\n\u2022\nacquisition or disposition of an insurance company, or of any company controlling an insurance company;\n\u2022\ninvoluntary assignments of high-risk policies, participation in reinsurance facilities and underwriting associations, and assessments and other governmental charges;\n\u2022\nuse of non-public consumer information and related privacy issues; and\n\u2022\nuse of credit history in underwriting and rating.\nThese laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company cannot provide any assurance that states will not make existing insurance laws and regulations more restrictive in the future, or enact new restrictive laws.\nFrom time to time, the United States Congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. The Company closely monitors the activities of the United States Congress and federal agencies through its membership in various organizations. In particular, our trade organizations are working to monitor and ensure appropriate implementation of the federal terrorism risk insurance program, to shape the activities of the Federal Insurance Office as it continues to evolve and exercise its authority to monitor the insurance industry, to pass appropriate tax reform legislation, and to extend the judicial relief from the remand to an exemption for property and hazard and homeowners insurance from application of the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Disparate Impact Rule. The Company is unable to predict whether, or to what extent, new laws and regulations that could affect its business will be adopted in the future, the timing of any such adoption and what effects, if any, they may have on its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges to existing accounting standards may adversely affect the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company is required to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, as promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"), subject to accounting rules and interpretations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, the Company is required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by these authoritative bodies from time to time. It is possible that changes to the Company\u2019s accounting policies resulting from the adoption of future changes in GAAP, including an updated financial instruments standard issued in January 2016 and a new lease accounting standard issued in February 2016, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s reported financial condition and/or results of operations. The Company's significant accounting policies are described in note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company relies on Employer Mutual\u2019s information technology and telecommunication systems, and the disruption or failure of these systems, or the compromise of the security of the systems that results in the misuse of confidential information, could materially and adversely affect its business.\nThe Company\u2019s business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of Employers Mutual\u2019s information technology and telecommunications systems. The Company relies on the capacity, reliability and security of these systems to process new and renewal business, provide customer service, process and pay claims, and facilitate collections and cancellations. These systems also enable the performance of actuarial and other modeling functions necessary for underwriting and rate development and establishing and evaluating reserves. Despite security measures in place, the information technology systems could be vulnerable to computer malware or viruses, unauthorized access, or other cyber attacks that could disrupt the systems. The failure or disruption of these systems could interrupt the Company\u2019s operations through reduced ability to underwrite and process new and renewal business, pay claims in a timely manner and provide customer service.\nA security breach of information technology systems that results in the misuse or misappropriation of confidential information could expose Employers Mutual to litigation, or damage Employers Mutual\u2019s reputation. Any legal or other expenses resulting from the misuse of confidential information would be shared by all users of the systems, including the Company and its subsidiaries, and such losses could be significant.\nAlthough Employers Mutual maintains insurance on its real property and other physical assets, this insurance will not compensate Employers Mutual for losses that may occur due to disruptions in service as a result of a computer, data processing or telecommunication systems failure unrelated to covered property damage. Also, this insurance may not necessarily compensate Employers Mutual for all losses resulting from covered events. Employers Mutual retains the risks from disruptions in computer processing and telecommunications services, and has implemented a variety of controls to mitigate these risks including, but not limited to, off-site back-up and redundant processing capabilities, access restrictions to confidential customer data, and documented plans for resuming operations upon the occurrence of an event. A portion of any losses resulting from the failure or disruption of Employers Mutual\u2019s information technology and telecommunication systems would be shared by all users of the systems, including the Company and its subsidiaries, and such losses could be significant.\nRisks Relating to the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nEmployers Mutual has the ability to determine the outcome of all matters submitted to the Company\u2019s stockholders for approval. The price of the Company\u2019s common stock may be adversely affected because of Employers Mutual\u2019s majority ownership of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock has one vote per share and voting control of the Company is currently vested in Employers Mutual, which owns approximately 57 percent of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock. Employers Mutual must retain a minimum 50.1 percent ownership of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock at all times in order for the pool participants to have their A.M. Best financial strength ratings determined on a \u201cgroup\u201d basis. Accordingly, Employers Mutual will retain the ability to control:\n\u2022\nthe election of the Company\u2019s entire board of directors, which in turn determines its management and policies;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to the Company\u2019s stockholders for approval, including mergers or other transactions providing for a change of control; and\n\u2022\nthe amendment of the Company\u2019s organizational documents.\nThe interests of Employers Mutual may conflict with the interests of the Company\u2019s other stockholders and may have a negative effect on the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nEmployers Mutual\u2019s ownership of the Company\u2019s common stock and provisions of certain state laws make it unlikely anyone could acquire control of the Company or replace or remove its management unless Employers Mutual were in favor of such action, which could diminish the value of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nEmployers Mutual\u2019s ownership of the Company\u2019s common stock and the laws and regulations of Iowa and North Dakota could delay, or prevent, the removal of members of its board of directors, and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving the Company more difficult to complete, even if such events were beneficial to the interest of its stockholders other than Employers Mutual. The insurance laws of the states in which the Company\u2019 subsidiaries are domiciled prohibit any person from acquiring control of it, and thus indirect control of its subsidiaries, without the prior approval of each such state insurance department. Generally, these laws presume that control exists where any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10 percent or more of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock. Even persons who do not acquire beneficial ownership of 10 percent or more of the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock may be deemed to have acquired such control, if the relevant insurance department determines that such control exists in fact. Therefore, any person seeking to acquire a controlling interest in the Company would face regulatory obstacles, which could delay, deter or prevent an acquisition that stockholders might consider to be in their best interests. Moreover, the Iowa Business Corporation Act, which governs the Company\u2019s corporate activities, contains certain provisions that prohibit certain business combination transactions under certain circumstances. These factors could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of the Company and thus could have a negative impact on the value of the Company's common stock.\nAlthough the Company has consistently paid cash dividends in the past, it may not be able to pay cash dividends in the future.\nThe Company has paid cash dividends to its stockholders on a consistent basis since 1982, following the initial public offering of its common stock. However, future cash dividends will depend upon various factors, including the ability of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries to make distributions to it, which may be restricted by financial or regulatory constraints. Also, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to pay dividends even if the necessary financial and regulatory conditions are met and if sufficient cash is available for distribution.", "PERMNO": 31238, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "EMCI"}
