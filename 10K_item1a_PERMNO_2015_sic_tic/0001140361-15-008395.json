{"cik": "56047", "company": "KIRBY CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors should be considered carefully when evaluating the Company, as its businesses, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The following discussion does not attempt to cover factors, such as trends in the United States and global economies or the level of interest rates, among others, that are likely to affect most businesses.\nThe Inland Waterway infrastructure is aging and may result in increased costs and disruptions to the Company\u2019s marine transportation segment. Maintenance of the United States inland waterway system is vital to the Company\u2019s operations. The system is composed of over 12,000 miles of commercially navigable waterway, supported by over 240 locks and dams designed to provide flood control, maintain pool levels of water in certain areas of the country and facilitate navigation on the inland river system. The United States inland waterway infrastructure is aging, with more than half of the locks over 50 years old. As a result, due to the age of the locks, scheduled and unscheduled maintenance outages may be more frequent in nature, resulting in delays and additional operating expenses. One-half of the cost of new construction and major rehabilitation of locks and dams is paid by marine transportation companies through a 20 cent per gallon diesel fuel tax and the remaining 50% is paid from general federal tax revenues. Effective April 1, 2015, the diesel fuel tax paid by marine transportation companies increases to 29 cents per gallon. Failure of the federal government to adequately fund infrastructure maintenance and improvements in the future would have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products for its customers on a timely basis. In addition, any additional user taxes that may be imposed in the future to fund infrastructure improvements would increase the Company\u2019s operating expenses.\nThe Company is subject to adverse weather conditions in its marine transportation and diesel engine services segments. The Company\u2019s marine transportation segment is subject to weather conditions on a daily basis. Adverse weather conditions such as high or low water on the inland waterway systems, fog and ice, tropical storms, hurricanes and tsunamis on both the inland waterway systems and throughout the United States coastal waters can impair the operating efficiencies of the marine fleet. Such adverse weather conditions can cause a delay, diversion or postponement of shipments of products and are totally beyond the control of the Company. In addition, adverse water and weather conditions can negatively affect a towing vessel\u2019s performance, tow size, loading drafts, fleet efficiency, place limitations on night passages and dictate horsepower requirements. The Company\u2019s diesel engine services segment is subject to tropical storms and hurricanes impacting its coastal locations and tornadoes impacting its Oklahoma facilities.\nThe Company could be adversely impacted by a marine accident or spill event. A marine accident or spill event could close a portion of the inland waterway system or a coastal area of the United States for a period of time. Although statistically marine transportation is the safest means of transporting bulk commodities, accidents do occur, both involving Company equipment and equipment owned by other marine carriers.\nThe Company transports a wide variety of petrochemicals, black oil, refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals throughout the Mississippi River System, the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, coastwise along all three United States coasts and in Alaska and Hawaii. The Company manages its exposure to losses from potential discharges of pollutants through the use of well-maintained and equipped tank barges and towing vessels, through safety, training and environmental programs, and through the Company\u2019s insurance program, but a discharge of pollutants by the Company could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s marine transportation segment is dependent on its ability to adequately crew its towing vessels. The Company\u2019s towing vessels are crewed with employees who are licensed or certified by the USCG, including its captains, pilots, engineers and tankermen. The success of the Company\u2019s marine transportation segment is dependent on the Company\u2019s ability to adequately crew its towing vessels. As a result, the Company invests significant resources in training its crews and providing crew members an opportunity to advance from a deckhand to the captain of a Company towboat or tugboat, or on the coastal tugboats from a deckhand to the chief engineer. Lifestyle issues are a deterrent for employment for inland and coastal crew members. Inland crew members generally work a 20 days on, 10 days off rotation, or a 30 days on, 15 days off rotation. For the coastal fleet, crew members are generally required to work a 14 days on, 14 days off, 21 days on, 21 days off or 30 days on, 30 days off rotation, dependent upon the location. With ongoing retirements and competitive labor pressure in the marine transportation segment, the Company continues to monitor and implement market competitive pay practices. The Company also utilizes an internal development program to train Maritime Academy graduates for vessel leadership positions.\nThe Company\u2019s marine transportation segment has approximately 3,275 employees, of which approximately 2,450 are vessel crew members. None of the segment\u2019s inland operations are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The segment\u2019s coastal operation includes approximately 900 vessel employees, of whom approximately 550 are subject to collective bargaining agreements in certain geographic areas. Any work stoppages or labor disputes could adversely affect coastal operations in those areas.\nReduction in the number of acquisitions made by the Company may curtail future growth. Since 1986, the Company has been successful in the integration of 31 acquisitions in its marine transportation segment and 17 acquisitions in its diesel engine services segment. Acquisitions have played a significant part in the growth of the Company. The Company\u2019s marine transportation revenue in 1987 was $40.2 million compared with $1.8 billion in 2014. Diesel engine services revenue in 1987 was $7.1 million compared with $795.6 million in 2014. While the Company is of the opinion that future acquisition opportunities exist in both its marine transportation and diesel engine services segments, the Company may not be able to continue to grow through acquisitions to the extent that it has in the past.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) could have a negative impact on its ongoing operations. The Company\u2019s operations outside the United States require the Company to comply with a number of United States and international regulations. For example, its operations in countries outside the United States are subject to the FCPA, which prohibits United States companies or their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business, direct business to any person or corporate entity, or obtain any unfair advantage. The Company has internal control policies and procedures and has implemented training and compliance programs for its employees and agents with respect to the FCPA. However, the Company\u2019s policies, procedures and programs may not always protect it from reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees or agents, and severe criminal or civil sanctions could be the result of violations of the FCPA. The Company is also subject to the risks that its employees, joint venture partners, and agents outside of the United States may fail to comply with other applicable laws.\nThe Company\u2019s marine transportation segment is subject to the Jones Act. The Company\u2019s marine transportation segment competes principally in markets subject to the Jones Act, a federal cabotage law that restricts domestic marine transportation in the United States to vessels built and registered in the United States, and manned and owned by United States citizens. The Company presently meets all of the requirements of the Jones Act for its vessels. The loss of Jones Act status could have a significant negative effect on the Company. The requirements that the Company\u2019s vessels be United States built and manned by United States citizens, the crewing requirements and material requirements of the USCG, and the application of United States labor and tax laws increases the cost of United States flag vessels when compared with comparable foreign flag vessels. The Company\u2019s business could be adversely affected if the Jones Act were to be modified so as to permit foreign competition that is not subject to the same United States government imposed burdens. Since the events of September 11, 2001, the United States government has taken steps to increase security of United States ports, coastal waters and inland waterways. The Company feels that it is unlikely that the current cabotage provisions of the Jones Act would be modified or eliminated in the foreseeable future.\nThe Secretary of Homeland Security is vested with the authority and discretion to waive the Jones Act to such extent and upon such terms as the Secretary may prescribe whenever the Secretary deems that such action is necessary in the interest of national defense. In response to the effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the Secretary waived the Jones Act generally for the transportation of petroleum products from September 1 to September 19, 2005 and from September 26, 2005 to October 24, 2005. In June 2011, the Secretary waived the Jones Act for the transportation of petroleum released from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and in November 2012 waived the Jones Act for the transportation of refined petroleum products in the Northeast following Hurricane Sandy. Waivers of the Jones Act, whether in response to natural disasters or otherwise, could result in increased competition from foreign tank vessel operators, which could negatively impact the marine transportation segment.\nThe Company\u2019s marine transportation segment is subject to regulation by the USCG, federal laws, state laws and certain international conventions, as well as numerous environmental regulations. The majority of the Company\u2019s vessels are subject to inspection by the USCG and carry certificates of inspection. The crews employed by the Company aboard vessels are licensed or certified by the USCG. The Company is required by various governmental agencies to obtain licenses, certificates and permits for its vessels. The Company\u2019s operations are also affected by various United States and state regulations and legislation enacted for protection of the environment. The Company incurs significant expenses to comply with applicable laws and regulations and any significant new regulation or legislation, including climate change laws or regulations, could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with possible climate change legislation, regulation and international accords. Greenhouse gas emissions have increasingly become the subject of a large amount of international, national, regional, state and local attention. On December 7, 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) furthered its focus on greenhouse gas emissions when it issued its endangerment finding in response to a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States. The EPA found that the emission of six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (which is emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels), may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare. Based on this finding, the EPA defined the mix of these six greenhouse gases to be \u201cair pollution\u201d subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act. Although the EPA has stated a preference that greenhouse gas regulation be based on new federal legislation rather than the existing Clean Air Act, many sources of greenhouse gas emissions may be regulated without the need for further legislation.\nThe United States Congress has considered in the past legislation that would create an economy-wide \u201ccap-and-trade\u201d system that would establish a limit (or cap) on overall greenhouse gas emissions and create a market for the purchase and sale of emissions permits or \u201callowances.\u201d Any proposed cap-and-trade legislation would likely affect the chemical industry due to anticipated increases in energy costs as fuel providers pass on the cost of the emissions allowances, which they would be required to obtain under cap-and-trade to cover the emissions from fuel production and the eventual use of fuel by the Company or its energy suppliers. In addition, cap-and-trade proposals would likely increase the cost of energy, including purchases of diesel fuel, steam and electricity, and certain raw materials used or transported by the Company. Proposed domestic and international cap-and-trade systems could materially increase raw material and operating costs of the Company\u2019s customer base. Future environmental regulatory developments related to climate change in the United States that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could result in financial impacts on the Company\u2019s operations that cannot be predicted with certainty at this time.\nThe Company\u2019s marine transportation segment is subject to volatility in the United States production of petrochemicals. For 2014, 47% of the marine transportation segment\u2019s revenues were from the movement of petrochemicals, including the movement of raw materials and feedstocks from one refinery or petrochemical plant to another, as well as the movement of more finished products to end users and terminals for export. During 2014, petrochemical volumes continued to improve compared with 2013 and 2012 primarily due to lower priced domestic natural gas that improved the competitiveness of the United States petrochemical industry in global markets, thereby producing increased marine transportation volumes for basic petrochemicals to both domestic consumers and terminals for export destinations. Higher natural gas prices and other factors could negatively impact the United States petrochemical industry and its production volumes, which would negatively impact the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s marine transportation segment could be adversely impacted by the construction of tank barges by its competitors. At the present time, there are an estimated 3,650 inland tank barges in the United States, of which the Company operates 884, or 24%. The number of tank barges peaked at an estimated 4,200 in 1982, slowly declined to 2,750 by 2003, and then gradually increased to an estimated 3,650 by the end of 2014. During 2012, the Company estimates that 260 tank barges were placed in service, of which 56 were for the Company, and 110 tank barges were retired, 52 of which were by the Company. During 2013, the Company estimates that 270 tank barges were placed in service, of which 70 were for the Company, and 70 tank barges were retired, 46 of which were by the Company. During 2014, the Company estimates that 300 tank barges were placed in service, of which 61 were for the Company, and 100 tank barges were retired, 38 of which were by the Company. The Company estimates that approximately 180 tank barges were ordered during 2014 for delivery throughout 2015, 39 of which are for the Company, and many older tank barges will be retired, dependent on 2015 market conditions. The increases for 2012, 2013 and 2014, and the orders for 2015, reflect the improved demand for inland petrochemical and black oil barges and federal tax incentives on new equipment in 2012 and 2013. Strong tank barge markets for 2012, 2013 and 2014 absorbed the additional capacity built by the industry.\nThe risk of an oversupply of inland tank barges may be mitigated by the fact that the inland tank barge industry has a mature fleet. Of the estimated 3,650 tank barges in the industry at the present time, approximately 725 are over 30 years old and approximately 500 of those over 35 years old. Given the age profile of the industry inland tank barge fleet, the expectation is that older tank barges will continue to be removed from service and replaced by new tank barges that will enter the fleet, with the extent of the retirements dependent on 2015 petrochemical and refinery production levels, crude oil and natural gas condensate movements and industry-wide tank barge utilization levels.\nDuring the first half of 2012, the marine transportation segment was negatively impacted by excess coastal tank barge capacity limiting tank barge utilization to the 75% range. The coastal operations reflected improvements in market conditions during the 2012 second half and throughout 2013, with tank barge utilization improving to the 75% to 80% range in the 2012 third quarter, 85% to 90% in the 2012 fourth quarter, continuing at 90% in 2013 and improving to the 90% to 95% range in 2014. During the 2012 second half and 2013 and 2014, the Company experienced increased demand for coastal crude and natural gas condensate moves and success in expanding the coastal customer base to include inland customers with coastal requirements. The Company estimates there are approximately 260 tank barges operating in the 195,000 barrel or less coastal industry fleet, the sector of the market in which the Company operates. The Company believes that very few coastal tank barges were built during 2012 and 2013 and that one coastal tank barge and tugboat unit was built and placed in service by a competitor during 2014. The Company announced in January 2014 the signing of an agreement to construct a 185,000 barrel coastal articulated tank barge and 10000 horsepower tugboat unit, with delivery anticipated for mid-to-late 2015. In April 2014, the Company exercised its option for the construction of a second 185,000 barrel coastal articulated tank barge and 10000 horsepower tugboat unit, with delivery anticipated for the first half of 2016. In July 2014, the Company signed agreements to construct two 155,000 barrel coastal articulated tank barge and 6000 horsepower tugboat units, the first for delivery in the 2016 second half and the second in the 2017 first half. The Company is aware of seven coastal tank barge and tugboat units in the 195,000 barrel or less class under construction by competitors for delivery in 2015, 2016 and 2017.\nHigher fuel prices could increase operating expenses. The cost of fuel during 2014 was approximately 13% of marine transportation revenue. All marine transportation term contracts contain fuel escalation clauses, or the customer pays for the fuel. However, there is generally a 30 to 90 day delay before contracts are adjusted depending on the specific contract. In general, the fuel escalation clauses are effective over the long-term in allowing the Company to adjust to changes in fuel costs due to fuel price changes; however, the short-term effectiveness of the fuel escalation clauses can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, specific terms of the fuel escalation formulas, fuel price volatility, navigating conditions, tow sizes, trip routing, and the location of loading and discharge ports that may result in the Company over or under recovering its fuel costs. Spot contract rates generally reflect current fuel prices at the time the contract is signed but do not have escalators for fuel.\nLoss of a large customer or other significant business relationship could adversely affect the Company. Four marine transportation customers accounted for approximately 25% of the Company\u2019s 2014 and 2013 revenue and 22% of 2012 revenue. The Company has contracts with these customers expiring in 2015 through 2017. Although the Company considers its relationships with these companies to be strong, the loss of any of these customers could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s diesel engine services segment has a 49-year relationship with EMD, the largest manufacturer of medium-speed diesel engines. In addition, the Company serves as both an EMD distributor and service center for select markets and locations for both service and parts. Sales and service of EMD products account for approximately 3% of the Company\u2019s revenue for 2014. Although the Company considers its relationship with EMD to be strong, the loss of the EMD distributorship and service rights, or a disruption of the supply of EMD parts, could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s ability to service its customers.\nUnited has maintained continuous exclusive distribution rights for MTU and Allison since 1946. United is one of MTU\u2019s top five distributors of off-highway engines in North America, with exclusive distribution rights in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. In addition, as a distributor of Allison products, United has distribution rights in Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. United is also the exclusive distributor for Daimler for engines and related equipment in Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. Sales and service of MTU and Allison products account for approximately 2% and 3%, respectively, of the Company\u2019s revenue during 2014. Although the Company considers its relationships with MTU and Allison to be strong, the loss of MTU, Allison or Daimler distributorships and service rights, or a disruption of the supply of MTU or Allison parts, could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s ability to service its customers.\nThe Company is subject to competition in both its marine transportation and diesel engine services segments. The inland and coastal tank barge industry remains very competitive. The Company\u2019s primary competitors are noncaptive inland tank barge operators and coastal operators. The Company also competes with companies who operate refined product and petrochemical pipelines, railroad tank cars and tractor-trailer tank trucks. Increased competition from any significant expansion of or additions to facilities or equipment by the Company\u2019s competitors could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe diesel engine services industry is also very competitive. The segment\u2019s primary marine competitors are independent diesel services companies and other factory-authorized distributors, authorized service centers and authorized marine dealers. Certain operators of diesel powered marine equipment also elect to maintain in-house service capabilities. In the power generation market, the primary competitors are other independent service companies. The segment\u2019s land-based market\u2019s principal competitors are independent diesel engine service and oilfield manufacturing companies and other factory-authorized distributors and service centers. In addition, certain oilfield service companies that are customers of the Company also manufacture and service a portion of their own oilfield equipment. Increased competition in the diesel engine services industry and continued low price of natural gas, crude oil or natural gas condensate, and resulting decline in drilling for such natural resources in North American shale formations, could result in less oilfield equipment being manufactured and remanufactured, lower rates for service and parts pricing and result in less manufacturing, remanufacturing, service and repair opportunities and parts sales for the Company.\nSignificant increases in the construction cost of tank barges and towboats may limit the Company\u2019s ability to earn an adequate return on its investment in new tank barges and towboats. The price of steel increased significantly from 2006 to 2009, thereby increasing the construction cost of new tank barges and towboats. The Company\u2019s average construction price for a new 30,000 barrel capacity inland tank barge ordered in 2008 for 2009 delivery was approximately 90% higher than in 2000, primarily due to the increase in steel prices. During 2009, the United States and global recession negatively impacted demand levels for inland tank barges and as a result, the construction price of inland tank barges for 2010 delivery fell significantly, primarily due to a significant decrease in steel prices, as well as a decrease in the number of tank barges ordered. The average construction price for tank barges delivered in 2012, 2013 and 2014 and ordered in 2014 for delivery in 2015 increased, but remained below the construction price for tank barges delivered in 2009.\nThe Company\u2019s marine transportation segment could be adversely impacted by the failure of the Company\u2019s shipyard vendors to deliver new vessels according to contractually agreed delivery schedules and terms. The Company contracts with shipyards to build new vessels and currently has many vessels under construction. Construction projects are subject to risks of delay and cost overruns, resulting from shortages of equipment, materials and skilled labor; lack of shipyard availability; unforeseen design and engineering problems; work stoppages; weather interference; unanticipated cost increases; unscheduled delays in the delivery of material and equipment; and financial and other difficulties at shipyards including labor disputes, shipyard insolvency and inability to obtain necessary certifications and approvals. A significant delay in the construction of new vessels or a shipyard\u2019s inability to perform under the construction contract could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to fulfill contract commitments and to realize timely revenues with respect to vessels under construction. Significant cost overruns or delays for vessels under construction could also adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s diesel engine services segment could be adversely impacted by future legislation or additional regulation of hydraulic fracturing practices. The Company, through its United subsidiary, is a distributor and service provider of engine and transmission related products for the oil and gas services, power generation and transportation industries, and a manufacturer of oilfield service equipment, including pressure pumping units. The EPA is studying hydraulic fracturing practices, and legislation may be introduced in Congress that would authorize the EPA to impose additional regulations on hydraulic fracturing. In addition, a number of states have adopted or are evaluating the adoption of legislation or regulations governing hydraulic fracturing. Such federal or state legislation and/or regulations could materially impact customers\u2019 operations and greatly reduce or eliminate demand for the Company\u2019s pressure pumping fracturing equipment and related products. The Company is unable to predict whether future legislation or any other regulations will ultimately be enacted and, if so, the impact on the Company\u2019s diesel engine services segment.\nThe Company relies on critical information systems for the operation of its businesses, and the failure of any critical information system, including a cyber-security breach, may adversely impact its businesses. The Company is dependent on its technology infrastructure and must maintain and rely upon critical information systems for the effective and safe operation of its businesses. These information systems include software applications and hardware equipment, as well as data networks and telecommunications.\nThe Company\u2019s information systems, including the Company\u2019s proprietary vessel management computer system, are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources, including but not limited to, natural disasters, software viruses, power failures and cyber-attacks. The Company has implemented measures such as emergency recovery processes, virus protection software, intrusion detection systems and annual attack and penetration audits to mitigate these risks. However, the Company cannot guarantee that its information systems cannot be damaged or compromised.\nAny damage or compromise of its data security or its inability to use or access these critical information systems could adversely impact the efficient and safe operation of its businesses, or result in the failure to maintain the confidentiality of data of its customers or its employees and could subject the Company to increased operating expenses or legal action, which could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nAn easing or lifting of the United States crude oil export ban could adversely impact the Company\u2019s marine transportation segment. Over the last four decades, the ability of United States producers to export domestic crude oil has been limited by the United States government. As crude oil production has increased in the United States due to hydraulic fracturing and shale oil production, there have been more calls by crude oil producers for the United States government to change its energy policy to ease or lift the crude oil export ban. Although the impact on the Company\u2019s inland barge operations is not determinable, the easing of the crude oil export ban could result in reduced coastal barge moves which may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s marine transportation segment. Alternatively, higher crude volumes, for domestic or export consumption, may be a positive as regional moves and moves to export terminals could increase.\nPrevailing natural gas and crude oil prices, as well as the volatility of their prices, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses. Demand for tank barge transportation services is driven by the production of volumes of the bulk liquid commodities such as petrochemicals, black oil and refined products that the Company transports by tank barge. This production can depend on the prevailing level of natural gas and crude oil prices, as well as the volatility of their prices.\nIn general, lower energy prices are good for the United States economy and typically translate into increased petrochemical and refined product production and therefore increased demand for tank barge transportation services. However, lower crude oil prices could result in a decline in domestic crude oil and natural gas condensate production and reduced volumes to be transported by tank barge. The Company currently operates approximately 6% of its inland barges and approximately 13% of its coastal barges in the transportation of crude oil and natural gas condensate. Volatility in the price of natural gas and crude oil can also result in heightened uncertainty which may lead to decreased production and delays in new petrochemical and refinery plant construction. Increased competition for available black oil and petrochemical barge moves caused by reduced crude oil and natural gas condensate production could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s marine transportation segment.\nLower energy prices generally result in a decrease in the number of oil and gas wells being drilled. Oilfield service companies reduce their capital spending, resulting in decreased demand for new parts and equipment, including pressure pumping units, provided by the Company\u2019s diesel engine services segment. This may also lead to order cancellations from customers or customers requesting to delay delivery of new equipment. In addition to the possibility that decreased energy prices may result in reduced demand for the Company\u2019s parts and equipment, energy price volatility may also result in difficulties in the Company\u2019s ability to ramp up and ramp down production on a timely basis and, therefore, could result in an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s diesel engine services segment.\nThe Company\u2019s diesel engine services segment could be adversely impacted by the construction of pressure pumping units by its competitors. At the present time, there is an estimated 19.5 million horsepower of pressure pumping units in North America used in the hydraulic fracturing of shale formations. Increased expansion of, or additions to, facilities or equipment by the Company\u2019s competitors could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations. A significant drop in demand as well could result in oversupply in the pressure pumping market as attrition rates may not be high enough to absorb the new capacity entering the market and could negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.", "PERMNO": 59045, "SIC": 4400, "TIC": "KEX"}
