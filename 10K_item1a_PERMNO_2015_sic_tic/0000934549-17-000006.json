RISK FACTORS\nThe following is a summary of certain risks we face in our business. They are not the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly. All patent portfolio investments, development, licensing and enforcement activities are conducted solely by certain of our wholly and majority-owned operating subsidiaries.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses and may incur additional losses in the future.\nWe reported a net loss of $54.1 million (includes $42.3 million of noncash patent impairment charges), $160.0 million (includes $104.9 million of noncash goodwill and patent impairment charges) and $66.0 million (includes $3.5 million of noncash patent impairment charges) for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, and on a cumulative basis, we have sustained substantial losses since our inception. As of December 31, 2016, our accumulated deficit was $342.2 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $158.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments and working capital of $160.3 million. We expect to continue incurring significant legal, general and administrative expenses in connection with our operations. As a result, we anticipate that we may incur losses in the future. We believe, however, that our current cash and cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to finance our anticipated capital and operating requirements for at least the next twelve months.\nOur ability to use net operating losses and certain other tax attributes is uncertain and may be limited.\nOur ability to use our federal and state net operating losses to offset potential future taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is dependent upon our generation of future taxable income before the expiration dates of the net operating losses, and we cannot predict with certainty when, or whether, we will generate sufficient taxable income to use all of our net operating losses. In addition, utilization of net operating losses to offset potential future taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is subject to annual limitations under the \u201cownership change\u201d provisions of Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and similar state provisions, which may result in the expiration of net operating losses before future utilization. In general, under the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating losses and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research and development credit carryforwards) to offset its post-change taxable income or taxes may be limited. Changes in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control, could in the future result in an ownership change. Although we have completed studies to provide reasonable assurance that an ownership change limitation would not apply, we cannot be certain that a taxing authority would reach the same conclusion. If, after a review or audit, an ownership change limitation were to apply, utilization of our domestic net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards could be limited in future periods and a portion of the carryforwards could expire before being available to reduce future income tax liabilities.\nIf we encounter unforeseen difficulties with our business or operations in the future that require us to obtain additional working capital, and we cannot obtain additional working capital on favorable terms, or at all, our business may suffer.\nOur consolidated cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments totaled $158.5 million and $145.9 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. To date, we have relied primarily upon net cash flows from our operations and from the public and private sale of equity securities to generate the working capital needed to finance our operations.\nWe may encounter unforeseen difficulties with our business or operations in the future that may deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated. As a result, we may be required to obtain additional working capital in the future through bank credit facilities, public or private debt or equity financings, or otherwise. If we are required to raise additional working capital in the future, such financing may be unavailable to us on favorable terms, if at all, or may be dilutive to our existing stockholders. If we fail to obtain additional working capital, as and when needed, such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to effectively manage our operational changes could strain our managerial, operational and financial resources and could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur recent operational changes have placed, and are expected to continue to place, a strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems. Operational changes primarily relate to the resignation of Matthew Vella, our former Chief Executive Officer and President in December 2015, the appointment of Marvin Key, Chief Executive Officer of Acacia Research Group LLC, to Chief Executive Officer of Acacia Research Corporation in December 2015, and reductions in employee headcount across our licensing, business development and engineering functions in 2015 and 2016. Further, as our operating subsidiary companies\u2019 businesses grow or change, we will be required to continue to manage multiple relationships. Any further growth or change by us or our subsidiary companies, or an increase in the number of our strategic relationships, may place additional strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems. Although we may not grow, if we fail to manage our growth or other operational changes effectively or to develop, expand or otherwise modify our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems, our business and financial results will be materially harmed.\nPotential patent portfolio investments may present risks, and we may be unable to achieve the financial or other goals intended at the time of any potential investment.\nOur future growth depends, in part, on our ability to invest in patented technologies, patent portfolios, or companies holding such patented technologies and patent portfolios. Accordingly, we have engaged in patent portfolio investments to expand our patent portfolios and we intend to continue to explore such investments. Such investments are subject to numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nour inability to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to any potential patent portfolio investment, or if we are able to enter into such agreement, our inability to consummate the potential investment transaction;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the operations, technology and personnel of the acquired entity;\n\u2022\nour inability to achieve the anticipated financial and other benefits of the specific patent portfolio investment;\n\u2022\nour inability to retain key personnel from the acquired company, if necessary;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration process;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; and\n\u2022\nfailure of our due diligence process to identify significant issues, including issues with respect to patented technologies and patent portfolios, and other legal and financial contingencies.\nIf we are unable to manage these risks effectively as part of any patent portfolio investment, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur revenues are unpredictable, and this may harm our financial condition.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, anticipated cash flow from operations, proceeds from prior offerings of our common stock (refer to \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below) and other external sources of available credit, will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through at least March 2018 and for the foreseeable future. However, due to the nature of our licensing business and uncertainties regarding the amount and timing of the receipt of license and other fees from potential infringers, stemming primarily from uncertainties regarding the outcome of enforcement actions, rates of adoption of our patented technologies, the growth rates of our existing licensees and certain other factors, our revenues may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and period to period, which could make our business difficult to manage, adversely affect our business and operating results, cause our quarterly and periodic results to fall below market expectations and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur operating subsidiaries depend upon relationships with others to provide technology-based opportunities that can develop into profitable royalty-bearing licenses, and if they are unable to maintain and generate new relationships, then they may not be able to sustain existing levels of revenue or increase revenue.\nNeither we nor our operating subsidiaries invent new technologies or products; rather, we depend upon the identification and investment in patents and inventions and companies that own intellectual property through our relationships\nwith inventors, universities, research institutions, technology companies and others. If our operating subsidiaries are unable to maintain those relationships and to continue to identify and grow new relationships, then we may not be able to identify new technology-based opportunities for sustainable revenue and /or revenue growth.\nOur current or future relationships may not provide the volume or quality of technologies necessary to sustain our licensing and enforcement business. In some cases, universities and other technology sources compete against us as they seek to develop and commercialize technologies. Universities may receive financing for basic research in exchange for the exclusive right to commercialize resulting inventions. These and other strategies employed by potential partners may reduce the number of technology sources and potential clients to whom we can market our solutions. If we are unable to maintain current relationships and sources of technology or to secure new relationships and sources of technology, such inability may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to maintain our licensing and enforcement business.\nFor example, for the year ended December 31, 2016, we obtained control of only 2 new patent portfolios. Further, in fiscal year 2015, we obtained control of 3 new patent portfolios, compared to 6 new patent portfolios, and 25 new patent portfolios in fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively. This decrease in our patent portfolio intake reflects in part our strategic decision in 2013 to shift the focus of our operating business to serving a smaller number of customers, each having higher quality patent portfolios. As a result, our gross number of patent portfolio acquisitions has decreased significantly. This decrease in our patent portfolio intake also reflects in part industry trends impacting our ability to acquire patent portfolios. For example, legislative and legal changes have increased the complexity of patent enforcement actions and may significantly affect the market availability of suitable patent portfolios for acquisition. These industry trends have continued, and as a result, our recent and future patent portfolio intake has been and may continue to be negatively impacted, resulting in further decreases in future revenue generating opportunities, and continued negative adverse impacts on the sustainability of our licensing and enforcement business. We continue to experience significant adverse challenges with respect to our patent intake efforts, and if these adverse challenges continue, our revenues will decline and we will be unable to profitably sustain our licensing and enforcement business going forward.\nAs a result of the foregoing, our operating subsidiaries may from time to time evaluate other business opportunities which compliment, or supplement, our primary licensing and enforcement business and leverage our intellectual property expertise.\nThe success of our operating subsidiaries depends in part upon their ability to retain the best legal counsel to represent them in patent enforcement litigation.\nThe success of our licensing business depends upon our operating subsidiaries\u2019 ability to retain the best legal counsel to prosecute patent infringement litigation. As our operating subsidiaries\u2019 patent enforcement actions increase, it will become more difficult to find the best legal counsel to handle all of our cases because many of the best law firms may have a conflict of interest that prevents their representation of our subsidiaries.\nWe spend a significant amount of our financial and management resources to pursue our current litigation matters. We believe that these litigation matters and others that we may in the future determine to pursue could continue for years and continue to consume significant financial and management resources. The counterparties to our litigation are sometimes large, well-financed companies with substantially greater resources than us. We cannot assure that any of our current or future litigation matters will result in a favorable outcome for us. In addition, in part due to the appeals process and other legal processes, even if we obtain favorable interim rulings or verdicts in particular litigation matters, they may not be predictive of the ultimate resolution of the dispute. Also, we cannot assure that we will not be exposed to claims or sanctions against us which may be costly or impossible for us to defend. Unfavorable or adverse outcomes may result in losses, exhaustion of financial resources or other adverse effects which could encumber our ability to develop and commercialize products.\nIn connection with any of our patent enforcement actions, it is possible that a defendant may request and/or a court may rule that we have violated statutory authority, regulatory authority, federal rules, local court rules, or governing standards relating to the substantive or procedural aspects of such enforcement actions. In such event, a court may issue monetary sanctions against us or our operating subsidiaries or award attorney\u2019s fees and/or expenses to a defendant(s), which could be material, and if required to be paid by us or our operating subsidiaries, could materially harm our operating results and our financial position.\nOur operating subsidiaries, in certain circumstances, rely on representations, warranties and opinions made by third-parties that, if determined to be false or inaccurate, may expose us and our operating subsidiaries to certain material liabilities.\nFrom time to time, our operating subsidiaries may rely upon representations and warranties made by third-parties from whom our operating subsidiaries acquired patents or the exclusive rights to license and enforce patents. We also may rely upon the opinions of purported experts. In certain instances, we may not have the opportunity to independently investigate and verify the facts upon which such representations, warranties, and opinions are made. By relying on these representations, warranties and opinions, our operating subsidiaries may be exposed to liabilities in connection with the licensing and enforcement of certain patents and patent rights which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIn connection with patent enforcement actions conducted by certain of our subsidiaries, a court may rule that we or our subsidiaries have violated certain statutory, regulatory, federal, local or governing rules or standards, which may expose us and our operating subsidiaries to certain material liabilities.\nIn connection with any of our patent enforcement actions, it is possible that a defendant may request and/or a court may rule that we have violated statutory authority, regulatory authority, federal rules, local court rules, or governing standards relating to the substantive or procedural aspects of such enforcement actions. In such event, a court may issue monetary sanctions against us or our operating subsidiaries or award attorney\u2019s fees and/or expenses to a defendant(s), which could be material, and if we or our operating subsidiaries are required to pay such monetary sanctions, attorneys\u2019 fees and/or expenses, such payment could materially harm our operating results and our financial position.\nIn connection with patent enforcement actions conducted by certain of our subsidiaries, a court may find the patents invalid, not infringed or unenforceable and/or the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, or other relevant patent office, may either invalidate the patents or materially narrow the scope of their claims during the course of a reexamination, opposition or other such proceeding.\nPatent litigation is inherently risky and the outcome is uncertain. Some of the parties that we believe infringe on our patents are large and well-financed companies with substantially greater resources than ours. We believe that these parties would devote a substantial amount of resources in an attempt to avoid or limit a finding that they are liable for infringing on our patents or, in the event liability is found, to avoid or limit the amount of associated damages. In addition, there is a risk that these parties may file reexaminations or other proceedings with the USPTO or other government agencies in the United States or abroad in an attempt to invalidate, narrow the scope or render unenforceable the patents we own or control. If this were to occur, it may have a material adverse effect on the viability of our company and our operations.\nIn addition, it is difficult to predict the outcome of patent enforcement litigation at any level. In the United States, there is a higher rate of appeals in patent enforcement litigation than standard business litigation. The defendant to any case we bring, may file as many appeals as allowed by right, including to the first, second and/or final courts of appeal (in the United States those courts would be the Federal Circuit and Supreme Court, respectively). Such appeals are expensive and time-consuming, and the outcomes of such appeals are sometimes unpredictable, resulting in increased costs and reduced or delayed revenue.\nOur licensing cycle is lengthy and costly, and our legal and sales efforts may be unsuccessful.\nWe expect our operating subsidiaries to incur significant general and administrative, legal and sales expenses prior to entering into license agreements and generating license revenues. We will also spend considerable resources educating prospective licensees on the benefits of a license arrangement with us. As such, we may incur significant losses in any particular period before any associated revenue stream begins.\nIf our efforts to educate prospective licensees on the benefits of a license arrangement are unsuccessful, we may need to pursue litigation or other enforcement action to protect our patent rights. We may also need to litigate to enforce the terms of our existing license agreements, protect our trade secrets, or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Enforcement proceedings are typically protracted and complex. The costs are typically substantial, and the outcomes are unpredictable. Enforcement actions will divert our managerial, technical, legal and financial resources from business operations.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could cause our financial reports to be inaccurate\nWe are required pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to assess and report on the effectiveness of those controls. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. As a result of a material weakness identified in our internal control over financial reporting relating to the accounting for infrequent, unusual, or complex accounting matters, our management assessed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016. We developed a plan to address the material weakness and enhance our control procedures related to infrequent, unusual, or complex accounting matters and implemented the revised procedures in the fourth quarter of 2016. However, due to the short period of time and limited use of this new control as contemplated by the applicable Public Company Accounting Oversight Board standards, we are unable to conclude in this report as to the operating effectiveness of our enhanced review procedures and documentation standards as of December 31, 2016. Our goal is to remediate this material weakness as contemplated by the standards by the end of the first quarter of 2017, subject to there being sufficient opportunities to conclude, through testing, that the enhanced control is operating effectively.\nWhile management believes the enhanced internal controls implemented will remediate the material weakness identified, there is no assurance that the changes will remediate the identified material weakness or that the controls will prevent or detect future material weaknesses. If we are not able to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our financial statements, including related disclosures, may be inaccurate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur exposure to uncontrollable outside influences, including new legislation, court rulings or actions by the USPTO, could adversely affect our licensing and enforcement business and results of operations.\nOur licensing and enforcement business is subject to numerous risks from outside influences, including the following:\nNew legislation, regulations or rules related to obtaining patents or enforcing patents could significantly increase our operating costs and decrease our revenue.\nOur operating subsidiaries invest in patents with enforcement opportunities and spend a significant amount of resources to enforce those patents. If new legislation, regulations or rules are implemented by Congress, the USPTO or the courts that impact the patent application process, the patent enforcement process or the rights of patent holders, such changes could negatively affect our business. Recently, United States patent laws were amended with the enactment of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, which took effect on March 16, 2013. The America Invents Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. In general, the legislation attempts to address issues surrounding the enforceability of patents and the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for patent litigation. For example, the America Invents Act changes the way that parties may be joined in patent infringement actions, increasing the likelihood that such actions will need to be brought against individual allegedly-infringing parties by their respective individual actions or activities. In addition, the America Invents Act enacted a new inter-partes review process at the USPTO which can be, and often is, used by defendants, and other individuals and entities, to separately challenge the validity of any patent. The IPR process of the AIA has in many instances increased costs for licensing and litigation and has resulted in the loss of certain portfolio patents which in some cases may have negatively impacted the value of those portfolios. The America Invents Act and its implementation has increased the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of our patented technologies, which in certain circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice, or the DOJ, has conducted reviews of the patent system to evaluate the impact of patent assertion entities on industries in which those patents relate. It is possible that the findings and recommendations of the DOJ could impact the ability to effectively license and enforce standards-essential patents and could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of any such patented technologies. Also, in 2014, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, initiated a study under Section 6(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act to evaluate the patent assertion practice and market impact of Patent Assertion Entities, or PAEs. The FTC\u2019s initial notice and request for public comment relating to the PAE study appeared in the Federal Register on October 3, 2013. We received and responded to a request for information as part of this FTC study. The FTC study entitled, \"Patent Assertion Entity Activity\" was released in October 2016.\nFinally, new rules regarding the burden of proof in patent enforcement actions could significantly increase the cost of our enforcement actions, and new standards or limitations on liability for patent infringement could negatively impact our revenue derived from such enforcement actions. In addition, recent federal court decisions have lowered the threshold for obtaining attorneys\u2019 fees in patent infringement cases and increased the level of deference given to a district court\u2019s fee-shifting determination. These decisions may make it easier for district courts to shift a prevailing party\u2019s attorneys' fees to a non-prevailing party if the district court believes that the case was weak or conducted in an abusive manner. As a result, defendants in patent infringement actions brought by non-practicing entities may elect not to settle because these decisions make it much easier for defendants to get attorneys\u2019 fees.\nChanges in patent law could adversely impact our business.\nPatent laws may continue to change, and may alter the historically consistent protections afforded to owners of patent rights. Such changes may not be advantageous for us and may make it more difficult to obtain adequate patent protection to enforce our patents against infringing parties. Increased focus on the growing number of patent-related lawsuits may result in legislative changes which increase our costs and related risks of asserting patent enforcement actions. For instance, the United States Congress has considered a bill that would require, among other things, non-practicing entities that bring patent infringement lawsuits to pay legal costs of the defendants, if the lawsuits are unsuccessful and certain standards are not met.\nTrial judges and juries often find it difficult to understand complex patent enforcement litigation, and as a result, we may need to appeal adverse decisions by lower courts in order to successfully enforce our patents.\nIt is difficult to predict the outcome of patent enforcement litigation at the trial level. It is often difficult for juries and trial judges to understand complex, patented technologies, and as a result, there is a higher rate of successful appeals in patent enforcement litigation than more standard business litigation. Such appeals are expensive and time consuming, resulting in increased costs and delayed revenue. Although we diligently pursue enforcement litigation, we cannot predict with significant reliability the decisions made by juries and trial courts.\nMore patent applications are filed each year resulting in longer delays in getting patents issued by the USPTO.\nCertain of our operating subsidiaries hold and continue to invest in pending patents. We have identified a trend of increasing patent applications each year, which we believe is resulting in longer delays in obtaining approval of pending patent applications. The application delays could cause delays in recognizing revenue from these patents and could cause us to miss opportunities to license patents before other competing technologies are developed or introduced into the market.\nFederal courts are becoming more crowded, and as a result, patent enforcement litigation is taking longer.\nOur patent enforcement actions are almost exclusively prosecuted in federal court. Federal trial courts that hear our patent enforcement actions also hear criminal cases. Criminal cases always take priority over our actions. As a result, it is difficult to predict the length of time it will take to complete an enforcement action. Moreover, we believe there is a trend in increasing numbers of civil lawsuits and criminal proceedings before federal judges and, as a result, we believe that the risk of delays in our patent enforcement actions will have a greater effect on our business in the future unless this trend changes.\nAny reductions in the funding of the USPTO could have an adverse impact on the cost of processing pending patent applications and the value of those pending patent applications.\nThe assets of our operating subsidiaries consist of patent portfolios, including pending patent applications before the USPTO. The value of our patent portfolios is dependent upon the issuance of patents in a timely manner, and any reductions in the funding of the USPTO could negatively impact the value of our assets. Further, reductions in funding from Congress could result in higher patent application filing and maintenance fees charged by the USPTO, causing an unexpected increase in our expenses.\nCompetition is intense in the industries in which our subsidiaries do business and as a result, we may not be able to grow or maintain our market share for our technologies and patents.\nWe expect to encounter competition in the area of patent portfolio investments and enforcement as the number of companies entering this market is increasing. This includes competitors seeking to invest in the same or similar patents and technologies that we may seek to invest in. Entities including RPX, AST, Intellectual Ventures, Wi-LAN, Conversant, Round Rock Research LLC, IPvalue Management Inc., Vringo Inc., VirnetX and Pendrell Corporation compete in acquiring rights to patents, and we expect more entities to enter the market. As new technological advances occur, many of our patented\ntechnologies may become obsolete before they are completely monetized. If we are unable to replace obsolete technologies with more technologically advanced patented technologies, then this obsolescence could have a negative effect on our ability to generate future revenues.\nOur licensing business also competes with venture capital firms and various industry leaders for patent licensing opportunities. Many of these competitors may have more financial and human resources than we do. As we become more successful, we may find more companies entering the market for similar technology opportunities, which may reduce our market share in one or more technology industries that we currently rely upon to generate future revenue.\nOur patented technologies face uncertain market value.\nOur operating subsidiaries have invested in patents and technologies that may be in the early stages of adoption in the commercial and consumer markets. Demand for some of these technologies is untested and is subject to fluctuation based upon the rate at which our licensees will adopt our patents and technologies in their products and services.\nFurther, significant judgment is required in connection with estimates of the recoverability of the carrying value of our intangible patent assets, including estimates of market values, estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows, and estimates of other factors that are used to determine the fair value and recoverability of the respective patent asset values. Developments with respect to ongoing patent litigation, patent challenges and re-exams, legislative and judicial decisions and other factors outside of our control, may unfavorably impact the validity, applicability, and enforceability of our patent assets, and therefore, negatively impact the future value of our patent portfolios. If certain of these unfavorable events occur, our estimates or related projections may change materially in future periods, and future intangible asset impairment tests may result in material charges to earnings.\nAs patent enforcement litigation becomes more prevalent, it may become more difficult for us to voluntarily license our patents.\nWe believe that the more prevalent patent enforcement actions become, the more difficult it will be for us to voluntarily license our patents. As a result, we may need to increase the number of our patent enforcement actions to cause infringing companies to license the patent or pay damages for lost royalties. This may increase the risks associated with an investment in our company.\nPatent litigation trials and scheduled trial dates are subject to routine delay, and any such delays could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPatent infringement trials are components of our overall patent licensing process and are one of many factors that contribute to the existence of possible future revenue opportunities for us. Patent litigation schedules in general, and in particular trial dates, are subject to routine adjustment, and in most cases delay, as courts adjust their calendars or respond to requests from one or more parties. Trial dates often are rescheduled by the court for various reasons that are often unrelated to the underlying patent assets and typically for reasons that are beyond our control. As a result, to the extent such events are an indicator of possible future revenue opportunities for us, or other outcome determinative events, they may and often do change which can result in delay of the expected scheduled event. Any such delay could be significant and could affect the corresponding future revenue opportunities, thus adversely impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe markets served by our operating subsidiaries are subject to rapid technological change, and if our operating subsidiaries are unable to develop and invest in new technologies and patents, our ability to generate revenues could be substantially impaired.\nThe markets served by our operating subsidiaries and their licensees frequently undergo transitions in which products rapidly incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. Products for communications applications and high-speed computing applications, as well as other applications covered by our operating subsidiaries\u2019 intellectual property, are based on continually evolving industry standards. In addition, the communications industry is intensely competitive and has been impacted by price erosion, rapid technological change, short product life cycles, cyclical market patterns and increasing foreign and domestic competition. Our ability to compete in the future will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards. This will require our continued efforts and success in acquiring new patent portfolios with licensing and enforcement opportunities. While we expect for the foreseeable future to have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to maintain the level of patent portfolio investments necessary to keep pace with these technological advances, various factors may require us to have greater liquidity and capital resources than we currently\nexpect. If we are unable to invest in new patented technologies and patent portfolios, or to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards, our ability to generate revenues could be substantially impaired and our business and financial condition could be materially harmed.\nUncertainty in global economic conditions could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur revenue-generating opportunities depend on the use of our patented technologies by existing and prospective licensees, the overall demand for the products and services of our licensees, and on the overall economic and financial health of our licensees. Although economic conditions appear to be improving, recent uncertainties in global economic conditions have resulted in the tightening of the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, and extreme volatility in the credit, equity and fixed income markets. If economic conditions do not continue to improve, or if they further deteriorate, many of our licensees\u2019 customers, which may rely on credit financing, may delay or reduce their purchases of our licensees\u2019 products and services. In addition, the use or adoption of our patented technologies is often based on current and forecasted demand for our licensees\u2019 products and services in the marketplace and may require companies to make significant initial commitments of capital and other resources. If negative conditions in the global credit markets delay or prevent our licensees\u2019 and their customers\u2019 access to credit, overall consumer spending on the products and services of our licensees may decrease and the adoption or use of our patented technologies may slow, respectively. Further, if the markets in which our licensees\u2019 participate do not continue to improve, or deteriorate further, this could negatively impact our licensees\u2019 long-term sales and revenue generation, margins and operating expenses, which could in turn have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we have significant patent-related intangible assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. We will continue to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our patent-related intangible assets on an ongoing basis, and we may incur substantial impairment charges, which would adversely affect our consolidated financial results. There can be no assurance that the outcome of such reviews in the future will not result in substantial impairment charges. Impairment assessment inherently involves judgment as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions as to prices, costs, holding periods or other factors that may result in changes in our estimates of future cash flows. Although we believe the assumptions we used in testing for impairment are reasonable, significant changes in any one of our assumptions could produce a significantly different result.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe availability of shares for sale in the future could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may issue securities to raise cash for operations and patent portfolio investments. We may also pay for interests in additional subsidiary companies by using shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. We may also issue securities convertible into our common stock. Any of these events may dilute stockholders\u2019 ownership interests in our company and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nIn addition, sales of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities.\nDelaware law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover of our company that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares.\nProvisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make the acquisition of our company by means of a tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, and the removal of incumbent officers and directors, more difficult. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a merger with a 15%-or-greater stockholder, such as a party that has completed a successful tender offer, until three years after that party became a 15%-or-greater stockholder;\n\u2022\namendment of our bylaws by the stockholders requires a two-thirds approval of the outstanding shares;\n\u2022\nthe authorization in our certificate of incorporation of undesignated preferred stock, which could be issued without stockholder approval in a manner designed to prevent or discourage a takeover;\n\u2022\nprovisions in our bylaws eliminating stockholders\u2019 rights to call a special meeting of stockholders, which could make it more difficult for stockholders to wage a proxy contest for control of our board of directors or to vote to repeal any of the anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws; and\n\u2022\nthe division of our board of directors into three classes with staggered terms for each class, which could make it more difficult for an outsider to gain control of our board of directors.\nTogether, these provisions may make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that could otherwise involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nWe may fail to meet market expectations because of fluctuations in quarterly operating results, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur reported revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future. It is possible that in future periods, revenues could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The following are among the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period:\n\u2022\nthe dollar amount of agreements executed in each period, which is primarily driven by the nature and characteristics of the technology being licensed and the magnitude of infringement associated with a specific licensee;\n\u2022\nthe specific terms and conditions of agreements executed in each period and the periods of infringement contemplated by the respective payments;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the total number of agreements executed;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the sales results or other royalty-per-unit activities of our licensees that impact the calculation of license fees due;\n\u2022\nthe timing of the receipt of periodic license fee payments and/or reports from licensees;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the net number of active licensees period to period;\n\u2022\ncosts related to investments, alliances, licenses and other efforts to expand our operations;\n\u2022\nthe timing of payments under the terms of any customer or license agreements into which our operating subsidiaries may enter;\n\u2022\nexpenses related to, and the timing and results of, patent filings and other enforcement proceedings relating to intellectual property rights, as more fully described in this section; and\n\u2022\nnew litigation or developments in current litigation and the unpredictability of litigation results or settlements or appeals.\nTechnology company stock prices are especially volatile, and this volatility may depress the price of our common stock.\nThe stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, and the market prices of technology companies have been highly volatile. We believe that various factors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nannouncements of developments in our patent enforcement actions;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our patents;\n\u2022\nour or our competitors\u2019 technological innovations;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in relationships with licensees;\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nour failure to meet or exceed securities analysts\u2019 expectations of our financial results;\n\u2022\na change in financial estimates or securities analysts\u2019 recommendations;\n\u2022\nchanges in management\u2019s or securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nconcerns about sovereign debt of the United States and the European Union;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, investments, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, new technologies, or patents; and\n\u2022\nfailure to complete significant transactions.\nFor example, the NASDAQ-100 Technology Sector Index (NDXT) had a range of $1,942.62 - $2,953.37 during the 52-weeks ended December 31, 2016 and the NASDAQ Composite Index (IXIC) had a range of $4,209.76 - $5,512.37 over the same period. Over the same period, our common stock fluctuated within a range of $2.82 - $7.68.\nThe recent financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets and the uncertainty in global economic conditions have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, and extreme volatility in the credit, equity and fixed income markets. As noted above, our stock price, like many others, has fluctuated significantly in recent periods and if investors have concerns that our business, operating results and financial condition will be negatively impacted by global economic conditions, our stock price could continue to fluctuate significantly in future periods.\nIn addition, we believe that fluctuations in our stock price during applicable periods can also be impacted by court rulings and/or other developments in our patent licensing and enforcement actions. Court rulings in patent enforcement actions are often difficult to understand, even when favorable or neutral to the value of our patents and our overall business, and we believe that investors in the market may overreact, causing fluctuations in our stock prices that may not accurately reflect the impact of court rulings on our business operations and assets.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the objects of securities class action litigation. If our common stock was the object of securities class action litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially harm our business and financial results.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nOn February 23, 2016, our board of directors eliminated our dividend policy that provided for the discretionary payment of a total annual cash dividend of $0.50 per common share, payable in the amount of $0.125 per share per quarter, effective as of February 23, 2016. As a result, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.", "PERMNO": 89611, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "ACTG"}
