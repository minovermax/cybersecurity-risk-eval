{"cik": "1415301", "company": "Del Frisco's Restaurant Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nChanges in general economic conditions, including economic uncertainty, have adversely impacted our business and results of operations in the past, may continue to do so and may do so in the future.\nPurchases at our restaurants are discretionary for consumers, and we are therefore susceptible to economic slowdowns. We believe that consumers generally are more willing to make discretionary purchases, including high-end restaurant meals, during favorable economic conditions. Economic uncertainty, including high unemployment and financial market volatility and unpredictability, including as a result of events similar to the 2008-2009 economic recession, and the related reduction in consumer confidence, can negatively affect customer traffic and sales throughout our industry, including our segment. If the economy experiences a new downturn or there are continued uncertainties regarding U.S. budgetary and fiscal policies, including recent tax legislation, our customers, including our business clientele, may reduce their level of discretionary spending, impacting the frequency with which they choose to dine out or the amount they spend on meals while dining out. We believe the majority of our weekday revenues in our Del Frisco\u2019s Double Eagle concept is derived from business customers using expense accounts, and our business therefore may be affected by reduced expense account or other business-related dining by our business clientele. If business clientele were to dine less frequently at our restaurants, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected as a result of a reduction in customer traffic or average revenues per customer.\nThere is also a risk that if uncertain or depressed economic conditions persist for an extended period of time, consumers might make long-lasting changes to their discretionary spending behavior, including dining out less frequently. Difficult economic conditions and recessionary periods may have an adverse impact on our business and our financial condition. Negative economic conditions, coupled with high volatility and uncertainty as to the future global economic landscape, have at times had a negative effect on consumers' discretionary income and consumer confidence and similar impacts can be expected should such conditions recur. A decrease in discretionary spending due to decreases in consumer confidence in the economy, or a continued economic slowdown or deterioration in the economy, could adversely affect our business and cause us to, among other things, reduce the number and frequency of new restaurant openings, close restaurants and delay our re-modeling of existing locations.\nIf our restaurants are not able to compete successfully with other restaurants, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur industry is intensely competitive with respect to price, quality of service, restaurant location, ambiance of facilities and type and quality of food. A substantial number of national and regional restaurant chains and independently owned restaurants compete with us for customers, restaurant locations and qualified management and other restaurant staff. Our concepts also compete with additional restaurants in the broader upscale and experiential dining segment. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources, have been in business longer, have greater name recognition and are better established in the markets where our restaurants are located or where we may expand. Our inability to compete successfully with other restaurants may harm our ability to maintain acceptable levels of revenue growth, limit or otherwise inhibit our ability to grow one or more of our concepts, or force us to close one or more of our restaurants. We may also need to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular new restaurant formats or concepts that emerge from time to time, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in doing so or that any changes we make to any of our concepts in response will be successful or not adversely affect our profitability. In addition, with improving product offerings at fast casual restaurants and casual dining restaurants combined with the effects of uncertain economic conditions and other factors, consumers may choose less expensive alternatives, which could also negatively affect customer traffic at our restaurants. Any unanticipated slowdown in demand at any of our restaurants due to industry competition may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur future growth depends in part on our ability to open new restaurants and operate them profitably, and if we are unable to successfully execute this strategy, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur financial success depends in part on management\u2019s ability to execute our growth strategy. One key element of our growth strategy is opening new restaurants. In fiscal 2018, we opened three Double Eagle restaurants at Back Bay in Boston, Massachusetts, Atlanta, Georgia and San Diego, California, three bartaco restaurants, post Barteca Acquisition, in North Hills, North Carolina, Fort Point, Massachusetts and Dallas, Texas, and three Grille restaurants in Westwood, Massachusetts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In fiscal 2019, we expect to open one Double Eagle restaurant, two to three Barcelona restaurants and three to four bartaco restaurants. We typically target an average cash investment of approximately $8.0 million to $9.0 million for a new Double Eagle, $3.1 million to $3.5 million for a new Barcelona, $2.5 million to $3.0 million for a new bartaco, and $5.0 million to $6.0 million for a new Grille restaurant, in each case net of landlord contributions and equipment financing and excluding pre-opening costs.\nOur ability to open new restaurants and operate them profitably is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nfinding quality site locations, competing effectively to obtain quality site locations and reaching acceptable agreements to lease or purchase sites;\n\u2022\ncomplying with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations and obtaining, for an acceptable cost, required permits and approvals;\n\u2022\nhaving adequate capital for construction and opening costs and efficiently managing the time and resources committed to building and opening each new restaurant;\n\u2022\ntimely hiring, training and retaining the skilled management and other employees necessary to meet staffing needs;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully promoting our new locations and competing in their markets;\n\u2022\nacquiring food and other supplies for new restaurants from local suppliers; and\n\u2022\naddressing unanticipated problems or risks that may arise during the development or opening of a new restaurant or entering a new market.\nA new restaurant typically experiences a \u201cramp-up\u201d period of approximately 18 to 36 months before it achieves our targeted level of performance. This is due to the costs associated with opening a new restaurant, as well as higher operating costs caused by start-up and other temporary inefficiencies associated with opening new restaurants. For example, there are a number of factors which may impact the amount of time and money we commit to the construction and development of new restaurants, including landlord delays, shortages of skilled labor, labor disputes, shortages of materials, delays in obtaining necessary permits, local government regulations and weather interference. Once the restaurant is open, how quickly it achieves a desired level of profitability is impacted by many factors, including the level of market familiarity and acceptance when we enter new markets, as well as the availability of experienced staff and the time required to negotiate reasonable prices for services and other supplies from local suppliers. Our business and profitability may be adversely affected if the \u201cramp-up\u201d period for a new restaurant lasts longer than we expect.\nWe have incurred substantial expenses related to the completion of the Barteca Acquisition, and we expect to incur additional expenses in connection with the integration of Barteca\u2019s business with our existing business.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, a number of non-recurring costs associated with the Barteca Acquisition and combining the operations of the two companies. The substantial majority of non-recurring expenses will be comprised of transaction costs related to the Barteca Acquisition.\nWe will also incur costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred as the integration progresses. We expect to implement the integration process gradually over time, and although we expect that the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses should allow us to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all, or we may incur other costs in our operations that offset all or a portion of such cost synergies.\nCombining Barteca\u2019s business with ours may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the Barteca Acquisition may not be realized.\nBarteca operates two highly differentiated brands, Barcelona Wine Bar and bartaco. The success of the Barteca Acquisition, including anticipated synergies and other benefits, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate our business with the business of Barteca. The Barteca Acquisition will involve the integration of Barteca\u2019s business with our existing business, which is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. The integration could result in material challenges, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the devotion of management\u2019s attention to the Barteca Acquisition;\n\u2022\nmanaging a larger combined company;\n\u2022\nmaintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process;\n\u2022\nretaining existing business and operational relationships and attracting new business and operational relationships;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses;\n\u2022\nconsolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations and inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically separate organizations and addressing possible differences in corporate culture and philosophies;\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues in integrating information technology, accounting, communications and other systems; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen expenses or delays associated with the integration of Barteca.\nMany of these factors will be outside of the combined company\u2019s control and any one of them could result in delays, increased costs, decreases in revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could materially affect the combined company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits of the Barteca Acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, the actual cost savings of the Barteca Acquisition could be less than anticipated.\nWe obtained financing to complete the Barteca Acquisition, which could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility, and may increase our interest expense.\nIn order to finance the Barteca Acquisition we entered into the 2018 Credit Facility, which provides for senior secured term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $390.0 million and senior secured revolving credit commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million. The amount and terms of the 2018 Credit Facility could affect our credit rating and our ability to obtain other financing, including through public or institutional markets. While there is no financial maintenance covenant in the term loans under the 2018 Credit Facility, the 2018 Credit Facility includes other customary affirmative and negative covenants. The failure to meet such restrictive covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations and adversely and materially affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition, as well as adversely affect our liquidity and the value of our shares of common stock. The ability of us and our subsidiaries to comply with such provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Any material increase in interest expense could possibly have a material impact on our ability to execute our strategies.\nTo manage interest rate increase risk we have entered into an interest rate cap to mitigate the impact of LIBOR variability on interest expense for a portion of our variable rate debt. The interest rate cap has been designated as a cash flow hedge. At December 25, 2018, we had an interest rate cap with a notional value of $200.0 million and 3% per annum strike rate to hedge the variability in the monthly 1-month LIBOR interest payments on a portion of our Term Loan Facility beginning July 31, 2018, through the expiration of the interest rate cap on June 30, 2022.\nOn August 6, 2018, we received $97.8 million of proceeds from a public offering of common stock that were used to repay a portion of the $390.0 million of the Term Loan B pursuant to an existing prepayment option.\nOn August 27, 2018 we amended the Term Loan B. The First Amendment amends the 2018 Credit Facility, to, among other things, completely re-syndicate the Amended Term Loan B, and provide the Company with additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $18.0 million. The First Amendment also amended the 2018 Credit Facility to increase the interest rate applicable to the Additional Term Loans and the existing term loans outstanding under the 2018 Credit Facility to, at our option, a rate per annum equal to either a LIBOR or ABR rate, plus an applicable margin, which is equal to 6.00% for LIBOR loans and 5.00% for ABR loans.\nThe amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness levels following completion of the Barteca Acquisition, and thus the demands on our cash resources, will be much greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness prior to the Barteca Acquisition. The increased levels of indebtedness following completion of the Barteca Acquisition will also reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, the repayment or refinancing of our indebtedness as it becomes due and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels.\nMoreover, in the future we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, the repayment or refinancing of our indebtedness, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements. Our ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nThe future results of the combined company may be adversely impacted if the combined company does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the completion of the Barteca Acquisition.\nFollowing the completion of the Barteca Acquisition, the size of the combined company\u2019s business became significantly larger than the current size of either our or Barteca\u2019s respective businesses. The combined company\u2019s ability to successfully manage this expanded business will depend, in part, upon management\u2019s ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the integration of two discrete companies in different geographic locations, but also the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances that the combined company will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the Barteca Acquisition.\nUncertainties associated with the Barteca Acquisition may cause the departure of management personnel and other key employees, which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company.\nWe are dependent upon the experience and industry knowledge of our respective officers and other key employees to execute our respective business plans. The combined company\u2019s success after the Barteca Acquisition will depend in part upon the ability of Del Frisco\u2019s to retain key management personnel and other key employees. Current and prospective employees of Del Frisco\u2019s may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company, which may materially adversely affect the ability of Del Frisco\u2019s to attract and retain key personnel after the acquisition which could adversely impact operations of the combined company.\nIf we are unable to increase our sales or maintain our margins at existing restaurants, our profitability and overall results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAnother key aspect of our growth strategy is increasing comparable restaurant sales and maintaining restaurant-level margins. Improving comparable restaurant sales and maintaining restaurant-level margins depends in part on whether we achieve revenue growth through increases in the average check and further expand our private dining business at each restaurant. We believe there are opportunities to increase the average check at our restaurants through, for example, selective introduction of higher priced items and increases in menu pricing. We also believe that expanding and enhancing our private dining capacity will also increase our restaurant sales, as our private dining business typically has a higher average check and higher overall margins than regular dining room business. However, these strategies may prove unsuccessful, especially in times of economic hardship, as customers may not order or enjoy higher priced items and discretionary spending on private dining events may decrease. Select price increases have not historically adversely impacted customer traffic; however, we expect that there is a price level at which point customer traffic would be adversely affected. It is also possible that these changes could cause our sales volume to decrease. If we are not able to increase our sales at existing restaurants for any reason, our profitability and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe failure to successfully accelerate development of our Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse concept could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operated 16 Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse locations as of the end of fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2017, we began accelerating development of the Del Frisco's Double Eagle concept, and plan to annually open two to three restaurants. Our ability to execute this initiative will require significant capital expenditures and management attention. If the \u201cramp-up\u201d period for one or more of the new Del Frisco's Double Eagle restaurants does not meet our expectations, our operating results may be adversely affected. In addition, we are targeting restaurant-level EBITDA margins of between 24% to 27% for the Del Frisco's Double Eagle concept. However, because we face new challenges at the Del Frisco's Double Eagle restaurants as we enter new markets, our operating margins may not reach these levels, requiring us to take action, including possible changes to our pricing and menu offering strategies, and we may not be successful in recouping our increased investments in the concept. We may not be able to attract enough customers to meet targeted levels of performance at new restaurants because potential customers may be unfamiliar with our concept or the atmosphere or menu might not appeal to them. In addition, opening a new Del Frisco's Double Eagle restaurant in one of our existing markets could reduce the revenue of our existing restaurants in that market. If we cannot successfully execute our growth strategies for the Del Frisco's Double Eagle concept, or if customer traffic generated by a Del Frisco's Double Eagle restaurant results in a decline in customer traffic at one of our other restaurants in the same market, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur growth, including the continued development of the Del Frisco's Double Eagle concept, as well as recently acquired Barcelona and bartaco concepts, may strain our infrastructure and resources, which could delay the opening of new restaurants and adversely affect our ability to manage our existing restaurants.\nWe plan to continue new restaurant growth, including the continued development and promotion of the Del Frisco's Double Eagle, Barcelona and bartaco concepts. We believe there are opportunities to open eight to twelve new restaurants annually, generally composed of two to three Double Eagle restaurants, two to three Barcelona restaurants and four to six for bartaco restaurants, which will serve as the primary driver of new unit growth in the near term. During fiscal 2019, we expect to open one Double Eagle restaurant, two to three Barcelona restaurants and three to four bartaco restaurants. We typically target an average cash investment of approximately $8.0 million to $9.0 million for a new Double Eagle, $3.1 million to $3.5 million for a new Barcelona, $2.5 million to $3.0 million for a new bartaco restaurant, in each case net of landlord contributions and equipment financing and excluding pre-opening costs. This growth and these investments will increase our operating complexity and place increased demands on our management as well as our human resources, purchasing and site management teams. While we have committed significant resources to expanding our current restaurant management systems, financial and management controls and information systems in connection with our recent growth, if this infrastructure is insufficient to support this expansion, our ability to open new restaurants, including the continued development and promotion of the Double Eagle, Barcelona and bartaco, and to manag\ne our existing restaurants, including the expansion of our private dining business, would be adversely affected. If we fail to continue to improve our infrastructure or if our improved infrastructure fails, we may be unable to implement our growth strategies or maintain current levels of operating performance in our existing restaurants.\nOur New York Del Frisco\u2019s Double Eagle location represents a significant portion of our revenues, and any significant downturn in its business or disruption in the operation of this location could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur New York Del Frisco\u2019s Double Eagle location represented approximately 10%, 11% and 11% of our revenues in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Accordingly, we are susceptible to any fluctuations in the business at our New York Double Eagle location, whether as a result of adverse economic conditions, negative publicity, changes in customer preferences or for other reasons. In addition, any natural disaster, prolonged inclement weather, act of terrorism or national emergency, accident, system failure or other unforeseen event in or around New York City could result in a temporary or permanent closing of this location, could influence potential customers to avoid this geographic region or this location in particular or otherwise lead to a decrease in revenues. Any significant interruption in the operation of this location or other reduction in sales could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nNegative customer experiences or negative publicity surrounding our restaurants or other restaurants could adversely affect sales in one or more of our restaurants and make our brands less valuable.\nThe quality of our food and our restaurant facilities are two of our competitive strengths. Therefore, adverse publicity, whether or not accurate, relating to food quality, public health concerns, illness, safety, injury or government or industry findings concerning our restaurants, restaurants operated by other food service providers or others across the food industry supply chain could affect us more than it would other restaurants that compete primarily on price or other factors. An unrelated restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky has the right to use, and uses, a specific registration of the Del Frisco\u2019s name pursuant to a concurrent use agreement, as described in greater detail in \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d. We do not own or control the Louisville restaurant, but any adverse publicity relating to those operations could negatively affect us. In addition, although we would not be legally liable for any such failure, because the Louisville restaurant operates under one of our brand names, we may be subject to litigation as a result of the restaurant\u2019s failure to comply with food quality, preparation or other applicable rules and regulations. If customers perceive or experience a reduction in our food quality, service or ambiance or in any way believe we have failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, the value and popularity of one or more of our concepts could suffer.\nNegative publicity relating to food safety and food-borne illnesses, could result in reduced consumer demand for our menu offerings, which could reduce sales.\nInstances of food-borne illness, including Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, which is also known as BSE or mad cow disease, aphthous fever, which is also known as hoof and mouth disease, as well as hepatitis A, listeria, salmonella and e-coli, whether or not found in the United States or traced directly to one of our suppliers or our restaurants, could reduce demand for our menu offerings. Any negative publicity relating to these and other health-related matters, such as the confirmation of a case of mad cow disease in a dairy cow in California in April 2012, may affect consumers\u2019 perceptions of our restaurants and the food that we offer, reduce customer visits to our restaurants and negatively impact demand for our menu offerings. Adverse publicity relating to any of these matters, beef in general or other similar concerns could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIncreases in the prices of, and/or reductions in the availability of commodities, primarily beef, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs, which have a substantial effect on our total costs. For example, we purchase large quantities of beef, particularly USDA prime beef. Our beef costs represented approximately 23%, 32% and 32% of our food and beverage costs during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and we currently do not purchase beef pursuant to any long-term contractual arrangements with fixed pricing or use futures contracts or other financial risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to potential price fluctuations. The market for USDA prime beef is particularly volatile and is subject to price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts, climate conditions, the price of feed, industry demand, energy demand and other factors. Although we currently do not engage in futures contracts or other financial risk management strategies with respect to potential price fluctuations, from time to time, we may opportunistically enter into fixed price beef supply contracts or contracts for other food products or consider other risk management strategies with regard to our meat and other food costs to minimize the impact of potential price fluctuations. This practice could help stabilize our food costs during times of fluctuating prices, although there can be no assurances that this will occur. However, because our restaurants feature USDA prime beef, we generally expect to purchase beef even if we have not entered into any such arrangements and the price increased significantly. The prices of other commodities can affect our costs as well, including corn and other grains, which are ingredients we use regularly and are also used as cattle feed and therefore affect the price of beef. Energy prices can also affect our bottom line, as increased energy prices may cause increased transportation costs for beef and other supplies, as well as increased costs\nfor the utilities required to run each restaurant. Historically we have passed increased commodity and other costs on to our customers by increasing the prices of our menu items. While we believe these price increases did not historically affect our customer traffic, there can be no assurance additional price increases would not affect future customer traffic. If prices increase in the future and we are unable to anticipate or mitigate these increases, or if there are shortages for USDA Prime beef, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe depend upon frequent deliveries of food and other supplies, in most cases from a limited number of suppliers, which subjects us to the possible risks of shortages, interruptions and price fluctuations.\nOur ability to maintain consistent quality throughout our restaurants depends in part upon our ability to acquire fresh products, including USDA prime beef, fresh seafood, quality produce and related items from reliable sources in accordance with our specifications. In addition, we rely on one or a limited number of suppliers for certain ingredients. For example, Stock Yards, a division of U.S. Foods, Inc., is the primary supplier of the beef for most of our restaurants and has been since June 2009. This dependence on one or a limited number of suppliers, as well as the limited number of alternative suppliers of USDA prime beef and quality seafood, subjects us to the possible risks of shortages, interruptions and price fluctuations in beef and seafood. If any of our suppliers is unable to obtain financing necessary to operate its business or its business is otherwise adversely affected, does not perform adequately or otherwise fails to distribute products or supplies to our restaurants, or terminates or refuses to renew any contract with us, particularly with respect to one of the suppliers on which we rely heavily for specific ingredients, we may be unable to find an alternative supplier in a short period of time or if we can, it may not be on acceptable terms. Our inability to replace our suppliers in a short period of time on acceptable terms could increase our costs or cause shortages at our restaurants that may cause us to remove certain items from a menu, increase the price of certain offerings or temporarily close a restaurant, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on the services of key executives, and our business and growth strategy could be materially harmed if we were to lose these executives and were unable to replace them with and successfully transition to executives of equal experience and capabilities.\nSome of our senior executives, such as Norman J. Abdallah, our Chief Executive Officer, are particularly important to our success. Senior executives are important to our business because they have been instrumental in setting our strategic direction, operating our business, identifying, recruiting and training key personnel, identifying expansion opportunities and arranging necessary financing. We have employment agreements with all members of senior management; however, we cannot prevent our executives from terminating their employment with us. Losing the services of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business until a suitable replacement could be found. We also believe that they could not quickly be replaced with executives of equal experience and capabilities and their successors may not be as effective. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our executives.\nChanges in consumer preferences and discretionary spending patterns could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nThe restaurant industry is characterized by the continual introduction of new concepts and is subject to rapidly changing consumer preferences, tastes and eating and purchasing habits. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences, as well as other factors affecting the restaurant industry, including new market entrants and demographic changes. Shifts in consumer preferences away from upscale steakhouses or beef, which is a significant component of our Del Frisco\u2019s Double Eagle concepts\u2019 menus and appeal, whether as a result of economic, competitive or other factors, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nRestaurant companies, including ours, have been the target of class action lawsuits and other proceedings alleging, among other things, violations of federal and state workplace and employment laws. Proceedings of this nature, if successful, could result in our payment of substantial damages.\nIn recent years, we and other restaurant companies have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. Similar lawsuits have been instituted from time to time alleging violations of various federal and state wage and hour laws regarding, among other things, employee meal deductions, the sharing of tips amongst certain employees, overtime eligibility of assistant managers and failure to pay for all hours worked.\nOccasionally, our customers file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to one of our restaurants, including actions seeking damages resulting from food-borne illness and relating to notices with respect to chemicals contained in food products required under state law. We are also subject to a variety of other claims from third parties arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims and claims alleging violations of federal and state laws. In addition, our restaurants are subject to state \u201cdram shop\u201d or similar laws\nwhich generally allow a person to sue us if that person was injured by a legally intoxicated person who was wrongfully served alcoholic beverages at one of our restaurants. The restaurant industry has also been subject to a growing number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of certain of their customers.\nRegardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations. In addition, they may generate negative publicity, which could reduce customer traffic and sales. Although we maintain what we believe to be adequate levels of insurance, insurance may not be available at all or in sufficient amounts to cover any liabilities with respect to these or other matters. A judgment or other liability in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims or any adverse publicity resulting from claims could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to substantial government regulation.\nOur business is subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulation, including regulations related to the preparation and sale of food, the sale of alcoholic beverages, the sale and use of tobacco, zoning and building codes, land use and employee, health, sanitation and safety matters. For example, the preparation, storing and serving of food and the use of certain ingredients is subject to heavy regulation. Alcoholic beverage control regulations govern various aspects of our restaurants\u2019 daily operations, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing and inventory control, handling and storage. Typically, our restaurants\u2019 licenses to sell alcoholic beverages must be renewed annually and may be suspended or revoked at any time for cause. In addition, because we operate in a number of different states, we are also required to comply with a number of different laws covering the same topics. The failure of any of our restaurants to timely obtain and maintain necessary governmental approvals, including liquor or other licenses, permits or approvals required to serve alcoholic beverages or food could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant or prevent regular day-to-day operations, including the sale of alcoholic beverages, at a restaurant that is already operating, any of which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, the costs of operating our restaurants may increase if there are changes in laws governing minimum hourly wages, working conditions, overtime and tip credits, health care, workers\u2019 compensation insurance rates, unemployment tax rates, sales taxes or other laws and regulations such as those governing access for the disabled, including the Americans with Disabilities Act. For example, the Federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, which was enacted on March 23, 2010, among other things, includes guaranteed coverage requirements and imposes new taxes on health insurers and health care benefits that could increase the costs of providing health benefits to employees. In addition, because we have a significant number of restaurants located in certain states, regulatory changes in these states could have a disproportionate impact on our business. If any of the foregoing increased costs and we were unable to offset the change by increasing our menu prices or by other means, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nGovernment regulation can also affect customer traffic at our restaurants. A number of states, counties and cities have enacted menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to disclose certain nutritional information. For example, the PPACA establishes a uniform, federal requirement for restaurant chains with 20 or more locations operating under the same trade name and offering substantially the same menus to post nutritional information on their menus, including the total number of calories. The law also requires such restaurants to provide to consumers, upon request, a written summary of detailed nutritional information, including total calories and calories from fat, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrates, complex carbohydrates, sugars, dietary fiber, and total protein in each serving size or other unit of measure, for each standard menu item. The FDA is also permitted to require additional nutrient disclosures, such as trans-fat content. In 2015, our Grille concept became subject to the requirements to post nutritional information on our menus and, based on current strategic outlook, our Double Eagle, Barcelona and bartaco concepts may become subject to these requirements in the near future. The FDA compliance deadline was May 7, 2018. We intend to comply with these requirements to the extent required for all concepts. Our compliance with the PPACA or other similar laws to which we may become subject could reduce demand for our menu offerings, reduce customer traffic and/or reduce average revenue per customer, which would have an adverse effect on our revenue. Any reduction in customer traffic related to these or other government regulations could affect revenues and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nTo the extent that governmental regulations impose new or additional obligations on our suppliers, including, without limitation, regulations relating to the inspection or preparation of meat, food and other products used in our business, product availability could be limited and the prices that our suppliers charge us could increase. We may not be able to offset these costs through increased menu prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If any of our restaurants were unable to serve particular food products, even for a short period of time, or if we are unable to offset increased costs, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nLabor shortages or changes to wage laws could harm our business.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including restaurant managers, kitchen staff and servers, necessary to keep pace with our anticipated expansion schedule and meet the needs of our existing restaurants. A sufficient number of qualified individuals of the requisite caliber to fill these positions may be in short supply in some communities. Competition in these communities for qualified staff could require us to pay higher wages and provide greater benefits. Any inability to recruit and retain qualified individuals may also delay the planned openings of new restaurants and could adversely impact our existing restaurants. Any such inability to retain or recruit qualified employees, increased costs of attracting qualified employees or delays in restaurant openings could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, we have a substantial number of hourly employees who are paid wage rates at or based on the federal or state minimum wage and who rely on tips as a large portion of their income. Any changes in the city, state, or federal laws affecting the wages we pay our employees, including an increase in the minimum wage, such as the 5% increase in the minimum wage on January 1, 2018 in California to $11.00, could increase our costs and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Certain other states in which we operate restaurants have adopted or are considering adopting minimum wage statutes that exceed the federal minimum wage as well. We may be unable or unwilling to increase our prices in order to pass these increased labor costs on to our customers, in which case, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe occupy most of our restaurants under long-term non-cancelable leases for which we may remain obligated to perform under even after a restaurant closes, and we may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms.\nAll of our restaurants are located in leased premises. Many of our current leases are non-cancelable and typically have initial terms ranging from 5 to 15 years with two to four 5-year extension options. We believe that leases that we enter into in the future will be on substantially similar terms. If we were to close or fail to open a restaurant at a location we lease, we would generally remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, which could include, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. For example, in fiscal year 2018, we paid $26.9 million, in fiscal 2017, we paid $20.7 million, and in fiscal 2016, we paid $18.2 million. Our obligation to continue making rental payments and fulfilling other lease obligations in respect of leases for closed or unopened restaurants could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Alternatively, at the end of the lease term and any renewal period for a restaurant, we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost, if at all. If we cannot renew such a lease we may be forced to close or relocate a restaurant, which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks. If we are required to make payments or otherwise perform under one of our leases after a restaurant closes or if we are unable to renew our restaurant leases, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAdverse weather conditions and natural disasters could adversely affect our restaurant sales.\nAdverse weather conditions can impact guest traffic at our restaurants, cause the temporary underutilization of outdoor patio seating and, in more severe cases such as hurricanes, tornadoes, severe winter storms or other natural disasters, may cause temporary closures, sometimes for prolonged periods, which would negatively impact our restaurant sales. Changes in weather could result in construction delays, interruptions to the availability of utilities, and shortages or interruptions in the supply chain of our restaurants, which could increase our costs. Some climatologists predict that the long-term effects of climate change and global warming may result in more severe, volatile weather or extended droughts, which could increase the frequency and duration of weather impacts on our operations, especially to our restaurants located in coastal cities where flooding occurs more frequently due to severe weather. Further, according to the U.S. Global Change Research Program Climate Science Special Report, heavy rainfall has been increasing in intensity and frequency across the United States and globally and is expected to continue to increase. The largest observed changes in the United States have occurred in the Northeast, where we have a large concentration of restaurant locations.\nThe impact of negative economic factors, including the availability of credit, on our landlords and other retail center tenants could negatively affect our financial results.\nNegative effects on our existing and potential landlords due to any inaccessibility of credit and other unfavorable economic factors may, in turn, adversely affect our business and results of operations. If our landlords are unable to obtain financing or remain in good standing under their existing financing arrangements, they may be unable to provide construction contributions or satisfy other lease covenants to us. If any landlord files for bankruptcy protection, the landlord may be able to reject our lease in the bankruptcy proceedings. While we would have the option to retain our rights under the lease, we could not compel the landlord to perform any of its obligations and would be left with damages as our sole recourse. In addition, if our landlords are unable to obtain sufficient credit to continue to properly manage their retail sites, we may experience a drop in the level of quality of such retail centers. Our development of new restaurants may also be adversely affected by the negative financial situations of developers and potential landlords.\nOur inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nSocial media continues to grow in importance as a tool for brands to engage with guests, but also opens companies up to risk. As active users continue to increase on these platforms and communication forums broaden the opportunities for guest engagement, there is less control over user generated messaging on social platforms. Social platforms allow subscribers and participants to post frequently, immediately and often without filters or accuracy checks. Even with the best monitoring, brands may not always realize when inaccurate or misleading information has been shared or be able to combat it when discovered. Depending on the information shared, effects can be significant and immediate to our business with field team members, guests, prospects, financial condition and operations. Effects could include increased costs, litigation, negative effects on reputation, exposure of proprietary or personally identifiable information and inaccurate data. To help mitigate risk on social media, our team is constantly innovating how we use and monitor our social platforms to drive awareness, engagement and loyalty to our brands. We have developed social media strategies across all brands that are structured to engage with our customers, tell our brand story and inspire positive and constructive dialogue. Through our marketing efforts, we work on a variety of social media platforms as well as paid digital advertising and search engine marketing to attract and retain guests. The success of these marketing initiatives is never guaranteed as social media is always changing and bringing forth unexpected content. The inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.\nFixed rental payments account for a significant portion of our operating expenses, which increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and could limit our operating and financing flexibility.\nPayments under our operating leases account for a significant portion of our operating expenses, and we expect the new restaurants we open in the future will similarly be leased by us. Specifically, payments under our operating leases accounted for 14.1%, 14.7% and 14.1% of our restaurant operating expenses in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our available cash flow to be applied to our rental obligations, thus reducing cash available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or the industry in which we compete; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a disadvantage with respect to some of our competitors.\nWe depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease obligations and to fulfill our other cash needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from borrowings under our credit facility or other sources, we may not be able to meet our operating lease obligations, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAny future indebtedness we may incur may limit our operational and financing flexibility and negatively impact our business.\nOn June 27, 2018, in connection with the completion of the Barteca Acquisition, we entered into the 2018 Credit Facility, which provides for senior secured term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $390.0 million and senior secured revolving credit commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million. At December 25, 2018, we had $323.8 million of outstanding borrowings on the Company\u2019s long-term debt. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Our credit facility, and other debt instruments we may enter into in the future, may have important consequences to us, including the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we use a significant portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest on any outstanding indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available to us for operations and other purposes; and\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited.\nWe expect that we will depend primarily on cash generated by our operations for funds to pay our expenses and any amounts due under our credit facility and any other indebtedness we may incur. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, and our currently anticipated growth in revenues and cash flows may not be realized, either or both of which could result in our being unable to repay indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. If we do not have enough money, we may be required to refinance all or part of our then existing debt, sell assets\nor borrow more money, in each case on terms that are not acceptable to us. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements, including our existing credit facility, may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our ability to recapitalize and incur additional debt in the future could also delay or prevent a change in control of our company, make some transactions more difficult and impose additional financial or other covenants on us. In addition, any significant levels of indebtedness in the future could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt and could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business. Our indebtedness and any inability to pay our debt obligations as they come due or inability to incur additional debt could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe terms of our credit facility impose operating and financial restrictions on us.\nOur credit facility contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative covenants and negative covenants, that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens on assets, make investments, sell assets, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations, pay dividends and other restricted payments and prepay junior debt. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio as set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including payment defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency, the occurrence of a change of control, inaccuracy of representations and warranties and breaches of covenants under the Credit Agreement, subject to customary grace periods. Upon occurrence of an event of default, the majority lenders (or the majority of revolving lenders in case of the financial covenant) may terminate the commitments under the Credit Agreement, declare any then-outstanding loans due and payable and exercise other customary remedies.\nOur credit facility limits our ability to engage in these types of transactions even if we believed that a specific transaction would contribute to our future growth or improve our operating results. As of December 25, 2018, our credit facility also requires us to have a leverage ratio of less than 6.00. As of December 25, 2018, we were in compliance with this test. See Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. A breach of any of these provisions or our inability to comply with required financial ratios in our credit facility could result in a default under the credit facility in which case the lenders will have the right to declare all borrowings to be immediately due and payable. If we are unable to repay all borrowings when due, whether at maturity or if declared due and payable following a default, the lenders would have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to secure the indebtedness. If we breach these covenants or fail to comply with the terms of the credit facility and the lenders accelerate the amounts outstanding under the credit facility our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur credit facility carries floating interest rates, thereby exposing us to market risk related to changes in interest rates to the extent there are borrowings outstanding thereunder. Accordingly, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. A one percentage point change in interest rates would be expected to have an impact on pre-tax earnings and cash flows of approximately $10,000 per $1.0 million of outstanding debt under our credit facility, which would have been approximately $3.2 million less the impact of the hedge over the course of a full fiscal year. See Note 8 Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for disclosures on our derivative instrument and hedging activities.\nIt is unclear how increased regulatory oversight and changes in the method for determining LIBOR may affect the value of the financial obligations to be held or issued by us that are linked to LIBOR, or how such changes could affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nIn the recent past, concerns have been publicized that some of the member banks surveyed by British Bankers\u2019 Association, or the BBA, in connection with the calculation of LIBOR across a range of maturities and currencies may have been under-reporting or otherwise manipulating the inter-bank lending rate applicable to them in order to profit on their derivative positions or to avoid an appearance of capital insufficiency or adverse reputational or other consequences that may have resulted from reporting inter-bank lending rates higher than those they actually submitted. A number of BBA member banks entered into settlements with their regulators and law enforcement agencies with respect to alleged manipulation of LIBOR, and investigations by regulators and governmental authorities in various jurisdictions are ongoing.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time whether LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. As such, the potential effect of any such event on our net investment income cannot yet be determined. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by short term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate the credit agreements extending beyond 2021 with our portfolio companies that utilize LIBOR as a factor in\ndetermining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. In addition, any further changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe failure to enforce and maintain our intellectual property rights could enable others to use names confusingly similar to the names and marks used by our restaurants, which could adversely affect the value of our brands.\nWe have registered the names Del Frisco\u2019s Double Eagle Steakhouse, Barcelona Wine Bar, bartaco and Del Frisco\u2019s Grille and have applications pending to register certain other names and logos used by our restaurants as trade names, trademarks or service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in certain foreign countries. We have the exclusive right to use these trademarks throughout the United States, other than with respect to one restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky, and the 50 mile surrounding area, where an unrelated third party has the right to use a specific registration of the Del Frisco\u2019s name in Jefferson County in Kentucky. See Item 1, Business. The success of our business depends in part on our continued ability to utilize our existing trade names, trademarks and service marks as currently used in order to increase our brand awareness. In that regard, we believe that our trade names, trademarks and service marks are valuable assets that are critical to our success. The unauthorized use or other misappropriation of our trade names, trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and restaurant concepts and may cause a decline in our revenues and force us to incur costs related to enforcing our rights. In addition, the use of trade names, trademarks or service marks similar to ours in some markets may keep us from entering those markets. While we may take protective actions with respect to our intellectual property, these actions may not be sufficient to prevent, and we may not be aware of all incidents of, unauthorized usage or imitation by others. Any such unauthorized usage or imitation of our intellectual property, including the costs related to enforcing our rights, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nInformation technology system failures or breaches of our network security, including with respect to confidential information, could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.\nWe and our third party providers rely on our computer systems and network infrastructure across our operations, including point-of-sale processing at our restaurants. Our operations depend upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and systems against damage and disruption from physical theft, fire, power loss, computer and telecommunications failure, workplace wrongdoing, or other natural disasters and catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, viruses, worms, malware and other disruptive software and problems. Any damage or failure of our computer systems or network infrastructure or that of our third party providers that causes an interruption in our operations or theirs could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and subject us to damages, loses, litigation or actions by regulatory authorities.\nIn addition, because the majority of our restaurant sales are by credit or debit cards, our possession of confidential information may also put us at a greater risk of being targeted by hackers. In the normal course of our business, we have been the target of malicious cyber-attack attempts, and other restaurants and retailers have experienced security breaches in which credit and debit card information of their customers has been stolen. We may also be impacted by breaches of our third-party processors. If this or another type of breach occurs at one of our restaurants, we may become subject to negative publicity as well as lawsuits or other proceedings for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of our customers\u2019 credit or debit card information. Although no breaches have had a direct, material impact on us, we are unable to predict the direct or indirect impact of any future attacks to our business or that of our third party providers.\nIn addition, numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persistent cyber-attacks, phishing and social engineering schemes, particularly on internet applications, could compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of data in our systems. Although we employ both internal resources and external consultants to conduct auditing and testing for weaknesses in our systems, controls, firewalls and encryption and intend to maintain and upgrade our security technology and operational procedures to prevent such damage, breaches or other disruptive problems, there can be no assurance that these security measures and procedures will be successful to prevent, counter or otherwise minimize these threats. Any such claim, proceeding or action by a regulatory authority, or any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to disable or degrade systems change frequently, have become increasingly more complex and sophisticated, and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely. As these threats continue to evolve and increase, we may be required to devote significant additional resources in order to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\nWe expect to offer restricted stock and other forms of stock-based compensation in the future, which have the potential to dilute stockholder value and cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nAs of December 25, 2018, we had awards of stock options, restricted stock and performance stock units outstanding under our equity compensation plan. In addition, we expect to offer restricted stock and performance stock units and other forms of stock-based compensation to our directors, officers and employees in the future. If the options that we issue are exercised, or any restricted stock or other awards that we may issue vests, and those shares are sold into the public market, the market price of our common stock may decline. In addition, the availability of shares of common stock for award under our equity incentive plan, or the grant of restricted stock or other forms of stock-based compensation, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are a holding company and depend on the cash flow of our subsidiaries.\nWe are a holding company with no material assets other than the equity interests of our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets and intellectual property. Consequently, our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations and pay any future dividends to our stockholders depends upon the cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by our subsidiaries directly or indirectly to us in the form of dividends, distributions and other payments. Any inability on the part of our subsidiaries to make payments to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProvisions of our charter documents, Delaware law and other documents could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. For example, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\npermit us to issue without stockholder approval preferred stock in one or more series and, with respect to each series, fix the number of shares constituting the series and the designation of the series, the voting powers, if any, of the shares of the series and the preferences and other special rights, if any, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions, of the shares of the series;\n\u2022\nprevent stockholders from calling special meetings;\n\u2022\nprevent the ability of stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022\nlimit the ability of stockholders to amend our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022\nrequire advance notice for nominations for election to the board of directors and for stockholder proposals; and\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms.\nThese provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition of our company, including a transaction in which the acquiror may offer a premium price for our common stock.\nWe are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder, as defined in that section, for a period of three years following the date on which that stockholder became an interested stockholder. In addition, our equity incentive plan permits vesting of stock options, restricted stock and performance stock units, and payments to be made to the employees thereunder in certain circumstances, in connection with a change of control of our company, which could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.\nWe are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and, as a result, we are subject to increased disclosure and governance requirements.\nWe qualified as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, through the part of fiscal 2017. We are now an accelerated filer and, as such, we are subject to certain public company requirements that did not previously apply to us. These requirements include:\n\u2022\ncompliance with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nfull disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe expect that the loss of \u201cemerging growth company\u201d status and compliance with these additional requirements may substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly. In particular, we expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Failure to comply with these requirements could also subject us to enforcement actions by the SEC, further increase costs and divert management\u2019s attention, damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe have had a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting in the past and cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements which could require us to restate financial statements, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on our stock price.\nAs reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 26, 2017, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. We have remediated this material weakness, by implementing corrective measures as described in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 25, 2018.\nWe cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The existence of a material weakness or significant deficiency could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. For example, the FASB, together with the International Accounting Standards Board, has issued a comprehensive set of changes in accounting for leases. The lease accounting model is a \u201cright of use\u201d model that assumes that each lease creates an asset (the lessee\u2019s right to use the leased asset) and a liability (the future rent payment obligations), which should be reflected on a lessee\u2019s balance sheet to fairly represent the lease transaction and the lessee\u2019s related financial obligations. All of our restaurant leases are accounted for as operating leases, with no related assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. However, changes in lease accounting rules or their interpretation, or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance. Any such change could have a significant effect on our reported financial results.\nWe have recorded significant valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets, and the recording and release of such allowances may have a material impact on our results of operations and cause fluctuations in our stock price.\nThe need for a valuation allowance requires an assessment of the available positive and negative evidence at each balance sheet date to determine whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of existing deferred tax assets. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we entered a three year cumulative loss position and established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. As of December 25, 2018 the valuation allowance was $17.4 million.\nIn the future, we may release the valuation allowance and recognize deferred tax assets depending on achieving profitability. We continue to monitor the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. There can be no assurance that we will generate profits in future periods enabling us to fully realize our deferred tax assets. The timing of the reversal of such valuation allowance is subject to objective and subjective factors that cannot be readily predicted in advance. The reversal of a previously recorded valuation allowance may have a material impact on our financial results, which may lead to a fluctuation in the price of our stock.", "PERMNO": 13524, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "DFRG"}
