The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in interest rates and spreads could have an impact on earnings and results of operations.\nOur consolidated earnings and financial condition are dependent to a large degree upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned from loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The narrowing of interest rate spreads could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. We cannot predict with certainty or control changes in interest rates. Regional and local economic conditions and the policies of regulatory authorities, including monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, affect interest income and interest expense. While we have ongoing policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates, changes in interest rates still may have an adverse effect on our profitability. For example, high interest rates could affect the amount of loans that we can originate, because higher rates could cause customers to apply for fewer mortgages, or cause depositors to shift funds from accounts that have a comparatively lower cost to accounts with a higher cost, or experience customer attrition due to competitor pricing. If the cost of interest-bearing deposits increases at a rate greater than the yields on interest-earning assets increase, net interest income will be negatively affected. Changes in the asset and liability mix may also affect net interest income. Similarly, lower interest rates cause higher yielding assets to prepay and floating or adjustable rate assets to reset to lower rates. If we are not able to reduce our funding costs sufficiently, due to either competitive factors or the maturity schedule of existing liabilities, then our net interest margin will decline.\nWe operate in a highly-regulated environment that is subject to extensive government supervision and regulation, which may interfere with our ability to conduct business and may adversely impact the results of our operations. We are subject to extensive federal and state supervision and regulation that govern nearly all aspects of our operations and can have a material impact on our business. Financial regulatory authorities have significant discretion regarding the supervision, regulation and enforcement of banking laws and regulations.\nFinancial laws, regulations and policies are subject to amendment by Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. Changes to statutes, regulations or policies, including changes in the interpretation of regulations or policies, could materially impact our business. These changes could also impose additional costs on us and limit the types of products and services that we may offer our customers. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and the failure to comply with any law, regulation or policy could result in sanctions by financial regulatory agencies, including civil monetary penalties, private lawsuits, or reputational damage, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent such violations, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur. See the Section titled, \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in ITEM 1. Business.\nSince the 2008 global financial crisis, financial institutions have been subject to increased scrutiny from Congress, state legislatures and federal and state financial regulatory agencies. Recent changes to the legal and regulatory framework have significantly altered the laws and regulations under which we operate. These changes may reduce our ability to effectively compete in attracting and retaining customers. The passage and continued implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act, among other laws and regulations, has increased our costs of doing business and resulted in decreased revenues and net income. The Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations could also have adverse implications on the financial industry, the competitive environment and our ability to conduct business. Several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by the federal financial regulatory agencies. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that future changes in laws, regulations and policies will not adversely affect our business.\nState and federal regulatory agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including for compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we are or become subject as a result of such examinations may adversely affect our business.\nFederal and state regulatory agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, an agency were to determine that the financial, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or violates any law or regulation, such agency may take certain remedial or enforcement actions it deems appropriate to correct any deficiency. Remedial or enforcement actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced against a bank, to direct an increase in the bank\u2019s capital, to restrict the bank\u2019s growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against a bank\u2019s officers or directors, and to remove a bank\u2019s officers and directors. In the event that the FDIC concludes that, among other things, our financial conditions cannot be corrected or that there is an imminent risk of loss to our depositors, it may terminate our deposit insurance. The OCC, as the supervisory and regulatory authority for federal savings associations, has similar enforcement powers with respect to our business. The CFPB also has authority to take enforcement actions, including cease-and-desist orders or civil monetary penalties, if it finds that we offer consumer financial products and services in violation of federal consumer financial protection laws.\nIf we were unable to comply with future regulatory directives, or if we were unable to comply with the terms of any future supervisory requirements to which we may become subject, then we could become subject to a variety of supervisory actions and orders, including cease and desist orders, prompt corrective actions, MOUs, and other regulatory enforcement actions. Such supervisory actions could, among other things, impose greater restrictions on our business, as well as our ability to develop any new business. We could also be required to raise additional capital, or dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed time period, or both. Failure to implement remedial measures as required by financial regulatory agencies could result in additional orders or penalties from federal and state regulators, which could trigger one or more of the remedial actions described above. The terms of any supervisory action and associated consequences with any failure to comply with any supervisory action could have a material negative effect on our business, operating flexibility and overall financial condition.\nA breach of information security, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our business and impact our earnings.\nWe depend upon data processing, communication and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks, and over the internet. In addition, we rely on the services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs. Despite existing safeguards, we cannot be certain that all of our systems are free from vulnerability to attack or other technological difficulties or failures. If information security is breached or difficulties or failures occur, despite the controls we and our third-party vendors have instituted, information can be lost or misappropriated, resulting in financial loss or costs to us, reputational harm or damages to others. Such costs or losses could exceed the amount of insurance coverage, if any, which would adversely affect our earnings.\nChanges in local economic conditions may affect our business.\nOur current market area is principally located in Cheshire, Grafton, Hillsborough, Merrimack and Sullivan counties in central and western New Hampshire and in Rutland, Windsor and Orange counties in central Vermont. Future growth opportunities depend on the growth and stability of the regional economy and our ability to expand our market area. A downturn in the local economy may limit funds available for deposit and may negatively affect borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans on a timely basis, both of which could have an impact on our profitability and business.\nIncreases to the allowance for loan losses may cause our earnings to decrease.\nOur business is subject to periodic fluctuations based on national and local economic conditions. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled and may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition. The current economic uncertainty will more than likely affect employment levels and could impact the ability of our borrowers to service their debt. Bank regulatory agencies also periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, we may need, depending on an analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may suffer higher loan losses as a result of these factors and the resulting impact on our borrowers.\nStrong competition within our industry and market area could limit our growth and profitability.\nWe face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors. Future growth and success will depend on the ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive environment. We compete for deposits, loans and other financial services with a variety of banks, thrifts, credit unions and other financial institutions as well as other entities which provide financial services. Some of the financial institutions and financial services organizations with which we compete are not subject to the same degree of regulation. Many competitors have been in business for many years, have established customer bases, are larger, and have substantially higher lending limits. The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. These technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties.\nWe rely on dividends from the Bank for most of our revenue.\nWe receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from the Bank. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock and interest and principal on our debt. Federal laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to us. Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on our preferred or common stock. The inability to receive dividends from the Bank could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives\nof the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on our executive officers and key personnel to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nManagement believes that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part upon the skills of the management team. The competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry is intense, and the loss of key personnel or an inability to continue to attract, retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect the business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain existing key personnel or attract additional qualified personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers and key personnel could impair our ability to continue to develop our business strategy.\nThe risks presented by acquisitions could adversely affect our financial condition and result of operations.\nOur business strategy has included and may continue to include growth through acquisition from time to time. Any future acquisitions will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions. These risks may include, among other things: our ability to realize anticipated cost savings; the difficulty of integrating operations and personnel; the loss of key employees; the potential disruption of our or the acquired company\u2019s ongoing business in such a way that could result in decreased revenues; the inability of our management to maximize our financial and strategic position; the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; and the impairment of relationships with the acquired company\u2019s employees and customers as a result of changes in ownership and management.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks. A failure to successfully manage these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new lines of business, offer new products and services within existing lines of business or shift focus on our asset mix. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services and/or shifting focus of asset mix, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law and certain banking laws, could delay or prevent a takeover of us by a third party.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, the corporate law of the State of Delaware and state and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could delay, defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit to our stockholders, or otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock. These provisions include: supermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations; the election of directors to staggered terms of three years; and advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors and for proposing matters that stockholders may act on at stockholder meetings. In addition, we are subject to Delaware law, which among other things prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with any interested\nstockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met. These provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors other than candidates nominated by our Board of Directors.", "PERMNO": 10297, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "LSBG"}
