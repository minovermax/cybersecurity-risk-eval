RISK FACTORS\nThe following are significant factors known to us that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results predicted by forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements made by us are qualified by the risks described below. There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic conditions and other external factors may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur results of operations are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending. Consumer confidence, employment levels, interest rates, tax rates, housing market conditions, fuel and energy costs, and the availability of financing for our dealers and end consumers could reduce consumer spending, including discretionary spending on snowmobile and ATV/ROV industry products. Our future results could be significantly adversely impacted by these factors.\nOur products are subject to extensive federal and state safety, environmental and other government regulations that may require us to incur expenses or modify product offerings in order to maintain compliance with regulations.\nOur products are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to safety, environmental and other regulations promulgated by the U.S. and Canadian federal governments and individual states and provinces, as well as international regulatory authorities. Although we believe that our snowmobiles, ATVs and ROVs have always complied with applicable vehicle safety and emissions standards and related regulations, future regulations may require additional safety standards or emission reductions that would require additional expenses\nand/or modification of product offerings in order to maintain such compliance. We are unable to predict the ultimate impact of adopted or proposed regulations on our business and operating results.\nA significant adverse determination in any material product liability or intellectual property claim against us could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. Accidents involving personal injury and property damage may occur in the use of snowmobiles, ATVs and ROVs and claims have been made against us from time to time relating to these accidents. In addition, our products, and the products of our competitors, incorporate significant amounts of intellectual property developed by us and others and, from time to time, parties assert claims against us relating to their intellectual property. It is our policy to vigorously defend against these product liability and intellectual property claims. We have recorded a reserve based on our estimated range of potential exposures to the legal proceedings and claims of which we are aware. Should any judgment or settlement occur that exceeds our estimate, or a new claim arise, we may need to adjust our overall reserve and, depending on the amount, such adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.\nSignificant repair and/or replacement with respect to product warranty claims or product recalls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe provide a limited warranty on retail sales for a period of six months for our ATVs and ROVs and one year for our snowmobiles. We may provide longer warranties in certain geographical markets as determined by local regulations and market conditions, as well as related to certain promotional programs. Although we employ quality control procedures, sometimes a product is distributed that requires repair or replacement. Our standard warranties require us, through our dealers, to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumer. Historically, product recalls have been administered through our dealers and distributors and have not had a material effect on our business. However, the repair and replacement costs and potential harm to our reputation we could incur in connection with a recall could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur ability to remain competitive is contingent upon our capability, and ability, to develop and successfully introduce new, innovative and compliant products that respond to customer demands and preferences and achieve market acceptance.\nArctic Cat\u2019s growth strategy is to deliver the ultimate off-road riding experience for riders, workers and outdoor enthusiasts through product development and innovation to generate future revenue growth. Product development and improvement and new product innovation require significant research, planning, design, development, engineering, and testing at the technological product and manufacturing process levels, as well as considerable financial, technological, and other resources. Due to these substantial requirements, we may not be able to timely develop and introduce product improvements or new products. Our competitors\u2019 new products may beat our products to market, be higher quality or more reliable, be more effective with more features and/or less expensive than our products, obtain better market acceptance, or render our products obsolete. Further, any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on, among other things, existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising, marketing, promotional programs, and research and development. If we are unable to continue to enhance existing products and develop new innovative products, we may not be able to adequately compete with our competitors and ultimately satisfy the needs, demands, and preferences of our end customers.\nChanging weather conditions may reduce demand for certain of our products and negatively impact net sales.\nLack of snowfall in any year in particular regions of North America and Northern Europe may adversely impact snowmobile retail sales and related PG&A sales in that region. Lack of snowfall in a given year may also\nreduce overall industry demand, which could lead to increased promotional activity and lower future net sales. Weather conditions may materially affect our future sales of snowmobiles, ATVs, ROVs and PG&A.\nWe face intense competition in all product lines from competitors that have greater financial and marketing resources. Failure to compete effectively against competitors could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nThe snowmobile and ATV/ROV markets worldwide are highly competitive. Competition is based upon a number of factors, including performance, ride, suspension, innovation, technology, styling, fit and finish, brand loyalty, reliability, durability, price and distribution. At the dealer level, competition is based on a number of factors including sales and marketing support programs (such as sales incentives and cooperative advertising). Many of our competitors are more diversified and have financial and marketing resources that are substantially greater than ours. In addition, our products compete with other recreational products for the discretionary spending of consumers. If we are not able to effectively compete in this environment, our business and operating results could be negatively impacted.\nTermination or interruption of engine and other supply arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nIn the event that we need to obtain substitute supply arrangements for engine or other raw materials or components for which we rely upon limited sources of supply, alternate supply arrangements may not be available with comparable terms.\nFailure to establish and maintain the appropriate level of dealers and distributor relationships or weak economic conditions impacting those relationships may negatively impact our business and operating results.\nWe distribute our products through numerous dealers and distributors, and we rely on them to retail our products to the end customers. Our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected if deterioration of economic or business conditions results in a weakening of the financial condition of a material number of our dealers and distributors. Additionally, weak demand for, or quality issues with, our products may cause dealers and distributors to voluntarily or involuntarily reduce or terminate their relationship with us. Further, if we fail to establish and maintain an appropriate level of dealers and distributors for each of our products, we may not obtain adequate market coverage for the desired level of retail sales of our products.\nFluctuations in foreign currency rates could result in declines in our reported net sales and net earnings\nOur reported net sales and cost of goods sold are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. During fiscal 2016, sales to Canadian dealers that are denominated in Canadian dollars comprised 27.6% of total net sales. We utilized cash flow hedges to help mitigate the variability in Canadian exchange rate changes relating to Canadian dollar fund transfers to the United States. Sales to European on-road ATV dealers and distributors are made in Euros with the Euro serving as the functional currency. Sales to European on-road ATV dealers comprised 9.9% of total net sales in fiscal 2016. Approximately 8.7% of our total cost of goods sold was purchased from Japanese yen denominated suppliers during fiscal 2016. The majority of these purchases were made from Suzuki and Yamaha for engines for our snowmobiles. We have an agreement with Suzuki for snowmobile engine purchases to share the impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen above and below a fixed range contained in the agreement. A change in foreign currency exchange rates could materially affect our business and operating results.\nSecurity breaches, interruptions in their operation or other disruptions to our management information systems and data security could compromise sensitive information and expose us to a liability, which could adversely impact our operations, business, reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data within our internal data centers, cloud services and on our networks, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers,\nsuppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of proprietary business information and personally identifiable information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to malicious attacks or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions, including as a result of new systems rollouts or upgrades of existing systems. Any such breach, operational failure or difficulties encountered in the development of new systems or the upgrades of existing systems could compromise our networks and/or that of our partners and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could create financial liability, subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and/or cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business.\nInterruption of dealer floorplan financing could have a material impact on our business operations.\nWe have agreements with Wells Fargo Commercial Distribution Finance in the United States and Canada and, through June 2016, TCF Commercial Finance Canada in Canada to provide snowmobile, ATV and ROV floorplan financing for our North American dealers. These agreements improve our liquidity by financing dealer purchases of our products without requiring substantial use of our working capital. We are paid by the floorplan companies shortly after shipment and as part of our marketing programs, we pay the floorplan financing of our dealers for certain set time periods depending on the size of a dealer\u2019s order. While we expect to continue with our current dealer floorplan arrangements, these arrangements may not remain available or the costs and other terms of new financing arrangements may be significantly less favorable to us than have historically been available.\nTermination, interruption or nonrenewal of bank credit agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nThe seasonality of our snowmobile, ATV and ROV production cycles generates significant fluctuations in our working capital requirements during each year. Historically, we have financed our working capital requirements out of available cash balances at the beginning and end of the production cycle and with short-term bank borrowings during the middle of this cycle. While we expect to continue with our current multi-year working capital financing agreement from our lender, working capital financing arrangements may not remain available or the costs and other terms of new financing arrangements may be significantly less favorable to us than have historically been available. In addition, our current bank credit agreement contains covenants which we might be unable to meet in some future period requiring the need for waivers or alternate financing.\nIf we fail to attract, develop and retain qualified employees, including employees in key positions, our business and operating results may be harmed.\nOur performance is highly dependent on attracting and retaining qualified employees, including our senior management team and other key employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers and our ability to offer appropriate compensation and benefit packages. Our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals or failure to retain key employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities. In addition, a significant amount of turnover of employees with specific knowledge relating to us, our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations.\nFailure to effectively manage new business ventures, strategic alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business.\nFrom time to time, our strategy has involved, and may in the future involve, entering into new business ventures and strategic alliances, as well as making acquisitions. Assessing a potential opportunity can be based on assumptions that might not ultimately prove to be correct. In addition, the amount of information we can obtain about a potential opportunity may be limited, and we can give no assurance that new business ventures, strategic alliances and acquisitions will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned.\nThe success of these opportunities is also largely dependent on the current and future participation, working relationship and strategic vision of the business venture or strategic alliance partners, which can change following a transaction. Integrating new businesses can be a difficult task, and these types of transactions may divert our capital and our management\u2019s attention from other business issues and opportunities. We may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting and deficiencies in information technology systems in connection with the integration of an acquired company. If we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully, our business, reputation and operating results could suffer materially. Likewise, our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to impairment of the associated goodwill and intangible asset balances.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and prevent fraud.\nOur efforts to maintain our internal controls may not be successful, and we may be unable to maintain effective controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future and comply with the certification and reporting obligations under Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Any failure to maintain effective controls could result in material misstatements that are not prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis, which could potentially subject us to sanction or investigation by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and adversely affect our business and our stock price.", "PERMNO": 76207, "SIC": 3790, "TIC": "ACAT"}
