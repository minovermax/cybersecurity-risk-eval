{"cik": "815093", "company": "MGC DIAGNOSTICS Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-01-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur results are affected by changes in worldwide economic and capital markets conditions.\nWe derived 23.5% and 28.1% of our respective fiscal 2016 and 2015 revenues from outside the United States. Our business may be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other countries that are beyond our control, such as downturns in economic activity or labor conditions in a specific country or region.\nOur ownership and operation of Medisoft entails ownership of Euro-denominated assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and Dollar-Euro currency changes have adversely affected our results.\nWe incurred foreign currency losses of $46,000 and $929,000 in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. In the same two years, we also incurred foreign currency translation gains (losses) of $22,000 and $(149,000), which are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet. Our business may be adversely affected by Euro and other currency rate fluctuations against the US Dollar.\nIf we are unable to attain synergies from the acquisition of Medisoft, our sustained profitability may be uncertain.\nWe have made significant personnel and financial resource commitments for the acquisition and integration of Medisoft. Medisoft incurred losses of $4,510,000 and $999,000 in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. If we are unable to generate revenue growth and operational synergies from our continued efforts, our combined profitability and financial position may continue to be adversely affected.\nWe own significant inventory of a product that we are selling into the U.S. market for the first time, since only recently receiving FDA clearance.\nWe have entered into a distribution agreement under which we agreed to purchase and resell third-party products in markets that are adjacent to our core cardiorespiratory diagnostic products.\nIn 2012, we entered into an agreement with a European company under which we purchased forced oscillation technique (\u201cFOT\u2019) products for resale. As of October 31, 2016, we had FOT inventory with a carrying value of $0.5 million, after incurring impairment charges of $0.7 million in fiscal 2016 results. We have clearance to sell this product in Europe and we received FDA clearance to market and sell this product in the United States late in calendar year 2016, but we cannot ensure that we will be able to market and sell all of the units currently on hand. Although the FOT product is now authorized for sale in a number of countries, if we do not achieve sales levels sufficient to realize the carrying value of this inventory or if we are unable to extend or renew our contract to distribute this product with the manufacturer, we may be required to take an additional impairment charge against this inventory.\nWe are engaged in the orderly disposal of a sleep diagnostic product.\nIn March 2014, we entered into an agreement with Neurovirtual USA, Inc. (\u201cNeurovirtual\u201d) under which we agreed to purchase and sell Neurovirtual sleep diagnostics products. At October 31, 2016, we had an inventory of Neurovirtual sleep diagnostic products with a carrying value of $0.2 million after incurring impairment charges of $0.3 million as of October 31, 2016. On June 14, 2016, we settled litigation with Neurovirtual that resulted in the termination of the agreement and allowed us to continue selling this inventory, under full warranty according to the termination agreement. If we are unable to successfully resell the remaining inventory, we may be required to record an additional impairment charge against any remaining inventory.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could limit our ability to detect and prevent fraud and thereby adversely affect our business and stock price.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. Nevertheless, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the consolidated financial statement preparation and presentation. Our inability to maintain an effective control environment may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our stock price. The Company, while reviewing its internal controls noted a material weakness. See Item 9A for further details.\nWe have commenced litigation against the Medisoft selling shareholders.\nIn November 2015, we commenced litigation in the French-speaking courts of Brussels, Belgium against the Medisoft selling shareholders for violations of representations and warranties in the stock purchase agreement dated as of July 10, 2014 under which we purchased Medisoft. We alleged that these violations resulted in damages to us of approximately \u20ac985,400 ($1,084,000). In May 2015, we received payment of \u20ac406,700 ($447,000) with respect to these alleged violations pursuant to a bank-guaranteed contractual escrow fund and we have reflected that payment on our books and records. On May 30, 2016, the defendant selling shareholders filed an answer and asserted a counterclaim against us seeking to recover the \u20ac406,700 that was paid plus legal costs. We continue to believe the Medisoft selling shareholders are liable to us for violations of representations and warranties in the stock purchase agreement and continue to pursue this matter. We have not accrued any losses related to the litigation and have not accrued any related legal costs that we have not yet incurred. We expect that this litigation process in the Belgian courts may continue until the fall of 2017. Although we believe our claims against the Medisoft selling shareholders have merit, litigation is uncertain and can be expensive, particularly in a foreign jurisdiction. We cannot ensure that we will recover additional amounts against the Medisoft selling shareholders, and if we are unsuccessful, we may be required to return a portion of the payment we received. See Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings.\nWe have capitalized significant costs and expenses related to new software products.\nWe capitalize costs to develop new software products because these software products are an integral part of our diagnostic medical devices. We begin to capitalize costs related to new software development products once we have achieved technological feasibility and we have completed all research and development for the product\u2019s components. We amortize these software costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related product beginning when the product is available for general customer release. See \u201cIntangible Assets, Note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements.\u201d\nAt October 31, 2016, we had net book value for capitalized software development costs of $3.3 million, most of which is related to a new operating software platform for our cardiorespiratory diagnostic products that has not been placed into service. During fiscal 2016, we capitalized an additional $0.7 million of software development costs. During fiscal 2016, we determined that another in-service software product was impaired and incurred a $0.2 million impairment charge. If we determine that any software is impaired in the future, then we will be required to incur a charge against earnings in the amount of the impaired software. We will be submitting a Traditional 510(k) application through an accredited Third Party Reviewer to the FDA for clearance to introduce our new software platform to the market in fiscal 2017. If the FDA delays clearance on our new operating software platform for any reason, thereby delaying our ability to introduce this software in the market, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations, including affecting our future revenues and the carrying value of this software.\nOur success depends on our ability to sell our Medical Graphics and Medisoft cardiorespiratory products into our core hospital, clinic and physician office markets.\nOur current success depends on our ability to successfully upgrade existing accounts with new products and services, convert competitive accounts and provide billable and warranty services. Our longer term success depends on our ability to sustain new product developments, retain existing customers and increase our global market share.\nOur association with domestic Group Purchasing Organizations (\u201cGPOs\u201d) may result in reduced gross margins.\nGroup Purchasing Organizations (\"GPOs\") are entities through which groups of end-customers of a product act together through an agent to purchase a product from a distributer, supplier or manufacturer. GPOs operate routinely in the healthcare market. Price competition or negotiated lower prices with GPOs may exert downward pressure on prices we are able to charge for our products. We cannot ensure that we will be able to offset any downward price pressure through corresponding cost reductions. Any failure to offset this pressure could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nHealthcare policy changes, including national legislation to reform the U.S. healthcare system, may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThere have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payers to control healthcare costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act imposed a 2.3% excise tax on all U.S. medical device sales beginning in calendar 2013. This tax adversely affected our profitability. Although this tax has been suspended for two years beginning January 1, 2016, it may be imposed again in the future after the period of suspension ends. Additionally, if the market reduces purchase commitments during the period of uncertainty that may arise due to the recent change in government administration, we could experience a flattening or reduction in sales during this period. We are also unsure of the effect on the U.S. healthcare system of the new administration that took office on January 20, 2017.\nIf we are unable to sustain profitability in 2017 and beyond, our liquidity may be adversely affected.\nAlthough we were profitable in fiscal 2013 and 2015, we were unprofitable in fiscal 2008 through 2012 and in fiscal 2014 and 2016 and had an accumulated deficit of $8.1 million as of October 31, 2016. While we believe that our existing cash balance of $7.27 million as of October 31, 2016 is adequate to support operations for at least the next fiscal year, even after giving effect to the cash dividend we will pay in February 2017, we must sustain profitability. If this is not possible, we may need to obtain additional financing to be able to meet our future cash flow requirements, and we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or at all.\nThe financial stability of our vendors could affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on third party vendors for certain components used in our products. We purchase a number of significant components, such as capacitors, batteries and integrated circuits, from sole source suppliers. Although we attempt to maintain sufficient quantities of inventory of these components to minimize production delays or interruptions, we cannot ensure that we will find suitable alternatives at reasonable prices, if at all, or that any alternatives will remain available to us. Our inability to obtain acceptable components in a timely manner or find and maintain suitable replacement suppliers for components would have a material adverse effect on us, including our ability to manufacture our products. As a result of the disruptions in the financial markets and other macro-economic challenges currently affecting the economy of the United States and other parts of the world in recent years, our vendors may have experienced and continue to experience cash flow concerns. As a result, vendors may increase their prices, reduce their output or change terms of sales. Any demands by vendors for different payment terms may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow.\nTechnology in the medical device industry changes rapidly.\nRapid technological change, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions are all characteristics of the medical device industry. We face intense competition from other device manufacturers that may have access to greater resources. Our products may be rendered obsolete as a result of future innovations. Our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval and introducing products before we do. Any of these developments could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur future operations are dependent upon variables outside our control.\nSuccessful implementation of our business plan depends on the interaction of many variables, including the effects of changing industry conditions and new competition. While we believe that our business plan reflects reasonable judgments in assessing those risks, we cannot ensure that unforeseen influences will not adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan strategies. While we believe that our business plan projections are in line with achievable performance levels, we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain, and sustain, projected sales revenue.\nProtection of intellectual property is critical to our business.\nPatents and trademarks are critical in the medical device industry. We believe strongly in protecting our intellectual property and have a long history of obtaining patents, when available, in connection with our research and product development programs. We own a number of United States and foreign patents. We also own registered trademarks, and have applied for other trademarks in the United States and foreign countries. We cannot ensure that we will be granted patents and trademarks in the future, or that any patents and trademarks that we now hold or may be granted, or under which we have held license rights, will be valid or otherwise be of value to us. Even if our patents and trademarks are valid, others may be able to introduce non-infringing competitive products.\nAlthough patent and intellectual property disputes in the medical device area have often been settled through licensing agreements or similar arrangements, costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial, and we cannot ensure that necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms or at all. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary intellectual property, including know-how, in part, through confidentiality agreements, non-compete agreements and assignment of invention provisions in agreements with employees, consultants and other parties, as well as through contractual exclusivity with certain suppliers. We cannot ensure that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors.\nRealization of our deferred tax assets depends on our continued profitability.\nOur current profitability in the U.S. and our expectation of future profitability in U.S. and Belgian operations is the basis for our valuation allowance on domestic and foreign deferred tax assets. The valuation of the respective deferred tax assets of Medical Graphics and Medisoft depends on the respective future profitability of each company. Our inability to achieve necessary levels of profitability could require us to record valuation reserves against our recorded deferred tax assets.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will pay future dividends.\nWe recently declared a special dividend. The fact that we declared a special dividend does not suggest and shareholders should not expect that our Board of Directors will declare a regular or special cash dividend in the future. Any future dividends will depend on a variety of factors including, our liquidity and balance sheet position, solvency, strength of operations, product successes, research and development needs and other factors.\nWe depend upon our senior management and other key personnel.\nOur success depends largely on effective leadership from our senior management and other key personnel. Competition for qualified personnel with sufficient and relevant experience in the medical device industry is intense. Accordingly, the loss of the services of these individuals, or the inability to hire additional key individuals as required, could have a material adverse effect on us, including our current and future product development efforts.\nAnti-Takeover provisions in Minnesota law may make a hostile takeover of our business more difficult.\nWe are governed by the provisions of Sections 302A.671 and 302A.673 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act. These anti-takeover provisions could potentially operate to deny shareholders the receipt of a premium on their common stock and may also have a depressive effect on the market price of our common stock. Section 302A.671 generally provides that the shares of a corporation acquired in a \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d have no voting rights unless voting rights are approved by the shareholders in a prescribed manner. A \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d is generally defined as an acquisition of beneficial ownership of shares that would, when added to all other shares beneficially owned by the acquiring person, entitle the acquiring person to have voting power of 20% or more in the election of directors. Section 302A.673 prohibits a public corporation from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d for a period of four years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A \u201cbusiness combination\u201d includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions. An \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d is a person who is the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock. Reference is made to the detailed terms of Sections 302A.671 and 302A.673 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act. We have also entered into agreements with certain executive officers that provide for certain benefits upon a change of control. These agreements would make any sale of the Company more expensive to a third party.", "PERMNO": 89609, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "MGCD"}
