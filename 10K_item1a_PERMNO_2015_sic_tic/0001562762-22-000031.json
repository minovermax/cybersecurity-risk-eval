Risk Factors\nYou should carefully\nconsider the following risk factors\nin addition to the other information\nincluded in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nThese risk factors are not\nthe only risks we face.\nOur business could also be affected\nby\nadditional risks and uncertainties not currently\nknown to us or that we currently consider\nto be immaterial.\nIf any\nof these risks or other risks that are yet unknown\nwere to occur,\nour business, operating results and\nfinancial\ncondition, as well as the value of an investment\nin our common stock could be adversely\naffected.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur operating results, our ability to execute\non our strategy and the carrying value of our assets\nare exposed to\nthe effects of changing commodity prices.\nThe oil and gas business is a commodity business.\nOur revenues, operating results\nand future rate of growth are\nhighly dependent on the prices we receive for\ncrude oil, bitumen, natural gas\nand NGLs.\nSuch prices can fluctuate\nwidely depending upon global events or conditions\nthat affect supply and demand, most\nof which are out of our\ncontrol.\nIn early 2020 global oil demand decreased precipitously\nalongside global COVID-19 economic shutdowns.\nAlthough global oil demand and global oil prices improved\nthrough 2021, the global economic recovery\nremains\nuncertain.\nOur industry will continue to be exposed to\nthe effects of changing commodity prices\ngiven the\nvolatility in commodity price drivers\nand the worldwide political and economic environment\ngenerally,\nas well as\ncontinued uncertainty caused by\narmed hostilities in various oil-producing regions\naround the globe.\nLower crude oil, bitumen, natural gas\nand NGL prices may have a material adverse\neffect on our revenues,\noperating income, cash flows\nand liquidity, and\nmay also affect the amount of dividends we elect\nto declare and\npay on our common stock and the amount\nof shares we elect to acquire as part of the share repurchase\nprogram\nand the timing of such acquisitions.\nLower prices may also limit the amount of reserves we\ncan produce\neconomically,\nthus adversely affecting our proved\nreserves and reserve replacement ratio\nand accelerating the\nreduction in our existing reserve levels\nas we continue production from upstream\nfields. Prolonged depressed\ncrude oil prices may affect certain\ndecisions related to our operations,\nincluding decisions to reduce capital\ninvestments or curtail operated\nproduction.\nSignificant reductions in crude oil, bitumen, natural\ngas and NGL prices could also require us to\nreduce our capital\nexpenditures, impair the carrying value of our\nassets or discontinue the classification of certain\nassets as proved\nreserves.\nIn the past three years, we recognized\nseveral impairments, which\nare described in\nNote 7\n.\nIf commodity\nprices decrease relative to their current\nlevels, and as we continue to optimize\nour investments and exercise\ncapital flexibility,\nit is reasonably likely we could\nincur future impairments to long-lived assets\nused in operations,\ninvestment in nonconsolidated\nentities accounted for under the equity\nmethod and unproved properties.\nAlthough it is not reasonably practicable to\nquantify the impact of any future impairments\nor estimated change to\nour unit-of-production\nrates at this time, our results\nof operations could be adversely affected\nas a result.\nOur business has been, and will continue to be, adversely affected\nby the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures put in place to\naddress it have negatively\nimpacted the global economy,\ndisrupted global supply chains, reduced global demand for\noil and gas and created significant\nvolatility and\ndisruption of financial and commodity markets.\nOver the course of the pandemic, public health\nofficials have\nrecommended or mandated certain\nprecautions to mitigate\nthe spread of COVID-19, including limiting non-\nessential gatherings of people, ceasing all non-essential\ntravel and issuing \u201csocial or\nphysical distancing\u201d guidelines,\n\u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders and\nmandatory closures or reductions in capacity\nfor non-essential businesses.\nAlthough\nsome of these limitations and mandates have\nbeen relaxed in certain jurisdictions,\nothers have been reinstated\nin\nareas that have experienced a resurgence\nof COVID-19 cases and there is no guarantee\nrestrictions will not be\nreimposed in the future.\nDespite the increased availability\nof vaccines in certain jurisdictions, the COVID\npandemic may continue or worsen\nduring the upcoming months, including as a result of the emergence\nof more\ninfectious variants of the virus,\nvaccine hesitancy or increased business and\nsocial activities, which may cause\ngovernmental authorities to reinstate\nrestrictions.\nAs a result, the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\nRisk Factors\nConocoPhillips\n2021 10-K\nremains uncertain and will depend on the severity,\nlocation and duration of the effects\nand spread of the disease,\nthe effectiveness and duration\nof actions taken by authorities to contain\nthe virus or treat its effect, the availability\nand effectiveness of vaccines\nor other treatments, and how quickly and\nto what extent economic conditions\nimprove.\nSee our Human Capital Management section within Item 1 and 2-Business and Properties\n, for additional\ninformation on how we have\nbeen impacted and the steps we have\ntaken in response.\nOur business is likely to continue to\nbe further negatively impacted by the COVID\n-19 pandemic.\nThese impacts\ncould include but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nReduced demand for our products\nas a result of reductions in travel\nand commerce, whether related to\nmandated restrictions or otherwise;\n\u25cf\nDisruptions in our supply chain due in part to scrutiny\nor embargoing of shipments from infected\nareas or\ninvocation of force majeure\nclauses in commercial contracts\ndue to restrictions imposed as a result\nof the\nglobal response to the pandemic;\n\u25cf\nFailure of third-parties on which we rely,\nincluding our suppliers, contract\nmanufacturers, contractors,\njoint venture partners\nand external business partners, to\nmeet their obligations to the company,\nor\nsignificant disruptions in their ability to do so,\nwhich may be caused by their own financial or operational\ndifficulties or restrictions imposed in response\nto the disease outbreak;\n\u25cf\nReduced workforce productivity\ncaused by, but\nnot limited to, illness, travel\nrestrictions, quarantine, or\ngovernment mandates;\n\u25cf\nIncreased challenges in retention\nof personnel caused by vaccine hesitancy\nand the resistance of some in\nour workforce to comply with\nworkplace protocols necessary to ensure\nthe health and safety of our\nworkforce and minimize disruptions\nto the business, such as vaccine and testing requirements,\nor the use\nof personal protective equipment; and\n\u25cf\nVoluntary or involuntary\ncurtailments to support oil prices or alleviate storage\nshortages for our products.\nAny of these factors, or other cascading\neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic that\nare not currently foreseeable,\ncould materially increase our costs,\nnegatively impact our revenues and\ndamage our financial condition, results of\noperations, cash flows and liquidity position.\nDespite the rollout of vaccines, the pandemic continues\nto progress\nand evolve, and the full extent and\nduration of any such impacts cannot\nbe predicted at this time because of the\nsweeping impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on daily life\naround the world and a lack of certainty\nas to if or when\nconditions will return to pre-COVID\nlevels.\nUnless we successfully develop resources, the scope\nof our business will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to\nour business.\nAs we produce crude oil and natural\ngas from our existing portfolio,\nthe amount of our remaining reserves\ndeclines.\nIf we are not successful in replacing the crude oil and\nnatural gas we produce with\ngood prospects for\nfuture organic opportunities or through\nacquisitions, our business will decline.\nIn addition, our ability to\nsuccessfully develop our reserves is dependent\non a number of factors, including our ability to\nobtain and renew\nrights to develop and produce hydrocarbons;\nour success at reservoir optimization; our ability\nto bring long-lead\ntime, capital intensive projects\nto completion on budget and on schedule; and our ability\nto efficiently and\nprofitably operate mature\nproperties.\nIf we are not successful in developing the resources\nin our portfolio, our\nfinancial condition and results of operations\nmay be adversely affected.\nThe exploration and production of oil and gas is a highly comp\netitive industry.\nThe exploration and production\nof crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs\nis a highly competitive business.\nWe\ncompete with private, public\nand state-owned companies in all\nfacets of the exploration and\nproduction business,\nincluding to locate and obtain new sources\nof supply and to produce crude oil, bitumen, natural\ngas and NGLs in an\nefficient, cost-effective\nmanner.\nWe must compete for\nthe materials, equipment, services, employees\nand other\npersonnel (including geologists, geophysicists,\nengineers and other specialists) necessary to conduct\nour business.\nSome of our competitors are larger\nand have greater resources\nthan we do, or may have\nestablished strategic\nlong-\nRisk Factors\nConocoPhillips\n2021 10-K\nterm positions or strong governmental\nor other relationships in countries\nor areas in which we operate, or may\nbe\nwilling to incur a higher level of risk than we are willing to\nincur to obtain potential sources\nof supply.\nAs a\nconsequence, we may be at a competitive\ndisadvantage in certain respects,\nsuch as in accessing the necessary\nmaterials, equipment, services, resources\nand personnel.\nIn addition, we may be at a competitive disadvantage\nwhen competing with state-owned\ncompanies if they are motivated\nby political or other factors in making their\nbusiness decisions, with less emphasis on financial returns.\nIf we are not successful in our competition for\nnew\nreserves, our financial condition and results\nof operations may be adversely\naffected.\nAny material change in the factors and assumptions\nunderlying our estimates of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas\nand NGL reserves could impair the quantity and value of those reserves.\nOur proved reserve information\nincluded in this annual report represents\nmanagement\u2019s best estimates\nbased on\nassumptions, as of a specified date, of the volumes\nto be recovered from underground\naccumulations of crude oil,\nbitumen, natural gas and NGLs.\nSuch volumes cannot be directly measured and the\nestimates and underlying\nassumptions used by management are subject to\nsubstantial risk and uncertainty.\nAny material changes in the\nfactors and assumptions underlying\nour estimates of these items could result\nin a material negative impact to the\nvolume of reserves reported or could\ncause us to incur impairment expenses on property\nassociated with the\nproduction of those reserves.\nFuture reserve revisions could also\nresult from changes in, among other things,\ngovernmental regulation.\nOur business may be adversely affected by price controls,\ngovernment-imposed limitations on production\nor\nexports of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs, or the unavailability of adequate\ngathering, processing,\ncompression, transportation, and pipeline facilities and\nequipment for our production of crude oil, bitumen,\nnatural gas and NGLs.\nAs discussed herein, our operations\nare subject to extensive governmental\nregulations.\nFrom time to time,\nregulatory agencies have imposed\nprice controls and limitations\non production by restricting the rate\nof flow of\ncrude oil, bitumen, natural gas and\nNGL wells below actual production capacity.\nSimilarly, in response\nto increased\ndomestic energy costs, circumstances\ndetermined to be in the economic interest\nof the country,\nor a declared\nnational emergency,\nthe U.S. government could restrict\nthe export of our products which would\nadversely impact\nour domestic business.\nBecause legal requirements are frequently\nchanged and subject to interpretation,\nwe\ncannot predict whether future restrictions\non our business may be enacted or become applicable\nto us.\nOur ability to sell and deliver the crude oil, bitumen, natural\ngas, NGLs and LNG that we produce also\ndepends on\nthe availability,\nproximity,\nand capacity of gathering, processing, compression,\ntransportation and pipeline facilities\nand equipment, as well as any necessary diluents\nto prepare our crude oil, bitumen, natural\ngas, NGLs and LNG for\ntransport.\nFurthermore, we rely on there being sufficient\nfacilities and takeaway\ncapacity to support our ambitions\nto reduce routine flaring.\nThe facilities, equipment and diluents\nwe rely on may be temporarily\nunavailable to us\ndue to market conditions, extreme\nweather events, regulatory\nreasons, mechanical reasons or other factors\nor\nconditions, many of which are beyond\nour control.\nIn addition, in certain newer plays, the capacity\nof necessary\nfacilities, equipment and diluents may\nnot be sufficient to accommodate production\nfrom existing and new wells,\nand construction and permitting delays,\npermitting costs and regulatory or\nother constraints could limit or delay\nthe construction, manufacture or other acquisition\nof new facilities and equipment.\nIf any facilities, equipment or\ndiluents, or any of the transportation\nmethods and channels that we rely on become unavailable\nfor any period of\ntime, we may incur increased costs\nto transport our crude oil, bitumen, natural\ngas, NGLs and LNG for sale or we\nmay be forced to curtail our\nproduction of crude oil, bitumen, natural\ngas or NGLs.\nRisk Factors\nConocoPhillips\n2021 10-K\nOur investments in joint ventures decrease\nour ability to manage risk.\nWe conduct many of our operations\nthrough joint ventures in which we\nmay share control with our\njoint venture\npartners.\nThere is a risk our joint venture participants\nmay at any time have economic,\nbusiness or legal interests\nor goals that are inconsistent\nwith those of the joint venture or us, or our joint\nventure partners may be unable\nto\nmeet their economic or other obligations and\nwe may be required to fulfill those obligations\nalone.\nFailure by us,\nor an entity in which we have a joint venture\ninterest, to adequately manage\nthe risks associated with any\noperations, acquisitions or dispositions could\nhave a material adverse\neffect on the financial condition or results\nof\noperations of our joint ventures\nand, in turn, our business and operations.\nOur operations present hazards and risks that require significant\nand continuous oversight.\nThe scope and nature of our operations\npresent a variety of significant hazards\nand risks, including operational\nhazards and risks such as explosions,\nfires, product spills, severe weather,\ngeological events, labor disputes,\ngeopolitical tensions, armed hostilities, terrorist\nor piracy attacks, sabotage,\ncivil unrest or cyberattacks.\nOur\noperations are subject to the additional\nhazards of pollution, toxic substances\nand other environmental hazards\nand risks.\nOffshore activities may pose incrementally\ngreater risks because of complex\nsubsurface conditions such\nas higher reservoir pressures, water\ndepths and metocean conditions.\nAll such hazards could result in loss of\nhuman life, significant property\nand equipment damage, environmental\npollution, impairment of operations,\nsubstantial losses to us and damage to\nour reputation.\nOur business and operations may be disrupted\nif we do not\nrespond, or are perceived not to\nrespond, in an appropriate manner to\nany of these hazards and risks\nor any other\nmajor crisis or if we are unable to efficiently\nrestore or replace affected\noperational components\nand capacity.\nFurther, our\ninsurance may not be adequate to\ncompensate us for all resulting\nlosses, and the cost to obtain\nadequate coverage may\nincrease for us in the future.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe expect to continue\nto incur substantial capital\nexpenditures and operating costs\nas a result of our compliance\nwith existing and future environmental\nlaws and regulations.\nOur business is subject to numerous laws and\nregulations relating to the protection\nof the environment, which are\nexpected to continue to have\nan increasing impact on our operations.\nFor a description of the most significant of\nthese environmental laws and\nregulations, see the \u201cContingencies-Environmental\u201d\nand \u201cContingencies-Climate\nChange\u201d sections of Management\u2019s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations.\nThese laws and regulations continue\nto increase in both number and complexity and\naffect our operations\nwith\nrespect to, among other things:\n\u25cf\nPermits required in connection with exploration,\ndrilling, production and other activities, including those\nissued by national, subnational, and local authorities;\n\u25cf\nThe discharge of pollutants into\nthe environment;\n\u25cf\nEmissions into the atmosphere, such\nas nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury\nand GHG emissions,\nincluding methane;\n\u25cf\nCarbon taxes;\n\u25cf\nThe handling, use, storage, transportation,\ndisposal and cleanup of hazardous materials\nand hazardous\nand nonhazardous wastes\n;\n\u25cf\nThe dismantlement, abandonment and restoration\nof historic properties and facilities at\nthe end of their\nuseful lives;\nand\n\u25cf\nExploration and production\nactivities in certain areas, such as offshore\nenvironments, arctic fields, oil\nsands reservoirs and unconventional\nplays.\nWe have incurred and\nwill continue to incur substantial\ncapital, operating and maintenance, and\nremediation\nexpenditures as a result of these laws and\nregulations.\nIn addition, to the extent these expenditures\nare assumed\nby a buyer as a result of a disposition, it may\nresult in our incurring substantial costs\nif the buyer is unable to satisfy\nthese obligations.\nAny failure by us to comply\nwith existing or future laws, regulations\nand other requirements\ncould result in administrative\nor civil penalties, criminal fines, other enforcement\nactions or third-party litigation\nRisk Factors\nConocoPhillips\n2021 10-K\nagainst us.\nTo the extent\nthese expenditures, as with all costs,\nare not ultimately reflected in\nthe prices of our\nproducts and services, our business, financial condition, results\nof operations and cash flows in future\nperiods\ncould be materially adversely affected.\nExisting and future laws, regulations and internal initiatives\nrelating to global climate change, such as\nlimitations on GHG emissions may impact or limit our business plans,\nresult in significant expenditures, promote\nalternative uses of energy or reduce demand for our products.\nContinuing political and social attention\nto the issue of global climate change has resulted\nin both existing and\npending international agreements\nand national, regional or local legislation and regulatory\nmeasures to limit GHG\nemissions, such as cap and trade regimes, specific\nemission standards, carbon taxes,\nrestrictive permitting,\nincreased fuel efficiency standards\nand incentives or mandates for renewable\nenergy.\nAlthough we may support\nmany of these legislative and regulatory\nmeasures, how and when they are enacted could\nresult in a material\nadverse effect to our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations\nand cash flows in future periods.\nFor example, in November 2021,\nthe U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency published a Proposed Rule that would\nrevise the regulations governing\nthe emission of GHG and volatile organic compounds\nfrom new oil and gas\nproduction facilities, and emission guidelines\nfor states to use when revising\nClean Air Act implementation plans to\nlimit GHG emissions from existing oil and gas\nfacilities.\nAlthough the company supports the direct federal\nregulation of methane from new and existing\nsources,\nthe final form and substance of any regulations\nare not\ncurrently known and could result in additional\ncapital expenditures and compliance,\noperating and maintenance\ncosts, any of which may have\nan adverse effect on our business\nand results of operations.\nAdditionally,\nin 2021, the U.S. joined the international community at\nthe 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26).\nAt the conclusion of COP26, the U.S. and nearly\n200 other counties agreed to the Glasgow Climate\nPact,\ncommitting to revisiting and strengthening\ntheir current emissions targets\nto 2030 in 2022 and finalizing the\noutstanding elements of the Paris\nAgreement.\nIn addition, our operations continue\nin countries around the world\nwhich are party to the Paris Agreement.\nThe implementation of current\nagreements and regulatory measures,\nas\nwell as any future agreements\nor measures addressing climate change and\nGHG emissions, may adversely impact\nthe demand for our products, impose taxes\non our products or operations or require\nus to purchase emission\ncredits or reduce emission of GHGs from our operations.\nAs a result, we may experience declines in commodity\nprices or incur substantial capital expenditures\nand compliance, operating, maintenance\nand remediation costs,\nany of which may have an\nadverse effect on our business\nand results of operations.\nIn September 2021, we announced an improvement\nto our Paris-aligned climate risk framework,\nwhereby we\ncommitted to an improvement\nto our targets for reduc\ning our scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity on both a\ngross\noperated and net equity basis and reaffirmed\nour commitment to advocate\nfor the reduction of scope 3 emissions\nthrough our support for a U.S. carbon\nprice.\nCompliance with, and achievement of,\nclimate change-related\ninternal initiatives such as the foregoing\nmay increase costs, require\nus to purchase emission credits, or limit or\nimpact our business plans.\nIf we are not successful in select internal initiatives,\nwe may be adversely affected\nand\npotentially need to reduce\neconomic end-of-field life\nof certain assets and impair associated\nnet book value.\nIncreasing attention to\nglobal climate change has also resulted in pressure\nfrom and upon stockholders,\nfinancial\ninstitutions and/or financial markets\nto modify their relationships with oil and gas\ncompanies and to limit\ninvestments and/or funding to\nsuch companies.\nFor example, Harvard University\nannounced in September 2021\nthat it will stop investing\nits $42 billion endowment in fossil fuels and will let its current\ninvestments expire without\nrenewal.\nAs public pressure continues to\nmount, our access to capital on terms we\nfind favorable (if it is available\nat all) may be limited and our costs\nmay increase,\nour reputation could be damaged or our business\nand results of\noperations may be otherwise adversely\naffected.\nFurthermore, increasing attention\nto global climate change has resulted\nin an increased likelihood of governmental\ninvestigations and private\nlitigation, which could increase our costs\nor otherwise adversely affect our business.\nBeginning in 2017, cities, counties, governments\nand other entities in several states\nin the U.S. have filed lawsuits\nagainst oil and gas companies,\nincluding ConocoPhillips, seeking compensatory\ndamages and equitable relief to\nRisk Factors\nConocoPhillips\n2021 10-K\nabate alleged climate change impacts.\nAdditional lawsuits with similar allegations are\nexpected to be filed.\nThe\namounts claimed by plaintiffs are unspecified\nand the legal and factual issues\ninvolved in these cases are\nunprecedented.\nConocoPhillips believes these lawsuits\nare factually and legally meritless and\nare an inappropriate\nvehicle to address the challenges associated\nwith climate change and will vigorously\ndefend against such lawsuits.\nThe ultimate outcome and impact to\nus cannot be predicted with certainty,\nand we could incur substantial\nlegal\ncosts associated with defending\nthese and similar lawsuits in the future.\nWe could also receive lawsuits\nalleging a\nfailure or lack of diligence to meet our\npublicly stated ESG goals, so\ncalled \u201cgreenwashing\u201d cases.\nIn addition, although we design and operate\nour business operations to accommodate\nexpected climatic\nconditions, to the extent there are\nsignificant changes in the earth\u2019s\nclimate, such as more severe or frequent\nweather conditions in the markets\nwhere we operate or the areas\nwhere our assets reside, we could incur\nincreased expenses, our operations\nand supply chain could be adversely impacted, and\ndemand for our products\ncould fall.\nFor more information on legislation\nor precursors for possible regulation\nrelating to global climate change that\naffect or could affect\nour operations and a description\nof the company\u2019s response,\nsee the \u201cContingencies-Climate\nChange\u201d section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n.\nDomestic and worldwide political and economic developments\ncould damage our operations and materially\nreduce our profitability and cash flows.\nActions of the U.S., state, local\nand foreign governments, through\nsanctions, tax and other legislation, executive\norder and commercial restrictions,\ncould reduce our operating profitability\nboth in the U.S. and abroad.\nIn certain\nlocations, restrictions on our operations;\nleasing restrictions; special taxes\nor tax assessments; and payment\ntransparency regulations\nthat could require us to disclose competitively\nsensitive information or might\ncause us to\nviolate non-disclosure laws of other countries\nhave been imposed or proposed by governments\nor certain interest\ngroups.\nFor example, in 2020 a ballot initiative\nknown as the Fair Share Act was proposed\nin the state of Alaska,\nwhich, if enacted would have increased\nthe state\u2019s\nshare of production revenues and\nrequired producers to\npublicly disclose additional financial information.\nAlthough ultimately defeated,\nsimilar initiatives may be\nproposed and may be successful in the future.\nIn addition, we may face regulatory\nchanges in the U.S. including,\nbut not limited to, the enactment of tax\nlaw changes that adversely affect\nthe fossil fuel industry,\nnew methane\nemissions standards, restrictive\nflaring requirements, and more stringent\nenvironmental impact studies\nand\nreviews.\nWe also cannot rule out the possibility\nof similar regulatory shifts and attendant\ncost and market access\nimplications in other international jurisdictions.\nOne area subject to significant political and\nregulatory activity is the use of hydraulic\nfracturing, an essential\ncompletion technique that facilitates\nproduction of oil and natural gas\notherwise trapped in lower permeability\nrock formations.\nA range of local, state,\nfederal and national laws and\nregulations currently govern or,\nin some\nhydraulic fracturing\noperations, prohibit hydraulic\nfracturing in some jurisdictions.\nAlthough hydraulic fracturing\nhas been conducted safely for\nmany decades, a number of new laws, regulations\nand permitting requirements are\nunder consideration which could result\nin increased costs, operating restrictions,\noperational delays or could\nlimit\nthe ability to develop oil and natural\ngas resources.\nCertain jurisdictions in which we operate have\nadopted or are\nconsidering regulations that could impose\nnew or more stringent permitting, disclosure\nor other regulatory\nrequirements on hydraulic\nfracturing or other oil and natural gas\noperations, including subsurface water\ndisposal.\nIn addition, certain interest\ngroups have also proposed ballot initiatives\nand constitutional amendments designed\nto restrict oil and natural\ngas development generally and hydraulic\nfracturing in particular.\nIn the event that ballot\ninitiatives, local, state,\nor national restrictions or prohibitions are\nadopted and result in more stringent\nlimitations\non the production and development of oil and\nnatural gas in areas where we\nconduct operations, we may\nincur\nsignificant costs to comply with\nsuch requirements or may experience delays\nor curtailment in the permitting or\npursuit of exploration,\ndevelopment or production activities.\nSuch compliance costs and delays,\ncurtailments,\nlimitations or prohibitions could have\na material adverse effect\non our business, prospects, results of operations,\nfinancial condition and liquidity.\nRisk Factors\nConocoPhillips\n2021 10-K\nThe U.S. government can also prevent\nor restrict us from doing business in foreign\ncountries.\nThese restrictions\nand those of foreign governments\nhave in the past limited our ability to\noperate in, or gain access to,\nopportunities\nin various countries.\nActions by host governments, such\nas the expropriation of our oil assets by the Venezuelan\ngovernment, have affected\noperations significantly in the past\nand may continue to do so in the future.\nChanges in\ndomestic and international policies and regulations\nmay affect our ability to collect payments\nsuch as those\npertaining\nto the settlement with Petr\u00f3leos\nde Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA\n)\nor the ICSID Award against\nthe\nGovernment of Venezuela;\nor to obtain or maintain licenses or permits,\nincluding those necessary for drilling and\ndevelopment of wells in various locations.\nSimilarly, the declaration\nof a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d could\nresult in\nactions to limit exports of our products and other\nrestrictions.\nLocal political and economic factors\nin international markets\ncould have a material adverse\neffect on us.\nApproximately 38 percent\nof our hydrocarbon\nproduction was derived from production\noutside the U.S. in 2021,\nand 29 percent of our proved reserves,\nas of December 31, 2021, were located\noutside the U.S.\nWe are subject to\nrisks associated with operations\nin both domestic and international markets,\nincluding changes in foreign\ngovernmental policies relating\nto crude oil, natural gas, bitumen, NGLs\nor LNG pricing and taxation, other\npolitical,\neconomic or diplomatic developments (including\nthe macro effects of international\ntrade policies and disputes),\npotentially disruptive geopolitical conditions,\nand international monetary and currency\nrate fluctuations.\nRestrictions on production of oil and\ngas could increase to the extent\ngovernments view such measures as\na viable\napproach for pursuing national\nand global energy and climate policies.\nIn addition, some countries where we\noperate lack a fully independent judiciary\nsystem.\nThis, coupled with changes in foreign law or policy,\nresults in a\nlack of legal certainty that exposes\nour operations to increased risks,\nincluding increased difficulty in enforcing\nour\nagreements in those jurisdictions and increased risks\nof adverse actions by local government authorities,\nsuch as\nexpropriations.\nOther Risk Factors Facing\nour Business or Operations\nWe may need additional capital in the\nfuture, and it may not be available on acceptable terms\nor at all.\nWe have historically\nrelied primarily upon cash generated\nby our operations to fund our\noperations and strategy;\nhowever,\nwe have also relied from time to\ntime on access to the debt and equity capital markets\nfor funding.\nThere can be no assurance that additional\ndebt or equity financing will be available in the future on\nacceptable\nterms or at all.\nIn addition, although we anticipate we will be\nable to repay our existing\nindebtedness when it\nmatures or in accordance with our stated\nplans, there can be no assurance we will be able to\ndo so.\nOur ability to\nobtain additional financing or refinance our existing\nindebtedness when it matures or in\naccordance with our\nplans, will be subject to a number of factors,\nincluding market conditions, our\noperating performance, investor\nsentiment and our ability to incur additional debt\nin compliance with agreements governing our then-outstanding\ndebt.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient\nfunds from operations or raise\nadditional capital for any reason,\nour\nbusiness could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we are regularly evaluated\nby the major rating agencies based on a number of factors,\nincluding our\nfinancial strength and conditions affecting\nthe oil and gas industry generally.\nWe and other industry companies\nhave had their ratings reduced\nin the past due to negative commodity\nprice outlooks.\nAny downgrade in our credit\nrating or announcement that our credit\nrating is under review for possible\ndowngrade could increase the cost\nassociated with any additional indebtedness\nwe incur.\nRisk Factors\nConocoPhillips\n2021 10-K\nOur business may be adversely affected by deterioration\nin the credit quality of, or defaults under\nour contracts\nwith, third-parties with whom we do business.\nThe operation of our business requires\nus to engage in transactions with\nnumerous counterparties operating\nin a\nvariety of industries, including other companies\noperating in the oil and gas industry.\nThese counterparties may\ndefault on their obligations to\nus as a result of operational failures\nor a lack of liquidity,\nor for other reasons,\nincluding bankruptcy.\nMarket speculation about the credit\nquality of these counterparties, or their ability\nto\ncontinue performing on their existing\nobligations, may also exacerbate\nany operational difficulties\nor liquidity\nissues they are experiencing, particularly as it relates\nto other companies in the oil and gas industry\nas a result of\nthe volatility in commodity prices.\nAny default by any of our\ncounterparties may result in our\ninability to perform\nour obligations under agreements we have\nmade with third-parties or may otherwise adversely\naffect our business\nor results of operations.\nIn addition, our rights against any of our counterparties\nas a result of a default may not be\nadequate to compensate us\nfor the resulting harm caused or may\nnot be enforceable at all in some circumstances.\nWe may also be forced\nto incur additional costs as we attempt\nto enforce any rights\nwe have against\na defaulting\ncounterparty,\nwhich could further adversely impact our results\nof operations.\nOur ability to execute our capital\nreturn program is subject to certain considerations.\nIn December 2021, we initiated a three\n-tier capital return program\nthat consists of our ordinary dividend, share\nrepurchases and a quarterly variable\nreturn of cash (VROC).\nOrdinary dividends are authorized and determined\nby our Board of Directors in its\nsole discretion and depend\nupon a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nCash available for distribution;\n\u25cf\nOur results of operations and anticipated\nfuture results of operations;\n\u25cf\nOur financial condition, especially in relation to\nthe anticipated future capital needs of our\nproperties;\n\u25cf\nThe level of distributions paid by comparable\ncompanies;\n\u25cf\nOur operating expenses; and\n\u25cf\nOther factors our Board of Directors\ndeems relevant.\nVROC distributions are also authorized\nand determined by our Board of Directors\nin its sole discretion and depend\nupon a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nThe anticipated level of distributions\nrequired to meet our capital returns\ncommitment;\n\u25cf\nForward prices;\n\u25cf\nBalance sheet cash;\n\u25cf\nTotal\nyield; and\n\u25cf\nOther factors our Board of Directors\ndeems relevant.\nWe expect to continue\nto pay a quarterly ordinary dividend\nto our stockholders.\nIn addition, based on the current\nenvironment, we anticipate\nalso paying a quarterly VROC to\nour shareholders staggered from\nthe ordinary\ndividend payment, resulting in up to\neight cash distributions to shareholders\nthroughout the year;\nhowever,\nthe\namount of the VROC is variable and will depend upon the\nabove factors, and our Board\nof Directors may determine\nnot to pay a VROC in a quarter or may\ncease declaring a VROC at any time.\nIn addition,\nour Board of Directors may\nreduce our ordinary dividend or cease declaring dividends\nat any time, including if it determines that\nour net cash\nprovided by operating activities,\nafter deducting capital expenditures\nand investments, are not sufficient\nto pay\nour desired levels of dividends to our stockholders\nor to pay dividends to our stockholders\nat all.\nRisk Factors\nConocoPhillips\n2021 10-K\nAdditionally, as\nof December 31, 2021, $10.9 billion of repurchase authority\nremained of the $25 billion share\nrepurchase program our Board\nof Directors had authorized.\nOur share repurchase program\ndoes not obligate us to\nacquire a specific number of shares during any\nperiod, and our decision to commence, discontinue\nor resume\nrepurchases in any period will depend\non the same factors that our Board\nof Directors may consider when\ndeclaring dividends, among others.\nIn the past we have suspended our share\nrepurchase program in response\nto\nmarket downturns, including as a\nresult of the oil market downturn\nthat began in early 2020, and we may do so\nagain in the future.\nAny downward revision\nin the amount of our ordinary dividend or VROC or the volume of\nshares we purchase\nunder our share repurchase program\ncould have an adverse effect\non the market price of our common stock.\nThere are substantial risks with any\nacquisitions or divestitures we have completed\nor that we may choose to\nundertake.\nWe regularly review our portfolio\nand pursue growth through acquisitions\nand seek to divest noncore assets or\nbusinesses.\nWe may not be able to complete these\ntransactions on favorable\nterms, on a timely basis, or at all.\nEven if we do complete such transactions,\nour cash flow from operations may\nbe adversely impacted or otherwise\nthe transactions may not result in the\nbenefits anticipated due to various\nrisks, including, but not limited to (i) the\nfailure of the acquired assets or businesses\nto meet or exceed expected\nreturns, including risk of impairment; (ii)\nthe inability to dispose of noncore assets and\nbusinesses on satisfactory terms and conditions;\nand (iii) the\ndiscovery of unknown and unforeseen liabilities\nor other issues related to any\nacquisition for which contractual\nprotections are inadequate\nor we lack insurance or indemnities, including environmental\nliabilities, or with regard\nto divested assets or businesses, claims by\npurchasers to whom we have provided\ncontractual indemnification.\nIn addition, we may face difficulties\nin integrating the operations,\ntechnologies, products and personnel of any\nacquired assets or businesses. For example,\nwe completed two major acquisitions in\n2021, including the\nacquisition of Concho in January and the acquisition of the Shell Permian assets\nin December.\nCombined, these\ntransactions added approximately\n800,000 net acres, thereby significantly\nincreasing our unconventional\nposition\nand operations in the Permian.\nWe may still encounter\ndifficulties integrating the acquired\nassets into our\nbusiness.\nThere are a large number of processes,\npolicies, procedures, operations\nand technologies and systems\nthat must be integrated\nin connection with the transactions and the integration\nof the acquired assets.\nIt is\npossible that the integration process\ncould result in the disruption of our ongoing business;\ninconsistencies in\nstandards, controls,\nprocedures and policies; unexpected integration\nissues; higher than expected integration\ncosts\nand an overall post-completion\nintegration process that\ntakes longer than originally anticipated.\nWe have been\nand will be required to devote management\nattention and resources\nto integrating the business\npractices and\noperations.\nAny delays encountered\nin the integration process\ncould have an adverse effect\non our revenues or on\nour level of expenses or capital investment\nand operating results, which may\nadversely affect the value\nof our\ncommon stock.\nIn addition, the actual integration may\nresult in additional and unforeseen\nexpenses.\nAlthough we\nexpect that the strategic benefits,\nand additional income, as well as the realization\nof other efficiencies related to\nthe integration of the acquired\nassets, may offset incremental\ntransaction-related costs\nover time, if we are not\nable to adequately address integration\nchallenges.\nRisk Factors\nConocoPhillips\n2021 10-K\nOur technologies, systems and networks\nmay be subject to cyberattacks.\nOur business, like others within the oil and\ngas industry,\nhas become increasingly dependent on digital\ntechnologies, some of which are managed by third\n-party service providers on whom we rely\nto help us collect, host\nor process information.\nAmong other activities, we rely on digital technology to\nestimate oil and gas reserves,\nprocess and record financial and operating\ndata, analyze seismic and drilling information\nand communicate with\nemployees and third-parties.\nAs a result, we face various cybersecurity\nthreats such as attempts to\ngain\nunauthorized access to, or control\nof, sensitive information\nabout our operations and our employees, attempts\nto\nrender our data or systems\n(or those of third-parties with whom we do business,\nincluding third-party cloud and IT\nservice providers) corrupted or unusable,\nthreats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure\nas well as those\nof third-parties with whom we do business,\nincluding third-party cloud and IT service providers,\nand attempted\ncyber terrorism.\nIn addition, computers control\noil and gas production, processing equipment\nand distribution systems\nglobally and\nare necessary to deliver our production\nto market.\nA disruption, failure, or a cyberattack\nof these operating\nsystems, or of the networks\n,\nsoftware and infrastructure\non which they rely,\nmany of which are not owned or\noperated by us, could damage critical\nproduction, distribution or storage\nassets, delay or prevent delivery\nto\nmarkets,\nmake it difficult or impossible to accurately\naccount for production and settle\ntransactions, or negatively\nimpact public health or safety,\neconomic security, or\nnational security.\nAlthough we have experienced occasional\ncybersecurity incidents, none have had\na material effect on our\nbusiness, operations or reputation.\nAs cyberattacks have\ncontinued\nto evolve, we have become subject\nto new\ngovernment-imposed security requirements\nto implement specific mitigation measures\nto protect against\nransomware attacks\nand other known threats to information\nand operations technology.\nIn response, we must\ncontinually expend additional resources\nto continue to modify or enhance our protective\nmeasures or to\ninvestigate and\nremediate any vulnerabilities\ndetected.\nOur implementation of reasonable security\nprocedures\nand controls to monitor and mitigate\nsecurity threats and to increase security\nfor our information, facilities\nand\ninfrastructure may result\nin increased costs.\nDespite our ongoing investments\nin security resources, talent and\nbusiness practices, we are unable to assure\nthat any security measures will be completely\neffective.\nIf our systems and infrastructure\nwere to be breached, damaged or disrupted,\nwe could be subject to serious\nnegative consequences, including disruption\nof our operations, damage to our reputation,\na loss of counterparty\ntrust, reimbursement or other costs,\nincreased compliance costs, litigation\nexposure and legal liability or regulatory\nfines, penalties or intervention.\nIn addition, we have exposure to\ncybersecurity incidents and the negative\nimpacts\nof such incidents related to our data\nand proprietary information housed\non third-party IT systems, including\nthe\ncloud.\nAny of these could materially and adversel\ny\naffect our business, results of operations\nor financial condition,\nand any of the foregoing can\nbe exacerbated by a delay\nor failure to detect a cybersecurity\nincident or the full\nextent of such incident notwithstanding\nreasonable security procedures and controls.\nThe prevalence of remote\nworking during the pandemic has introduced\nadditional cybersecurity risk.\nAlthough we have business continuity\nplans in place, our operations may be adversely\naffected by significant\nand widespread disruption to our systems\nand infrastructure that support\nour business.\nWhile we continue to evolve and modify our business\ncontinuity\nplans, there can be no assurance that\nthey will be completely effective\nin avoiding disruption and business\nimpacts.\nFurther, our\ninsurance may not be adequate to\ncompensate us for all resulting\nlosses, and the cost to obtain\nadequate coverage may\nincrease for us in the future.\nConocoPhillips\n2021 10-K", "PERMNO": 13928, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "COP"}
