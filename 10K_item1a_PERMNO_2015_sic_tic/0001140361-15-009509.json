{"cik": "1388195", "company": "PharMerica CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the risks described below, together with all of the other information, in evaluating the Corporation and its common stock. If any of the risks described below actually occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business\nFinancial soundness of our customers and suppliers may adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf our customers\u2019 operating and financial performance deteriorates, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, our customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us. Any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. Additionally, both state and federal government sponsored payers, as a result of budget deficits or reductions, may seek to reduce their healthcare expenditures resulting in the long-term care customers renegotiating their contracts with us. Any reduction in payments by such government sponsored payers may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. Also some of our customers\u2019 real estate is owned by Real Estate Investment Trusts limiting their ability to renegotiate rental costs furthering their desire to reduce other controllable costs, such as pharmacy costs.\nIntense competition may erode our profit margins.\nThe distribution of pharmaceuticals to healthcare facilities is highly competitive. In each geographic market, there are national, regional and local institutional pharmacies and numerous local retail pharmacies, which provide services comparable to those offered by our pharmacies and may be more established in the markets they serve than we are. We also compete against regional and local pharmacies that specialize in long-term care. Many of our competitors have equal or greater resources and access to capital than the Corporation. In addition, local pharmacies have strong personal relationships with their customers. Because relatively few barriers to entry exist in the local markets we serve, we may encounter substantial competition from local market entrants. In addition, owners of skilled nursing facilities, including prior and current customers, are also entering the institutional pharmacy market, particularly in areas of their geographic concentration. Consolidation within the institutional pharmacy industry may also lead to increased competition. Competitive pricing pressures may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow.\nWe compete based on innovation and service as well as price. To attract new clients and retain existing clients, we must continually meet service expectations of our clients and customers. We cannot be sure that we will continue to remain competitive with the service to our clients at our current levels of profitability.\nIf we lose relationships with one or more key pharmaceutical manufacturers or if the payments made or discounts provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers decline, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe maintain contractual relationships with numerous pharmaceutical manufacturers that may provide us with, among other things:\n\u2022 discounts for drugs we purchase to be dispensed from our institutional pharmacies;\n\u2022 rebates based upon distributions of drugs from our institutional pharmacies; and\n\u2022 administrative fees for managing rebate programs.\nIf several of these contractual relationships are terminated or materially altered by the pharmaceutical manufacturers, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. In addition, formulary fee programs have been the subject of debate in federal and state legislatures and various other public and governmental forums. Changes in existing laws or regulations or in interpretations of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to any of these programs may materially adversely affect our business.\nCMS has questioned whether long-term care pharmacies should be permitted to receive discounts, rebates and other price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers with respect to prescriptions covered under the Medicare Part D benefit. Our business would be adversely affected if CMS should take any action that has the effect of eliminating or significantly reducing the rebates that we receive from pharmaceutical manufacturers.\nIndex\nOur operating revenue and profitability may suffer upon the occurrence of the loss of certain customers.\nWe have a number of customers that own or operate numerous facilities in our institutional pharmacy segment. In addition, our hospital revenues are primarily derived from one large multi-facility customer. If we are not able to continue these relationships or are only able to continue these relationships on less favorable terms than the ones currently in place, our operating revenues and results of operations would be materially impacted. There can be no assurance that these customers will not terminate all or a portion of their contracts with the Corporation.\nHome infusion joint ventures formed with hospitals could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe home infusion industry is currently seeing renewed activity in the formation of equity-based infusion joint ventures formed with hospitals. This activity stems, in part, from hospitals seeking to position themselves for new paradigms in the delivery of coordinated healthcare and new methods of payment, including an emerging interdisciplinary care model that is being labeled an \u201caccountable care organization\u201d. These organizations are encouraged by the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation. These entities are being designed in order to save money and improve quality of care by better integrating care, with the healthcare provider possibly sharing in the financial benefits of the improved efficiency.\nParticipation in equity-based joint ventures offers hospitals and other providers an opportunity to more efficiently transfer patients to less expensive care settings, while keeping the patient within its network. Additionally, it provides many hospitals with a mechanism to invest accumulated profits in a growing sector with attractive margins.\nIf home infusion joint ventures continue to expand and we lose referrals as a result, our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nOur operating revenue and profitability may suffer because of an increase in our generic dispensing rate.\nA shift in prescriptions dispensed from brand-to-generic and a decline in generic reimbursement rates from the PDP/PBMs may affect our operating revenue. When a branded drug shifts to a generic, initial pricing of the generic drug in the market will vary depending on the number of manufacturers launching their generic version of the drug. Historically a shift from brand-to-generic decreased our revenues and improved our gross margin from sales of these classes of drugs during the initial time period a brand drug has a generic alternative. However, recent experience has indicated that the third-party payers may reduce their reimbursements to the Corporation faster than previously experienced. This acceleration in the reimbursement reduction and the number of generic manufacturers have resulted in margin compression as multi-source alternatives have become available much earlier than we have historically experienced. In addition, the number of generic manufacturers entering the market impacts the overall cost and reimbursement of generic drugs. Due to the unique nature of the brand-to-generic conversion, management cannot estimate the future financial impact of the brand-to-generic conversions on its results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with complex and rapidly evolving laws and regulations, we could suffer penalties, be required to pay substantial damages or make significant changes to our operations.\nWe are subject to numerous federal and state regulations. If we fail to comply with existing or future applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties, including the loss of our licenses to operate our institutional pharmacies and our ability to participate in federal and state healthcare programs. As a consequence of the severe penalties we could face, we must devote significant operational and managerial resources to complying with these laws and regulations. Although we believe that we are substantially compliant with all existing statutes and regulations applicable to our business, different interpretations and enforcement policies of these laws and regulations could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality, or could require us to make significant changes to our operations. In addition, we cannot predict the impact of future legislation and regulatory changes on our business or assure that we will be able to obtain or maintain the regulatory approvals required to operate our business.\nAs a result of political, economic, and regulatory influences, the healthcare delivery industry in the United States is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes. We cannot predict which reform proposals will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us.\nThe costs associated with complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nIndex\nPharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns.\nUnexpected safety or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to marketed products, whether or not scientifically justified, leading to product recalls, withdrawals or declining sales. If we fail to or do not promptly withdraw pharmaceutical products upon a recall by a drug manufacturer, our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nLegal and regulatory changes reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and/or medical treatments or services may reduce our profitability.\nBoth our own profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates and charges. The sources and amounts of our revenues are determined by a number of factors, including licensed bed capacity and occupancy rates of our customers, the number of drugs administered to patients, the mix of pharmaceuticals dispensed, whether the drugs are brand or generic, and the rates of reimbursement among payers. Changes in the number of drugs administered to patients, as well as payer mix among private pay, Medicare and Medicaid, in our customers\u2019 facilities will significantly affect our earnings and cash flow.\nFurther modifications to the Medicare Part D program may reduce revenue and impose additional costs to the industry.\nThe Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 or MMA included a major expansion of the Medicare program with the addition of a prescription drug benefit under the new Medicare Part D program. The continued impact of these regulations depends upon a variety of factors, including our ongoing relationships with the Part D Plans and the patient mix of our customers. Future modifications to the Medicare Part D program may reduce revenue and impose additional costs to the industry. In addition, we cannot assure you that Medicare Part D and the regulations promulgated under Medicare Part D will not have a material adverse effect on our institutional pharmacy business.\nPossible changes in, or our failure to satisfy our manufacturers\u2019 rebate programs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that pharmaceutical manufacturers will continue to offer these rebates or that they will not change the terms upon which rebates are offered. A decrease in prescription volumes dispensed or a decrease in the number of brand or generic drugs which participate in rebate programs and are used by the geriatric population could affect our ability to satisfy our manufacturers\u2019 rebate programs. The termination of such programs or our failure to satisfy the criterion for earning rebates may have an adverse affect on our cost of goods sold, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nChanges in Medicaid reimbursement may reduce our revenue.\nThe 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation amended DRA to change the definition of the FUL by requiring the calculation of the FUL as no less than 175% of the weighted average, based on utilization, of the most recently reported monthly AMP for pharmaceutically and therapeutically equivalent multi-source drugs available through retail community pharmacies nationally.\nIn addition, the definition of AMP changed to reflect net sales only to drug wholesalers that distribute to retail community pharmacies and to retail community pharmacies that directly purchase from drug manufacturers. Further, the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation continues the current statutory exclusion of prompt pay discounts offered to wholesalers and adds three other exclusions to the AMP definition: i) bona fide services fees; ii) reimbursement for unsalable returned goods (recalled, expired, damaged, etc.); and iii) payments from and rebates/discounts to certain entities not conducting business as a wholesaler or retail community pharmacy. In addition to reporting monthly, the manufacturers are required to report the total number of units used to calculate each monthly AMP. CMS will use this information when it establishes FULs as a result of the new volume-weighted requirements pursuant to the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation.\nIn September 2011, CMS issued the first draft FUL reimbursement files for multiple source drugs, including the draft methodology used to calculate the FULs in accordance with the Health Care Legislation. CMS continues to release this monthly data and a three-month rolling average and is expected to do so going forward. CMS has not posted monthly AMPs for individual drugs, but only posted the weighted average of monthly AMPs in a FUL group and the calculation methodology.\nThe Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs website states that the final AMP was expected June 2014, but to date has not been released. Further, CMS has stated that AMP-based FULs will be published at or about the same time that CMS publishes the Medicaid Covered Outpatient Drug final rule, which, according to the latest unified agenda, is expected in April 2015. CMS will continue to post draft monthly FULs. The Corporation will continue to analyze the draft monthly FULs, including the relationship of those FULs to the National Average Drug Acquisition pricing.\nIndex\nAdverse results in material litigation matters or governmental inquiries could have a material adverse effect upon the Corporation\u2019s business.\nThe Corporation may from time to time become subject in the ordinary course of business to material legal action related to, among other things, intellectual property disputes, professional liability and employee-related matters, as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and Medicare or Medicaid carriers requesting comment and information on allegations of billing irregularities and other matters that are brought to their attention through billing audits, third parties or other sources. The healthcare industry is subject to substantial federal and state government regulation and audit. Legal actions could result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to the Corporation\u2019s reputation with customers, which could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nIf we or our customers fail to comply with Medicare and Medicaid regulations, we may be subjected to penalties or loss of eligibility to participate in these programs.\nThe Medicare and Medicaid programs are highly regulated. These programs are also subject to frequent and substantial changes. If we or our customers\u2019 facilities fail to comply with applicable reimbursement laws and regulations, whether purposely or inadvertently, our reimbursement under these programs could be curtailed or reduced and our eligibility to continue to participate in these programs could be adversely affected. Federal or state governments may also impose other penalties on us for failure to comply with the applicable reimbursement regulations. Failure by our customers to comply with these or future laws and regulations could result in our inability to provide pharmacy services to these customers and their residents. We do not believe that we have taken any actions that could subject us to material penalties under these rules and regulations.\nAmong these laws is the federal anti-kickback statute. This statute prohibits anyone from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration with the intent to refer, or to arrange for the referral or order of, services or items payable under a federal healthcare program. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly. Violations of the anti-kickback statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or imprisonment, civil money penalties of up to $50,000 per violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. This law impacts the relationships that we may have with potential referral sources. We have a variety of relationships with potential referral sources, including hospitals and skilled nursing facilities with which we have contracted to provide pharmacy services. The OIG, among other regulatory agencies, is responsible for identifying and eliminating fraud, abuse or waste. The OIG carries out this responsibility through a nationwide program of audits, investigations and inspections. The OIG has promulgated safe harbor regulations that outline practices that are deemed protected from prosecution under the anti-kickback statute. While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors, certain of our current arrangements may not qualify for safe harbor protection. Failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the anti-kickback statute, but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny. It cannot be assured that practices outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the anti-kickback statute.\nThe anti-kickback statute and similar state laws and regulations are expansive. We do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations. In the future, different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality, or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have violated these laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects and our business reputation could suffer significantly. If we fail to comply with the anti-kickback statute or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. In addition, we are unable to predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or their impact.\nContinuing government and private efforts to contain healthcare costs may reduce our future revenue.\nWe could be adversely affected by the continuing efforts of government and private payers to contain healthcare costs. To reduce healthcare costs, payers seek to lower reimbursement rates, limit the scope of covered services and negotiate reduced or capped pricing arrangements. While many of the proposed policy changes would require congressional approval to implement, we cannot assure you that reimbursement payments under governmental and private third party payer programs will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement under these programs. Any changes that lower reimbursement rates under Medicare, Medicaid or private pay programs could result in a substantial reduction in our net operating revenues. Our operating margins may continue to be under pressure because of deterioration in reimbursement, changes in payer mix and growth in operating expenses in excess of increases, if any, in payments by third party payers.\nIndex\nHealthcare reform could adversely affect the liquidity of our customers which would have an adverse effect on their ability to make timely payments to us for our products and services.\nHealthcare reform and legislation may have an adverse effect on our business through decreasing funds available to our customers. Limitations or restrictions on Medicare and Medicaid payments to our customers could adversely impact the liquidity of our customers, resulting in their inability to pay us, or to timely pay us, for our products and services. This inability could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nThe changing U.S. healthcare industry and increasing enforcement environment may negatively impact our business.\nOur products and services are part of the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently existing in the United States. In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending. These changes include an increased reliance on managed care, cuts in Medicare funding affecting our healthcare provider customer base and consolidation of competitors, suppliers and customers.\nWe expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Some of these potential changes, such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing, healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare providers to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services. If we are unable to adjust to changes in the healthcare environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nFurther, both federal and state government agencies have increased their focus on and coordination of civil and criminal enforcement efforts in the healthcare area. The OIG and the U.S. Department of Justice have, from time to time, established national enforcement initiatives, targeting all providers of a particular type, that focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of abuse. In addition, under the federal False Claims Act, private parties have the right to bring \u201cqui tam\u201d whistleblower lawsuits against companies that submit false claims for payments to the government. A number of states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. We do not believe that we have taken any actions that could subject us to material penalties under these provisions.\nFurther consolidation of managed care organizations and other third-party payers may adversely affect our profits.\nManaged care organizations and other third-party payers have continued to consolidate in order to enhance their ability to influence the delivery of healthcare services. Consequently, the healthcare needs of a large percentage of the U.S. population are increasingly served by a small number of managed care organizations. These organizations generally enter into service agreements with a limited number of providers for needed services. In addition, private payers, including managed care payers, increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures. To the extent that these organizations terminate us as a preferred provider, engage our competitors as a preferred or exclusive provider or demand discounted fee structures, our liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we or our customers fail to comply with licensure requirements, laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud or other applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.\nOur pharmacies must be licensed by the state board of pharmacy in the state in which they operate. Many states also regulate out-of-state pharmacies that are delivering prescription products to patients or residents in their states. The failure to obtain or renew any required regulatory approvals or licenses could adversely impact the operation of our business. In addition, the healthcare facilities we service are also subject to extensive federal, state and local regulations and are required to be licensed in the states in which they are located. The failure by these healthcare facilities to comply with these or future regulations or to obtain or renew any required licenses could result in our inability to provide pharmacy services to these facilities and their residents and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWhile we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws, many of the regulations applicable to us, including those relating to marketing incentives offered by pharmaceutical suppliers, and rebates paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. They may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. These changes may be material and may require the expenditure of material funds to implement. We believe that the regulatory environment surrounding most segments of the healthcare industry remains intense. Federal and state governments continue to impose intensive enforcement policies resulting in a significant number of inspections, citations of regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions including demands for refund of overpayments, terminations from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, bans on Medicare and Medicaid payments and fines. If we or our customers fail to comply with the extensive applicable laws and regulations, we could become ineligible to receive government program reimbursement, suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations. In addition, we could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under these laws or regulations regardless of whether we have actually been involved in any violations or wrong-doing.\nIndex\nFederal and state medical privacy regulations may increase the costs of operations and expose us to civil and criminal sanctions.\nWe must comply with extensive federal and state requirements regarding the transmission and retention of health information. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations, referred to as HIPAA, was enacted to ensure that employees can retain and at times transfer their health insurance when they change jobs, to enhance the privacy and security of personal health information and to simplify healthcare administrative processes. HIPAA requires the adoption of standards for the exchange of electronic health information.\nThe HITECH, part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, changed several aspects of HIPAA including, without limitation, the following: (i) applies HIPAA security provisions and penalties directly to business associates of covered entities; (ii) requires certain notifications in the event of a security breach involving PHI; (iii) restricts certain unauthorized disclosures; (iv) changes the treatment of certain marketing activities; and (v) strengthens enforcement activities. In addition, the Secretary of Health and Human Services issued an interim final rule on August 24, 2009 that requires notifications for certain unpermitted disclosures of PHI. The final rule was issued on January 17, 2013.\nFailure to comply with either HIPAA or HITECH could result in fines and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nAcquisitions, investments and strategic alliances that we have made or may make in the future may use significant resources, may be unsuccessful and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities.\nWe have made and anticipate that we may continue to make acquisitions of, investments in and strategic alliances with complementary businesses to enable us to capitalize on our position in the geographic markets in which we operate and to expand our businesses in new geographic markets. At any particular time, we may be in various stages of assessment, discussion and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances, not all of which, if any, will be consummated. Our acquisition program and strategy has and may lead us to contemplate acquisitions of companies in bankruptcy or financial distress, all of which entail additional risks and uncertainties. Such risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, that, before assets may be acquired, customers may leave in search of more stable providers and vendors may terminate key relationships. Also, assets are generally acquired on an \u201cas is\u201d basis, with no recourse to the seller if the assets are not as valuable as may be represented. Finally, while bankrupt companies may be acquired for comparatively little money, the cost of continuing the operations may significantly exceed expectations. Our growth plans rely, in part, on the successful completion of future acquisitions. If we are unsuccessful, our business would suffer.\nWe intend to make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate or required by applicable securities laws and regulations. Acquisitions may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, additional operating losses, amortization of certain intangible assets of acquired companies, and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:\n\u2022 difficulties integrating acquired operations, personnel and information systems, or in realizing projected efficiencies and cost savings;\n\u2022 diversion of management\u2019s time from existing operations;\n\u2022 potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired companies;\n\u2022 inaccurate assessment of assets and liabilities and exposure to undisclosed or unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies, including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws;\n\u2022 increases in our indebtedness and a limitation on our ability to access additional capital when needed; and\n\u2022 failure to operate acquired facilities profitably or to achieve improvements in their financial performance.\nIndex\nRisks generally associated with our sophisticated information systems may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely on sophisticated information systems in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze, and manage data to facilitate the dispensing of prescription and non-prescription pharmaceuticals in accordance with physician orders and deliver those medications to patients and long-term care residents on a timely basis; to manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers; and to process payments to suppliers. Our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if these systems are interrupted for any reason, including cyber security threats, or damaged or if they fail for an extended period of time. Significant disruptions to our infrastructure or any of our facilities due to failure of technology or some other catastrophic event could adversely impact our business.\nWe purchase a significant portion of our pharmaceutical products from one supplier.\nWe are required to purchase a substantial amount of our pharmaceutical products from ABDC, pursuant to the Amended PVA. If ABDC fails to deliver products in accordance with the Amended PVA, there can be no assurance that our operations would not be disrupted or that we could obtain the products at similar cost or at all. In this event, failure to satisfy our customers\u2019 requirements would result in defaults under these customer contracts subjecting us to damages and the potential termination of those contracts. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, under the terms of the Amended PVA, the Corporation is limited in our ability to negotiate potentially better pricing and other terms with other drug distributors, which could negatively impact our competitive position. On March 2, 2015, we provided ABDC with a notice of termination of the Amended PVA effective April 1, 2015. We have entered into a new Prime Vendor Agreement with Cardinal Health effective April 1, 2015. See Item 9B below.\nA loss in rebates and other pricing terms under the Amended PVA may adversely impact our financial results.\nOn January 4, 2011, the Corporation entered into the Amended PVA for Long-Term Care Pharmacies. On January 25, 2013 the Corporation renegotiated its Amended PVA with ABDC effective January 1, 2013. The Amended PVA modifies the previous agreement, which was set to expire September 30, 2013 and extends its term until September 30, 2016. The First Amendment requires the Corporation to purchase certain levels of brand and non-injectable generic drugs from ABDC. The Amended PVA does provide the flexibility for the Corporation to contract with other suppliers. If the Corporation fails to adhere to the contractual purchase provisions ABDC has the ability to increase the Corporation's drug pricing under the terms of the Amended PVA. On September 10, 2014, the Corporation filed a Complaint in Jefferson Circuit Court in Louisville, Kentucky against ABDC for breach of the Amended PVA. The Corporation subsequently filed a First Amended Complaint asserting additional breaches of the Amended PVA. The amounts disputed by ABDC generally relate to certain rebates owed by ABDC under the Amended PVA, which are $8.5 million, $12.3 million, and $20.0 million for the second quarter of 2014, the third quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2014, respectively. The Corporation believes the aggregate amount of its claims were $40.8 million as of December 31, 2014 which is reflected as a receivable and included in prepaids and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The Corporation will have claims for additional damages resulting from ABDC's breaches of the Amended PVA. The Corporation intends to vigorously pursue its claims. The Corporation is unable to determine the ultimate impact of these litigation proceedings on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. The litigation with ABDC could continue for an extended period of time, likely longer than 12 months. The Corporation cannot provide any assurances about the outcome of the litigation. A loss in rebates and/or other pricing terms under the Amended PVA may adversely impact our financial results. On March 2, 2015, the Corporation provided ABDC with a notice of termination of the Amended PVA effective April 1, 2015. We have entered into a new Prime Vendor Agreement with Cardinal Health effective April 1, 2015. See Item 9B below.\nPrescription volumes may decline, and our net revenues and profitability may be negatively impacted, if products are withdrawn from the market or if increased safety risk profiles of specific drugs result in utilization decreases.\nWe dispense significant volumes of drugs from our pharmacies. These volumes are the basis for our net revenues and profitability. When increased safety risk profiles of specific drugs or classes of drugs result in utilization decreases, physicians may cease writing or reduce the numbers of prescriptions written for these drugs. Additionally, negative press regarding drugs with higher safety risk profiles may result in reduced consumer demand for such drugs. On occasion, products are withdrawn by their manufacturers. In cases where there are no acceptable prescription drug equivalents or alternatives for these prescription drugs, our volumes, net revenues, profitability and cash flows may decline.\nIndex\nWe could be required to record a material non-cash charge to income if our recorded goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, or if we shorten intangible asset useful lives.\nWe have $317.7 million of goodwill and $177.6 million of recorded intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014. Our intangible assets primarily represent the value of client relationships that were recorded from past acquisitions. Under current accounting rules, intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. These assets may become impaired with the loss of significant clients. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the undiscounted pre-tax expected future cash flows from the lowest appropriate asset grouping, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge to our consolidated income statements in the amount the carrying value of these assets exceeds its fair value. In addition, while the intangible assets may not be impaired, the useful lives are subject to continual assessment, taking into account historical and expected losses of relationships that were in the base at time of acquisition. This assessment may result in a reduction of the remaining weighted average useful life of these assets, resulting in potentially significant increases to non-cash amortization expense that is charged to our consolidated income statements. A goodwill or intangible asset impairment charge, or a reduction of useful lives, could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent on our senior management team and our pharmacy professionals.\nWe are highly dependent upon the members of our senior management and our pharmacists and other pharmacy professionals. Our business is managed by a small number of senior management personnel. If we were unable to retain these persons, we might be materially adversely affected due to the limited pool of senior management personnel with significant experience in our industry. Accordingly, we believe we could experience significant difficulty in replacing key management personnel. We expect that any employment contracts we enter into with our key management personnel will be subject to termination without cause by either party. Moreover, although the majority of the members of our senior management team have significant experience in the industry, they will need time to fully assess and understand our business and operations. We can offer no assurance how long these members of senior management will choose to remain with us.\nIn addition, our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain pharmacists and other pharmacy professionals. Competition for qualified pharmacists and other pharmacy professionals is intense. The loss of pharmacy personnel or the inability to attract or retain sufficient numbers of qualified pharmacy professionals could adversely affect our business. Although we generally have been able to meet our staffing requirements for pharmacists and other pharmacy professionals, our inability to do so in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur revenues and volume trends may be adversely affected by certain factors relevant to the markets in which we have pharmacies, including weather conditions and other natural disasters, some of which may not be covered by insurance.\nOur revenues and volume trends will be predicated on many factors, including physicians\u2019 pharmaceutical decisions on patients, payer programs, seasonal and severe weather conditions including the effects of extreme low temperatures, hurricanes and tornadoes, earthquakes, current local economic and demographic changes, some of which may not be covered by insurance. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and volume trends, and many of these factors will not be within the control of our management. These factors may also have an effect on our customers and their ability to continue to operate. For further discussion, see Note 9.\nThere are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments, and assumptions used in the determination of our litigation-related accruals and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). Any changes in estimates, judgments, and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur financial statements filed with the SEC are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the preparation of such financial statements includes making estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and related reserves, revenues, expenses, and income. We evaluate our exposure to legal proceedings and establish reserves for the estimated liabilities in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties. Unexpected outcomes in these legal proceedings, or changes in management's evaluations or predictions and accompanying changes in established reserves, could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Estimates are inherently subject to change in the future, and such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets, liabilities, income, or expenses and likewise could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIndex\nRisk Factors Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock and Our Senior Secured Credit Facility\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control that stockholders favor.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable or may impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our management and Board of Directors. The provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, among other things:\n\u2022 prohibit stockholder action except at an annual or special meeting. Specifically, this means our stockholders are unable to act by written consent;\n\u2022 regulate how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at annual meetings of stockholders. Advance notice of such proposals or nominations is required;\n\u2022 regulate how special meetings of stockholders may be called. Our stockholders do not have the right to call special meetings;\n\u2022 authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series, without stockholder approval. Under this authority, our Board of Directors adopted the Rights Agreement which could ensure continuity of management by rendering it more difficult for a potential acquirer to obtain control of us; and\n\u2022 require an affirmative vote of the holders of three-quarters or more of the combined voting power of our common stock entitled to vote in the election of our directors in order for the stockholders to amend our bylaws.\nIn addition, because we have not chosen to be exempt from Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that some stockholders may view as favorable. Section 203 provides that unless board and/or stockholder approval is obtained pursuant to the requirements of the statute, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliate becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including, without limitation the following:\n\u2022 as a result of the risk factors listed in this document;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022 for reasons unrelated to our specific performance, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions, or negative announcements by our customers or competitors regarding their own performance;\n\u2022 regulatory changes that could impact our business or that of our customers; and\n\u2022 general economic and industry conditions.\nIn addition, when the market price of a company\u2019s common stock drops significantly, stockholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company. A lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources.\nAcquisitions, investments and strategic alliances we may make in the future may need to be financed by borrowings under the Credit Agreement for which funds may not be made available by certain participants.\nWe have made and anticipate that we may continue to make acquisitions of, investments in and strategic alliances with complementary businesses to enable us to capitalize on our position in the geographic markets in which we operate and to expand our business in new geographic markets. Our growth plans rely, in part, on the successful completion of future acquisitions. At any particular time, we may need to finance such acquisitions and strategic alliances with borrowings under the Credit Agreement. The financial markets are very volatile and certain participants in our Credit Agreement may not be able to participate in funding their commitments under the revolving line of credit. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining the financing, our business would be impacted.\nIndex\nWe are exposed to interest rate changes.\nWe are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding debt of $350.0 million outstanding under our Credit Agreement and revolver, all of which was subject to variable rates of interest. See Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\u201d\nWe have indebtedness, which restricts our ability to pay cash dividends and has a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity.\nWe have $350.0 million in indebtedness outstanding as of December 31, 2014 under our Credit Agreement and revolver. We also have $1.3 million in capital lease obligations at December 31, 2014.\nOn September 17, 2014, the Corporation entered into a Credit Agreement by and among the Corporation, the lenders named therein, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A., as syndication agent, and U.S. Bank, National Association, Citibank, N.A., MUFG Union Bank, N.A., BBVA Compass Bank and SunTrust Bank as co-documentation agents (the \"Credit Agreement\"). The Credit Agreement replaced the $450.0 million five-year credit agreement dated as of May 2, 2011, among the Corporation, Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and certain lenders. The Credit Agreement consists of a $225.0 million term loan facility and a $310.0 million revolving credit facility. The terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement are customary to facilities of this nature. Unless terminated earlier, the Credit Agreement will mature on September 17, 2019, and the principal amount outstanding thereunder, together with all accrued unpaid interest and other amounts owed thereunder, if any, will be payable in full on such date. The Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants that require us to satisfy certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum of debt to EBITDA ratio. The Credit Agreement limits our ability to declare and pay dividends or other distributions on our shares of common stock. If our lenders permit us to declare dividends, the dividend amounts, if any, will be determined by our Board of Directors, which will consider a number of factors, including our financial condition, capital requirements, funds generated from operations, future business prospects, applicable contractual restrictions and any other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant. The amount of this outstanding indebtedness could limit our ability to pay cash dividends and to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditure and acquisition purposes. A significant portion of our cash flows will be dedicated to debt service and will be unavailable for investment, capital expenditures or other operating expenses.\nAs a result of these and other factors, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we do not generate or are unable to borrow sufficient amounts of cash on satisfactory terms to meet these needs, we may need to seek to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, sell assets, curtail discretionary capital expenditures or seek additional capital. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, liquidity, capital resources, and financial condition.\nWe anticipate that future earnings will be used principally to support operations and finance the growth of our business. Thus, we do not intend to pay dividends or other cash distributions on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
