{"cik": "1506251", "company": "Citius Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-12-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this report.\nIf any of the following risks, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant, develop into actual events, then our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. If that happens, the market price of our securities could decline, and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and our Industry\nWe have a history of net losses and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We may never generate revenues or, if we are able to generate revenues, achieve profitability.\nWe were formed in 2007 and since our inception have incurred a net loss in each of our previous operating years. Our ability to become profitable depends upon our ability to obtain marketing approval for and generate revenues from sales of our product candidates. We have been focused on product development, have not received approval for any of our product candidates, and have not generated any revenues to date. We have incurred losses in each period of our operations, and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. These losses are likely to continue to adversely affect our working capital, total assets, and stockholders\u2019 equity. The process of developing our product candidates requires significant clinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials. In addition, commercialization of our product candidates will require that we obtain necessary regulatory approvals and establish sales, marketing, and manufacturing capabilities, either through internal hiring or through contractual relationships with others. We expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future as a result of anticipated increases in our research and development costs, including costs associated with conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials, and regulatory compliance activities. We incurred net losses of $33,640,646 and $23,054,434 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At September 30, 2022, we had stockholders\u2019 equity of $102,825,865 and an accumulated deficit of $129,688,467. Our net cash used in operating activities was $28,361,256 and $24,250,414 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOur ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability will depend on numerous factors, including success in:\n\u25cf developing and testing product candidates;\n\u25cf receiving regulatory approvals for our product candidates;\n\u25cf commercializing our product candidates that receive regulatory approval;\n\u25cf manufacturing commercial quantities of our product candidates at acceptable cost levels;\n\u25cf obtaining medical insurance coverage for any approved product candidate; and\n\u25cf establishing a favorable competitive position for any approved product candidates.\nMany of these factors will depend on circumstances beyond our control. We cannot assure you that any of our product candidates will be approved by the FDA or any foreign regulatory body or obtain medical insurance coverage, that we will successfully bring any approved product to market or, if so, that we will ever become profitable.\nAbility to continue as a going concern.\nAt September 30, 2022, we estimated that we have sufficient capital to continue our operations through December 2023. You should not rely on our consolidated balance sheet as an indication of the amount of proceeds that would be available to satisfy claims of creditors, and potentially be available for distribution to stockholders, in the event of liquidation.\nThe Company has generated no operating revenue to date and has principally raised capital through the issuance of debt and equity instruments to finance its operations. However, the Company\u2019s continued operations beyond December 2023, including its development plans for I/ONTAK, Mino-Lok, Halo-Lido, Mino-Wrap and NoveCite, will depend on its ability to obtain regulatory approval to market I/ONTAK and/or Mino-Lok and generate substantial revenue from the sale of I/ONTAK and/or Mino-Lok and on its ability to raise additional capital through various potential sources, such as equity and/or debt financings, strategic relationships, or out-licensing of its product candidates. However, the Company can provide no assurances on the approval, commercialization, or future sales of I/ONTAK and/or Mino-Lok or that financing or strategic relationships will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient capital, find strategic partners or generate substantial revenue from the sale of I/ONTAK and/or Mino-Lok, there would be a material adverse effect on its business. Further, the Company expects in the future to incur additional expenses as it continues to develop its product candidates, including seeking regulatory approval, and protecting its intellectual property.\nWe need to secure additional financing in the future to complete the development of our current product candidates and support our operations.\nWe anticipate that we will incur operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue developing our product candidates. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf the rate of progress and cost of our trials and other product development and commercialization programs for our current product candidates;\n\u25cf the costs and timing of obtaining licenses for additional product candidates or acquiring other complementary technologies;\n\u25cf the timing of any regulatory approvals of any of our product candidates;\n\u25cf the costs of establishing or contracting for sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities for our product candidates; and\n\u25cf the status, terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, co-promotion, or other arrangements.\nWe will need to access the capital markets in the future for additional capital for research and development and for operations. As of the date of this report, we do not anticipate seeking additional capital until sometime in 2023. Traditionally, pharmaceutical companies have funded their research and development expenditures through raising capital in the equity markets. Declines and uncertainties in these markets over the past several years have severely restricted raising new capital and have affected companies\u2019 abilities to continue to expand or fund existing research and development efforts. The COVID-19 pandemic could also adversely impact future fundraising activities. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related and/or other economic conditions continue or become worse, our future cost of equity or debt capital and access to the capital markets could be adversely affected. If we are not successful in securing additional financing, we may be required to significantly delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs, downsize our general and administrative infrastructure, or seek alternative measures to avoid insolvency, including arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates.\nWe are primarily a late-stage development company with an unproven business strategy and may never achieve commercialization of our therapeutic product candidates or profitability.\nWe have no approved products. All of our current product candidates are in the pre-clinical or clinical stage. We rely on third parties to conduct the research and development activities for our product candidates. Further, we have no sales or marketing capability at this time. Even if we decide to use collaborative partners to assist us in the commercialization of our product candidates, our product commercialization capabilities are unproven. Our success will depend upon our ability to develop such capabilities on our own or to enter into collaboration agreements on favorable terms and to select an appropriate commercialization strategy for each product candidate that we choose to pursue and that receives approval, whether on our own or in collaboration. If we are not successful in implementing our strategy to commercialize our product candidates, we may never achieve, maintain, or increase profitability. Our ability to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates will depend, among other things, on our ability to:\n\u25cf successfully complete pre-clinical and clinical trials for our product candidates;\n\u25cf receive marketing approvals from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities for our product candidates;\n\u25cf establish commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers for our product candidates;\n\u25cf produce, through a validated process, sufficiently large quantities of our drug compound(s) to permit successful commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u25cf build and maintain strong sales, distribution, and marketing capabilities sufficient to launch commercial sales of any approved products or establish collaborations with third parties for such commercialization;\n\u25cf secure acceptance of any approved products from physicians, health care payers, patients, and the medical community; and\n\u25cf manage our spending as costs and expenses increase due to clinical trials, regulatory applications and development and commercialization activities.\nThere are no guarantees that we will be successful in completing these tasks. If we are unable to successfully complete these tasks, we may not be able to commercialize any of our product candidates in a timely manner, or at all, in which case we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to sustain and grow our business. If we experience unanticipated delays or problems, our development costs could substantially increase and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe have a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nWe have two late-stage stage product candidates while our other product candidates are clinical stage. As a result, our success is dependent upon our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates and we, as a company, have not demonstrated an ability to perform the functions necessary for the approval or successful commercialization of any product candidates. While various members of our executive management and key employees have significant prior experience in pharmaceutical development, as a company we have to date successfully completed only one late-stage clinical trial and are just beginning to undertake commercialization activities, in each case for I/ONTAK. Despite our progress with I/ONTAK, our operations have been limited primarily to business planning, acquiring our proprietary technology, research and development, recruiting management and technical staff, and raising capital. These operations provide a limited basis for you to assess our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and the advisability of investing in our securities.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may materially and adversely affect our clinical trial operations and our financial results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted hospitals and medical facilities where we are currently conducting our Mino-Lok phase 3 trial. The full extent to which COVID-19 may impact this trial is not known at this time, but it has slowed the estimated completion date for the trial, which we now expect to be in 2023. This same risk applies to our recently begun Phase 2b trial for Halo-Lido and our planned clinical trials for our other product candidates. The exact duration of the delay and any other impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the duration of the outbreak, the severity of COVID-19, or the effectiveness of actions to contain and treat for COVID-19. The continued spread of COVID-19 also could adversely impact our ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19, which could further negatively impact the Mino-Lok and Halo-Lido trials. In addition, if the FDA elects to delay face-to-face meetings for an extended period of time due to COVID-19, it could have a material adverse effect on our Mino-Lok and Halo-Lido trials and our other product candidates. Any or all of these events could increase our operating expenses and the length of time to complete a trial and have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe may choose not to continue developing any of our product candidates at any time during development, which would reduce or eliminate our potential return on investment for those product candidates.\nAt any time, we may decide to discontinue the development of any of our product candidates for a variety of reasons, including inadequate financial resources, the appearance of new technologies that render our product candidates obsolete, competition from a competing product or changes in or failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. If we terminate a program in which we have invested significant resources, we will not receive any return on our investment and we will have missed the opportunity to allocate those resources to potentially more productive uses.\nAs an example, on July 1, 2016, we announced that we were discontinuing the development of Suprenza, which was our first commercial product candidate, for strategic reasons and not due to safety or regulatory concerns, in order to focus our management and cash resources on the Phase 3 development of Mino-Lok and the Phase 2b development of Halo-Lido. The resources expended on Suprenza therefore did not provide us any benefit.\nWe face significant risks in our product candidate development efforts.\nOur business depends on the successful development and commercialization of our product candidates. We are not permitted to market any of our product candidates in the United States until we receive approval from the FDA, or in any foreign jurisdiction until we receive the requisite approvals from such jurisdiction. The process of developing new drugs and/or therapeutic products is inherently complex, unpredictable, time-consuming, expensive and uncertain. We must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our development programs will result in products that will receive regulatory approval and achieve market acceptance. Product candidates that appear to be promising at some or all stages of development may not receive approval or reach the market for a number of reasons that may not be predictable based on results and data of the clinical program. Product candidates may be found ineffective or may cause harmful side effects during clinical trials, may take longer to progress through clinical trials than had been anticipated, may not be able to achieve the pre-defined clinical endpoints due to statistical anomalies even though clinical benefit may have been achieved, may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals, may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost and with acceptable quality, or may fail to achieve market acceptance.\nWe cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates that are under development and we cannot, therefore, predict the timing of any future revenues from these product candidates, if any. The FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. For example, the FDA:\n\u25cf\nmay not find the data from clinical trials, including from our Phase 3 trial for I/ONTAK, sufficient to support the submission of an NDA or BLA or to obtain marketing approval in the United States, including any findings that the clinical and other benefits of our product candidates outweigh their safety risks;\n\u25cf could determine that the information provided by us was inadequate, contained clinical deficiencies or otherwise failed to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of any of our product candidates for any indication;\n\u25cf\nmay disagree with our trial design or our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials, or may change the requirements for approval even after it has reviewed and commented on the design for our trials;\n\u25cf could determine that we cannot rely on Section 505(b)(2) for Mino-Lok or Halo-Lido or any future product candidate whose composition includes components previously approved by the FDA;\n\u25cf may determine that we have identified the wrong reference listed drug or drugs or that approval of a Section 505(b)(2) application for any of our product candidates is blocked by patent or non-patent exclusivity of the reference listed drug or drugs;\n\u25cf may identify deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we enter into agreements for the manufacture of our product candidates;\n\u25cf may approve our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, or may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-approval clinical trials;\n\u25cf may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations that could adversely impact our product candidate development programs; or\n\u25cf may not approve the labeling claims that we believe are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates, or may require labeling claims that impair the potential market acceptance of our product candidates.\nThese same risks are generally applicable to the regulatory process in foreign countries. Any failure to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates would significantly limit our ability to generate revenues, and any failure to obtain such approval for all of the indications and labeling claims we deem desirable could reduce our potential revenues.\nWhile our business strategy generally is to focus on the development of late-stage product candidates to lessen the development risk, there is still significant risk to successfully developing a product candidate.\nOur goal in generally pursuing late-stage therapeutic product candidates with what we believe is a promising pre-clinical and early clinical stage track record is to avoid the risk of failure at the pre-clinical and early clinical stages. However, there is still significant risk to obtaining regulatory approval and successfully commercializing any late-stage product candidate that we pursue. All of the risks inherent in drug development of initial stage product candidates also apply to late-stage candidates. We cannot assure you that our business strategy will be successful.\nThe results of pre-clinical studies and completed clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and our current product candidates may not have favorable results in later studies or trials.\nPre-clinical studies and Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials are not primarily designed to test the efficacy of a product candidate in the general population, but rather to test initial safety, to study pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, to study limited efficacy in a small number of study patients in a selected disease population, and to identify and attempt to understand the product candidate\u2019s side effects at various doses and dosing schedules. Success in pre-clinical studies or completed clinical trials does not ensure that later studies or trials, including continuing pre-clinical studies and large-scale clinical trials, will be successful nor does it predict future results. Favorable results in early studies or trials may not be repeated in later studies or trials, and product candidates in later stage trials may fail to show acceptable safety and efficacy despite having progressed through earlier trials. In addition, the placebo rate in larger studies may be higher than expected.\nWe may be required to demonstrate through large, long-term outcome trials that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in a broad population prior to obtaining regulatory approval. This would increase the duration and cost of any such trial.\nThere is typically a high rate of attrition from the failure of product candidates proceeding through clinical trials. In addition, certain subjects in our clinical trials may respond positively to placebo treatment - these subjects are commonly known as \u201cplacebo responders\u201d - making it more difficult to demonstrate efficacy of the trial drug compared to placebo. This effect is likely to be observed in the treatment of hemorrhoids, which could negatively impact the development program for Halo-Lido.\nIf any of our product candidates fail to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in any clinical trial, we will experience potentially significant delays and cost increases in, or may decide to abandon development of, that product candidate. If we abandon or are delayed, or experience increased costs, in our development efforts related to any of our product candidates, we may not have sufficient resources to continue or complete development of that product candidate or any other product candidates. We may not be able to continue our operations and clinical studies, or generate any revenue or become profitable. Our reputation in the industry and in the investment community would likely be significantly damaged. Further, it might not be possible for us to raise funds in the public or private markets, and our stock price would likely decrease significantly.\nWe might not decide to proceed with the proposed spinoff of our I/ONTAK asset.\nIn May 2022, we announced that we intend to split the Company\u2019s assets into two separate publicly traded entities. We plan to form a new company focused on developing and commercializing I/ONTAK. Our other pipeline assets, including Mino-Lok, would remain at Citius. Citius would continue to trade on the Nasdaq exchange under its current ticker CTXR. The strategic action is intended to optimize organizational resources and investment capital to support the successful execution of each development program. The transactions are expected to be completed in calendar year 2023, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including final approval from the Citius Board of Directors, market conditions, regulatory approvals, and SEC filings. However, there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the proposed transaction or that the transaction will be completed at all.\nIf we are unable to file for approval of Mino-Lok or Halo-Lido under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or if we are required to generate additional data related to safety and efficacy in order to obtain approval of Mino-Lok or Halo-Lido under Section 505(b)(2), we may be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines.\nOur current plans for filing NDAs or BLAs for our product candidates include efforts to minimize the data we will be required to generate in order to obtain marketing approval for certain of our product candidates and therefore possibly reduce the time and cost of development of a product candidate and obtain a shortened review period for the application. The timeline for filing and review of our planned NDA for each of Mino-Lok and Halo-Lido is based upon our plan to submit each such NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, wherein we will rely in part on data generated by third parties and that is in the public domain or elsewhere. Depending on the data that may be required by the FDA for approval, some of the data may be related to products already approved by the FDA. If the data relied upon is related to products already approved by the FDA and covered by third-party patents, we would be required to certify that we do not infringe the listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable. As a result of the certification, the third party would have 45 days from notification of our certification to initiate an action against us. In the event that an action is brought in response to such a certification, the approval of our NDA could be subject to a stay of up to 30 months or more while we defend against such a suit. Approval of any product candidate under Section 505(b)(2) may therefore be delayed until patent exclusivity expires or until we successfully challenge the applicability of those patents applicable to our product candidates. Alternatively, we may elect to generate sufficient additional clinical data so that we no longer rely on data which triggers a potential stay of the approval of any product candidate. Even if no exclusivity periods apply to an application under Section 505(b)(2), the FDA has broad discretion to require us to generate additional data on the safety and efficacy of our product candidates to supplement third-party data on which we may be permitted to rely. In either event, we could be required, before obtaining marketing approval for such product candidate, to conduct substantial new research and development activities beyond those in which we currently plan to engage in order to obtain approval of that product candidate. Such additional new research and development activities would be costly and time consuming.\nWe may not be able to obtain shortened review of our applications where available, and in any event the FDA may not agree that any of our product candidates qualify for marketing approval. If we are required to generate additional data to support approval, we may be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines, may be unable to generate the additional data at a reasonable cost, or at all, and may be unable to obtain marketing approval of that product candidate. In addition, notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years, some pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA changes its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2), or if the FDA\u2019s interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) application that we submit.\nTwo of our product candidates, Mino-Lok and Halo-Lido, are combination products consisting of components that have each been separately approved by the FDA for other indications and which are commercially available and marketed by other companies. Our approval under Section 505(b)(2), if received, would not preclude physicians, pharmacists, and patients from obtaining individual drug products and titrating the dosage of these drug products as close to our approved dose as possible.\nOur Mino-Lok solution contains minocycline, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edetate), and ethyl alcohol, all of which have been separately approved by the FDA for other indications or are used as excipients in other parenteral products. Assuming FDA approval as a branded pharmaceutical product, we would need to obtain hospital formulary acceptance to generate sales of Mino-Lok. Additionally, we may encounter reluctance by the infectious disease physician community to vary from the existing standard of care to remove and replace an infected catheter. Currently, hospitals are reimbursed for the treatment of CRBSIs by the Center for Medicare and Medicare Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) through a Diagnosis Related Group (\u201cDRG\u201d) classification or code. Commercial insurance plans reimburse for CRBSIs in a similar manner. With Mino-Lok being priced as a branded FDA-approved pharmaceutical product, this could result in the participating hospital retaining a lower share of CMS or commercial reimbursement which may impact the acceptance and use of Mino-Lok by these institutions.\nOur Halo-Lido product candidate for the treatment of hemorrhoids is a combination product consisting of two drugs, halobetasol propionate, a corticosteroid, and lidocaine, that have each been separately approved by the FDA for other indications and which are commercially available and marketed by other companies. Halobetasol propionate cream is available in a 0.05% strength, and lidocaine creams are also available in strengths up to 5%. From our market analysis and discussions with a limited number of physicians, we know that patients sometimes obtain two separate cream products and co-administer them as prescribed, giving them a combination treatment that could be very similar to what we intend to study and seek approval for. As a branded, FDA-approved product with safety and efficacy data, we intend to price our product substantially higher than the generically available individual creams. We will then have to convince third-party payers and pharmacy benefit managers of the advantages of our product and justify our premium pricing. We may encounter resistance from these entities and will then be dependent on patients\u2019 willingness to pay the premium and not seek alternatives. In addition, pharmacists often suggest lower cost prescription treatment alternatives to both physicians and patients. If approved, our Section 505(b)(2) approval and the market exclusivity we may receive will not guarantee that such alternatives will not exist, that substitution will not occur, or that there will be immediate or any acceptance to our pricing by payer formularies.\nAny fast track designation or grant of priority review status by the FDA may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, nor will it assure FDA approval of our product candidates. Additionally, our product candidates may treat indications that do not qualify for priority review vouchers.\nWe have received fast track designation for Mino-Lok to treat and salvage infected central venous catheters in patients with CRBSIs. We may seek fast track designation for some of our other product candidates or priority review of applications for approval of our product candidates for certain indications. If a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the drug sponsor may apply for the FDA fast track designation. If a product candidate offers major advances in treatment, the FDA may designate it eligible for priority review. The FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant these designations, so even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for these designations, we cannot assure you that the FDA would decide to grant them. Even with the fast track designation for Mino-Lok and if we do receive fast track designation or priority review for any other product candidate, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw fast track designation from Mino-Lok or any other product candidate to be so designated if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program.\nWe do not own NoveCite, Inc. outright and will share any benefits from the development of its NoveCite product candidate with the other stockholder.\nAs of November 30, 2022, we owned 75% of the outstanding common stock of NoveCite. As a result, we will only be entitled to a portion of any benefits that flow from the development by NoveCite of its NoveCite product candidate or any other product candidates that it might develop. In the event that NoveCite issues additional equity securities in the future this would likely reduce our percentage ownership, which would further reduce the portion of any benefit that might be derived from the NoveCite drug candidate\u2019s successful development, unless we were to increase our investment.\nAny FDA programs related to the development and approval of treatments for COVID-19 and its symptoms may not be available to us or actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process for NoveCite, our proposed treatment for ARDS, nor will it assure FDA approval of such a treatment.\nWe intend to develop NoveCite under the FDA\u2019s Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program, or CTAP. The CTAP program was designed to accelerate the development of COVID-19 treatments via faster communications and regulatory review protocols. In late April 2020, we made a pre-IND submission to the FDA for this treatment and requested the FDA\u2019s feedback to support the most expeditious pathway for clinical development of the therapy. The CTAP program is relatively new and the FDA has broad discretion in administering the CTAP program and therefore we cannot assure you what the FDA might decide. Even though we believe that the response from the FDA was favorable, we did not specifically request guidance on the CTAP program. As a result, we may encounter problems at a later date under the CTAP program, or with the therapy itself, and we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures.\nBecause our NoveCite product candidate is based on novel technologies, it is difficult to predict the regulatory approval process and the time, the cost and our ability to successfully initiate, conduct and complete clinical development, and obtain the necessary regulatory and reimbursement approvals, required for commercialization of our NoveCite product candidate.\nNoveCite\u2019s cell programming technology and platform for generating cell therapy products using allogenic mesenchymal stem cells derived from iPSCs represent novel therapeutic approaches, and to our knowledge there are currently no iPSC-derived cell products approved anywhere in the world for commercial sale. As such, it is difficult to accurately predict the type and scope of challenges that NoveCite may incur during development of its NoveCite product candidate, and it faces uncertainties associated with the preclinical and clinical development, manufacture and regulatory requirements for the initiation and conduct of clinical trials, regulatory approval, and reimbursement required for successful commercialization of its NoveCite product candidate. In addition, because NoveCite\u2019s iPSC-derived cell product candidate is in the pre-clinical stage, NoveCite is currently assessing safety in humans and has not yet been able to assess the long-term effects of treatment. Animal models and assays may not accurately predict the safety and efficacy of our product candidate in our target patient populations, and appropriate models and assays may not exist for demonstrating the safety and purity of the NoveCite product candidate, as required by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for ongoing clinical development and regulatory approval.\nThe pre-clinical and clinical development, manufacture, and regulatory requirements for approval of the NoveCite product candidate may be more expensive and take longer than for other more well-known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical product candidates due to a lack of prior experiences on the side of both developers and regulatory agencies. Additionally, due to the uncertainties associated with the pre-clinical and clinical development, manufacture, and regulatory requirements for approval of the NoveCite product candidate, NoveCite may be required to modify or change its pre-clinical and clinical development plans or its manufacturing activities and plans or be required to meet stricter regulatory requirements for approval. Any such modifications or changes could delay or prevent NoveCite\u2019s ability to develop, manufacture, obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize its NoveCite product candidate, which would adversely affect NoveCite\u2019s and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCellular immunotherapies, and stem cell therapies and iPSC-derived cell therapies in particular, represent relatively new therapeutic areas, and the FDA has cautioned consumers about potential safety risks associated with cell therapies. To date, there are relatively few approved cell therapies. As a result, the regulatory approval process for a product candidate such as NoveCite is uncertain and may be more expensive and take longer than the approval process for product candidates based on other, better known or more extensively studied technologies and therapeutic approaches. For example, there are currently no FDA approved products with a label designation that supports the use of a product to treat and reduce the severity of ARDS in patients with COVID-19, which makes it difficult to determine the clinical endpoints and data required to support an application or regulatory approval, and the time and cost required to obtain regulatory approval in the United States for our product candidate.\nRegulatory requirements in the United States governing cell therapy products have changed frequently and the FDA or other regulatory bodies may change the requirements, or identify different regulatory pathways, for approval of the NoveCite product candidate. For example, within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, restructured and created a new Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies to better align its oversight activities with FDA Centers for Drugs and Medical Devices. It is possible that over time new or different divisions may be established or be granted the responsibility for regulating cell and/or gene therapy products, including iPSC-derived cell products, such as the NoveCite product candidate. As a result, NoveCite may be required to change its regulatory strategy or to modify its applications for regulatory approval, which could delay and impair its ability to complete the pre-clinical and clinical development and manufacture of, and obtain regulatory approval for, its NoveCite product candidate. Changes in regulatory authorities and advisory groups, or any new requirements or guidelines they promulgate, may lengthen the regulatory review process, require NoveCite to perform additional studies, increase its development and manufacturing costs, lead to changes in regulatory pathways, positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of the NoveCite product candidate or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. As NoveCite advances its NoveCite product candidate, NoveCite will be required to consult with the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and its NoveCite product candidate will likely be reviewed by an FDA advisory committee. NoveCite also must comply with applicable requirements, and if it fails to do so, it may be required to delay or discontinue development of its NoveCite product candidate. Delays or unexpected costs in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, the regulatory approval necessary to bring the NoveCite product candidate to market could impair NoveCite\u2019s and our ability to generate sufficient product revenues to maintain our respective businesses.\nNoveCite has assumed that the biological capabilities of iPSCs and adult-donor derived cells are likely to be comparable. If it is discovered that this assumption is incorrect, the NoveCite product candidate research and development activities could be harmed.\nNoveCite anticipates that its research and development for its NoveCite product candidate will involve iPSCs, rather than adult-donor derived cells. With respect to iPSCs, NoveCite believes that scientists are still somewhat uncertain about the clinical utility, life span, and safety of such cells, and whether such cells differ in any clinically significant ways from adult-donor derived cells. If NoveCite discovers that iPSCs will not be useful for whatever reason for its NoveCite product candidate program, this would negatively affect NoveCite\u2019s ability to develop a marketable product and it and we may never become profitable, which would have an adverse effect on our respective businesses, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate, our ability to generate revenues from any resulting product will be subject to a variety of risks, many of which are out of our control.\nEven if one of our product candidates obtains regulatory approval, that product may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payers or the medical community. The indication may be limited to a subset of the population or we may implement a distribution system and patient access program that is limited. Coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates by third-party payers, including government payers, generally is also necessary for commercial success. We believe that the degree of market acceptance and our ability to generate revenues from any approved product candidate or acquired approved product will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u25cf results of any post-approval studies of the product;\n\u25cf potential or perceived advantages or disadvantages over alternative treatments;\n\u25cf availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payers;\n\u25cf the willingness of patients to pay out of pocket in the absence of government or third-party coverage;\n\u25cf the relative convenience and ease of administration and dosing schedule;\n\u25cf product labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf strength of sales, marketing and distribution support;\n\u25cf price of any future products, if approved, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf the effectiveness of our or any future collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies;\n\u25cf the effect of current and future healthcare laws on any approved products;\n\u25cf patient access programs that require patients to provide certain information prior to receiving new and refill prescriptions; and\n\u25cf requirements for prescribing physicians to complete certain educational programs for prescribing drugs.\nIf approved, any product candidate may fail to achieve market acceptance or generate significant revenue to achieve or sustain profitability. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payers on the benefits of any product candidate may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nEven if approved for marketing by applicable regulatory bodies, we will not be able to create a market for any of our product candidates if we fail to establish marketing, sales, and distribution capabilities, either on our own or through arrangements with third parties.\nOur strategy with our product candidates is to outsource to third parties all or most aspects of the product development process, and possibly marketing, sales, and distribution activities. Currently, we do not have any sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. In order to generate sales of any product candidate that receives regulatory approval, we must either acquire or develop an internal marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services for us. The acquisition or development of a sales and distribution infrastructure would require substantial resources, which may divert the attention of our management and key personnel and defer our product development efforts. To the extent that we enter into marketing and sales arrangements with other companies, our revenues will depend on the efforts of others. These efforts may not be successful. If we fail to develop sales, marketing, and distribution channels, or enter into arrangements for such with third parties, we will experience delays in product launch and sales and incur increased costs.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully against new entrants or established companies.\nCompetition in the pharmaceutical and medical products industries is intense and is characterized by costly and extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress. We are aware of several pharmaceutical companies also actively engaged in the development of therapies or products for at least some of the same conditions we are targeting. Many of these companies have substantially greater research and development capabilities as well as substantially greater marketing, financial and human resources than we do. In addition, many of these companies have significantly greater experience than us in undertaking pre-clinical testing, clinical trials and other regulatory approval procedures. Our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we are researching and developing. Such developments could render our product candidates, if approved, less competitive or possibly obsolete. We are also competing with respect to marketing capabilities and manufacturing efficiency, areas in which we have no current capabilities and in which we have no experience as a company, although our executive officers do have commercialization experience. However, that experience might not translate into the successful development and launch of any of our product candidates. Mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and similar events may also significantly increase the competition we face. In addition, new developments, including the development of other drug technologies and methods of preventing the incidence of disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries at a rapid pace. These developments may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. Compared to us, many of our potential competitors have substantially greater as well as access to strategic partners and capital resources.\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we can or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop products that are more effective, more useful and less costly than ours and may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products. In addition, our competitors may be more effective than us in commercializing their products and as a result, our business and prospects might be materially harmed.\nPhysicians and patients might not accept and use any of our product candidates for which regulatory approval is obtained.\nEven if the FDA approves one of our product candidates, physicians and patients might not accept and use it. Acceptance and use of our approved product candidates will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf perceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of any of our product candidates;\n\u25cf perceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the use of our product candidates versus the then respective standards of care for the disease or problem that we seek to address with our product candidates;\n\u25cf cost-effectiveness of our product candidates relative to competing products or therapies;\n\u25cf availability of reimbursement for our product candidates from government or other healthcare payers; and\n\u25cf effective marketing and distribution efforts by us and/or our licensees and distributors, if any.\nIf any of our current product candidates are approved, we expect their sales to generate substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future, and as a result, the failure of any of these product candidates to find market acceptance would harm our business and would require us to seek additional financing.\nOur ability to generate product revenues will be diminished if any of our product candidates that may be approved sell for inadequate prices or patients are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement.\nOur ability to commercialize our product candidates, alone or with collaborators, will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement will be available from:\n\u25cf government and health administration authorities;\n\u25cf private health maintenance organizations and health insurers; and\n\u25cf other healthcare payers.\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. Healthcare payers, including Medicare, are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Government and other healthcare payers increasingly attempt to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for drugs. Even if our product candidates are approved by the FDA, insurance coverage might not be available, and reimbursement levels might be inadequate, to cover our products. If government and other healthcare payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for our products, once approved, market acceptance of such products could be reduced. We cannot predict whether federal or state legislation will be passed that may impact reimbursement policies nor what the impact of any such legislation would be on the healthcare industry in general or on our business specifically.\nHealth administration authorities in countries other than the U.S. may not provide reimbursement for our products at rates sufficient for us to achieve profitability, or at all. Like the U.S., these countries have considered health care reform proposals and could materially alter their government-sponsored health care programs by reducing reimbursement rates. Any reduction in reimbursement rates under Medicare or foreign health care programs could negatively affect the pricing of our product candidates. If we are not able to charge a sufficient amount for our product candidates, then our margins and our profitability will be adversely affected.\nWe are and will be dependent on third-party contract research organizations to conduct all of our clinical trials.\nWe are and will be dependent on third-party research organizations to conduct all of our clinical trials with respect to our product candidates, including any candidates that we may develop in the future. If we are unable to obtain any necessary testing services on acceptable terms, we may not complete our product development efforts in a timely or cost-effective manner or at all. If we rely on third parties for human trials, we may lose some control over these activities and become too dependent upon these parties. These third parties may not complete testing activities on schedule or when we so request. We may not be able to secure and maintain suitable research organizations to conduct our human trials. We are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the trial\u2019s general plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, for conducting, recording, and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.\nWe rely exclusively on third parties to formulate and manufacture our product candidates.\nWe do not have and do not intend to establish our own manufacturing facilities. Consequently, we lack the physical plant to formulate and manufacture our product candidates, which are currently being manufactured entirely by commercial third-party manufacturers. If any product candidate we might develop or acquire in the future receives FDA approval, we will rely on one or more third-party contractors to manufacture our products. If, for any reason, we become unable to rely on our current source or any future source or sources to manufacture our product candidates, either for pre-clinical or clinical trials or for commercial quantities, then we would need to identify and contract with additional or replacement third-party manufacturers to manufacture compounds for preclinical, clinical, and commercial purposes. We might not be successful in identifying additional or replacement third-party manufacturers, or in negotiating acceptable terms with any that we do identify. If we are unable to secure and maintain third-party manufacturing capacity, the development and sales of our product candidates and our financial performance might be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, before any of our collaborators can begin to commercially manufacture our product candidates, each must obtain regulatory approval of the manufacturing facility and process. Manufacturing of drugs for clinical and commercial purposes must comply with the FDA\u2019s good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, and applicable non-U.S. regulatory requirements. The cGMP requirements govern quality control and documentation policies and procedures. Complying with cGMP and non-U.S. regulatory requirements will require that we expend time, money, and effort in production, recordkeeping, and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. Our contracted manufacturing facilities must also pass a pre-approval inspection prior to FDA approval. Failure to pass a pre-approval inspection might significantly delay FDA approval of our product candidates. If any of our collaborators fails to comply with these requirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action which could limit the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our product candidates. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations might be materially harmed.\nOur reliance on a limited number of third-party manufacturers exposes us to the following risks:\n\u25cf We might be unable to identify manufacturers for commercial supply on acceptable terms or at all because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the FDA must approve any replacement contractor. This approval would generally require compliance inspections. In addition, a new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our product candidates after receipt of FDA approval, if any;\n\u25cf Our third-party manufacturers might be unable to formulate and manufacture our product candidates in the volume and of the quality required to meet our clinical and commercial needs, if any;\n\u25cf Our contract manufacturers might not perform as agreed or might not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store and distribute our product candidates for commercialization;\n\u25cf Currently, the contract manufacturer for our clinical supplies is foreign, which increases the risk of shipping delays, adds the risk of import restrictions, and adds the risk of political and environmental uncertainties that might affect those countries;\n\u25cf Drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards;\n\u25cf If any third-party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our product candidates, we might not own, or might have to share, the intellectual property rights to the innovation with our licensors;\n\u25cf Operations of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers could be disrupted by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including a bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier or a natural disaster or a pandemic such as COVID-19; and\n\u25cf We might compete with other companies for access to these manufacturers\u2019 facilities and might be subject to manufacturing delays if the manufacturers give other clients higher priority than us.\nEach of these risks could delay our clinical trials or the approval, if any, of our product candidates by the FDA or any foreign regulatory agency or the commercialization of our product candidates and could result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations might be materially harmed.\nIf we materially breach or default under any of our license agreements, the licensor party to such agreement will have the right to terminate the license agreement, which termination may materially harm our business.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on the maintenance of our current and any future license agreements. Our license agreements impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty and other obligations on us. For example, under our current license agreements, we are required to use commercially reasonable diligence to develop and commercialize a product and to satisfy specified payment obligations. If we fail to comply with our obligations under our current license agreements or any future license agreements with any party, or we are subject to a bankruptcy, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to market products covered by the license. Each of our license agreements provides the licensor with a right to terminate the license agreement for our material breach or default under the agreement, including the failure to make any required milestone or other payments. Should the licensor under any of our license agreements exercise such a termination right, we would lose our right to the intellectual property under the respective license agreement, which loss may materially harm our business.\nAny termination, or breach by, or conflict with our strategic partners could harm our business.\nIf we or any of our current or future collaborators fail to renew or terminate any of our collaboration or license agreements or if either party fails to satisfy its obligations under any of our collaboration or license agreements or complete them in a timely manner, we could have difficulty completing the development of any of our product candidates and potentially lose significant sources of revenue, which could result in an adverse impact on our operations and financial condition as well as volatility in any future revenue. In addition, our agreements with our collaborators may have provisions that give rise to disputes regarding the rights and obligations of the parties. These and other possible disagreements could lead to termination of the agreement or delays in collaborative research, development, supply, or commercialization of our product candidates, or could require or result in litigation or arbitration. Any such conflicts with our collaborators could reduce our ability to obtain future collaboration agreements and could have a negative impact on our relationship with existing collaborators, adversely affecting our business and revenues. Finally, any of our collaborations may prove to be unsuccessful.\nWe rely on the significant experience and specialized expertise of our executive management and other key personnel and the loss of any of our executive management or key personnel or our inability to successfully hire their successors could harm our business.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the continued services and on the performance of our executive management and other key personnel, who have extensive experience and specialized expertise in our business. Our Chief Executive Officer, Leonard Mazur, our Vice Chairman, Myron Holubiak, and our Chief Medical Officer and Executive Vice President, Myron Czuczman, in particular have significant experience in the running of pharmaceutical companies and/or drug development itself. In addition, Matt Angel, a director of NoveCite, is serving as a technical consultant to that company and was instrumental in the discovery and development to date of NoveCite. This depth of experience is of significant benefit to us, especially given the small size of our management team and our company, including our subsidiaries. The loss of the services of any of Mr. Mazur, Mr. Holubiak, Dr. Czuczman or Dr. Angel, as well as any other member of our executive management or any key employees, including those at NoveCite, could harm our ability to attract capital and develop and commercialize our product candidates. Neither we nor NoveCite has key man life insurance policies.\nIf we are unable to retain or hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to grow our business might be harmed.\nWe utilize the services of a clinical management team on a part-time basis to assist us in managing our ongoing Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials and intend to do so for future preclinical and clinical trials. While we believe this will provide us with sufficient staffing for our current and future development efforts, we will need to hire or contract with additional qualified personnel with expertise in preclinical testing, clinical research and testing, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing and sales and marketing in connection with the continued development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates. We compete for qualified individuals with numerous pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, universities, and other research institutions.\nCompetition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot be certain that our search for such personnel will be successful. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success. In addition, we may be unable to attract and retain those qualified officers, directors and members of board committees required to provide for effective management. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, officers and directors, the management and operation of our business could be adversely affected.\nWe expect to need to increase the size of our organization to further develop our product candidates, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nWe will need to manage our anticipated growth and increased operational activity, including as a result of the in-licensing of I/ONTAK in September 2021 and the continuing development of I/ONTAK and our other product candidates. Our personnel, systems, and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. Our need to effectively execute our growth strategy will require that we:\n\u25cf manage our research and development activities and our regulatory trials effectively;\n\u25cf attract and motivate sufficient numbers of talented employees or consultants;\n\u25cf manage our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, licensees, contractors, collaborators and other third parties;\n\u25cf develop internal sales and marketing capabilities or establish collaborations with third parties with such capabilities;\n\u25cf commercialize our product candidates; and\n\u25cf improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.\nThis planned future growth could place a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure and may require our management to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, and give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and consultants and reduced productivity among remaining employees and consultants. We may not be able to make improvements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or increase our revenues could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth.\nWe plan to grow and develop our business through acquisitions of or investment in new or complementary businesses, products or technologies, and the failure to manage these acquisitions or investments, or the failure to integrate them with our existing business, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business strategy is based on the acquisition of additional product candidates. This is evidenced by our in-licensing of NoveCite in October 2020 and I/ONTAK in September 2021. We might consider opportunities to acquire or invest in other technologies, products and businesses that might enhance our capabilities or complement our current product candidates. Potential and completed acquisitions and strategic investments involve numerous risks, including potential problems or issues associated with the following:\n\u25cf assimilating the acquired technologies, products, or business operations;\n\u25cf maintaining uniform standards, procedures, controls, and policies;\n\u25cf unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition or investment;\n\u25cf diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our preexisting business;\n\u25cf maintaining or obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals or complying with regulatory standards; and\n\u25cf adverse effects on existing business operations.\nWe have no current commitments with respect to any acquisition or investment in other technologies or businesses. We do not know if we will identify other suitable acquisitions, whether we will be able to successfully complete any acquisitions, or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired product, technology or business into our business operations or retain key personnel, suppliers, or collaborators.\nOur ability to successfully develop our business through acquisitions including the recent in-licensing of I/ONTAK, will depend on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete, and integrate suitable target businesses or technologies and obtain any necessary financing. These efforts could be expensive and time consuming and might disrupt our ongoing operations. If we are unable to efficiently integrate any acquired business, technology or product into our business operations, our business and financial condition might be adversely affected.\nConflicts of interest may arise from our relationship with NoveCite.\nAs of November 30, 2022, we beneficially owned 75% of the voting power of NoveCite\u2019s outstanding common stock; Novellus owns the other 25%. As a result of our partial ownership, our relationship with NoveCite could give rise to certain conflicts of interest that could have an impact on our and NoveCite\u2019s respective research and development programs, business opportunities, and operations generally.\n\u25cf Even though we utilize different technologies than NoveCite, we could find ourselves in competition with it for research scientists, financing and other resources, licensing, manufacturing, and distribution arrangements.\n\u25cf NoveCite will engage for its own business in research and product development programs, investments, and business ventures, and we will not be entitled to participate or to receive an interest in those programs, investments, or business ventures other than to the extent as a stockholder in NoveCite. NoveCite will not be obligated to present any particular research and development, investment, or business opportunity to us, even if the opportunity would be within the scope of our research and development plans or programs, business objectives, or investment policies. These opportunities may include, for example, opportunities to acquire businesses or assets, including but not limited to patents and other intellectual property that could be used by us or by NoveCite.\n\u25cf Each conflict of interest will be resolved by our respective boards of directors in keeping with their fiduciary duties and such policies as they may implement from time to time.\n\u25cf There is overlap among our board of directors, senior management and research staffs and that of NoveCite. Two of our directors, Myron Holubiak and Leonard Mazur, also serve as directors of NoveCite. In addition, Myron Holubiak serves as Chief Executive Officer and Jaime Bartushak serves as Chief Financial Officer of both Citius and NoveCite. These overlapping positions could interfere with the duties owed by such individuals to Citius.\nRisks Related to Our Regulatory and Legal Environment\nWe might not obtain the necessary U.S. or foreign regulatory approvals to commercialize any product candidates.\nWe cannot assure you that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize for sale any product candidates we are currently developing or that we may acquire or seek to develop in the future. We will need FDA approval to commercialize our product candidates in the U.S. In order to obtain FDA approval of any product candidate, we must submit to the FDA an NDA or a BLA demonstrating that the product candidate is safe for humans and effective for its intended use. This demonstration requires significant research, pre-clinical studies, and clinical trials. Satisfaction of the FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements typically takes many years, depends upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate and requires substantial resources for research, development and testing. We cannot predict whether our research and clinical approaches will result in products that the FDA considers safe for humans and effective for their indicated uses. The FDA has substantial discretion in the product approval process and might require us to conduct additional pre-clinical and clinical testing, perform post-marketing studies or otherwise limit or impose conditions on any additional approvals we obtain. The approval process might also be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy that occur prior to or during our product candidate\u2019s regulatory review. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals might:\n\u25cf delay commercialization of, and our ability to derive product revenues from, our product candidates;\n\u25cf impose costly procedures on us; and\n\u25cf diminish any competitive advantages that we might otherwise enjoy.\nEven if we comply with all FDA requests, the FDA might ultimately reject one or more of our NDAs or BLAs. Even if we are able to obtain regulatory approval for a particular product candidate, the approval might limit the indicated medical uses for the product, limit our ability to promote, sell, and distribute the product, require that we conduct costly post-marketing surveillance, and/or require that we conduct ongoing post-marketing studies. We cannot be sure that we will ever obtain regulatory clearance for any of our product candidates. Failure to obtain FDA approval of one or more of our product candidates could severely undermine our business by leaving us without saleable products, and therefore without any potential sources of revenues, until another product candidate could be developed or obtained and successfully developed, approved and commercialized. Foreign jurisdictions impose similar regulatory approval processes and we will face the same risks if we seek foreign approval for any of our product candidates. There is no guarantee that we will ever be able to successfully develop or acquire any product candidate.\nFollowing any regulatory approval of any product candidate, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and restrictions, which may result in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize our other product candidates.\nIf one of our product candidates is approved by the FDA or by a foreign regulatory authority, we will be required to comply with extensive regulations for product manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, distribution, advertising, promotion and record keeping. Regulatory approvals may also be subject to significant limitations on the indicated uses or marketing of the products or to whom and how we may distribute an approved product. Even if U.S. regulatory approval is obtained, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies. For example, the label ultimately approved for any of our product candidates, if any, may include restrictions on use. If so, we may be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and restrictions, which may result in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize that product candidate. The FDA could also require a registry to track the patients utilizing the product or implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, that could restrict access to the product, which would reduce our revenues and/or increase our costs. Potentially costly post-marketing clinical studies may be required as a condition of approval to further substantiate safety or efficacy, or to investigate specific issues of interest to the regulatory authority. Similar risks apply in foreign jurisdictions.\nManufacturers of pharmaceutical products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Similar regulatory programs exist in foreign jurisdictions. Further, regulatory agencies must approve these manufacturing facilities before they can be used to manufacture our future approved products, if any, and these facilities are subject to ongoing regulatory inspections. In addition, regulatory agencies subject a pharmaceutical product, its manufacturer and the manufacturer\u2019s facilities to continual review and inspections. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, may result in restrictions on the marketing of that product, up to and including, withdrawal of the product from the market. If the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it could result in regulatory action and additional costs to us. Failure to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements may, either before or after product approval, if any, subject our company to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions.\nIn addition, the law or regulatory policies governing pharmaceutical products may change. New statutory requirements may be enacted or additional regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. Contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and their vendors or suppliers may also face changes in regulatory requirements from governmental agencies in the U.S. and other countries. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature, extent or effects of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or elsewhere. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we might not be permitted to market any future approved products and our business could suffer.\nWe could be forced to pay substantial damage awards if product liability claims that may be brought against us are successful.\nThe use of any of our product candidates in pre-clinical and clinical trials, and the sale of any approved products, may expose us to liability claims and financial losses resulting from the use or sale of our product candidates. We have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for our pre-clinical and clinical trials of $5.0 million per occurrence and in the aggregate, subject to a deductible of $25,000 per bodily injury and property damage occurrence, and a medical expense per person limit of $25,000. There can be no assurance that our existing insurance coverage will extend to any other product candidates in the future. Any product liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to satisfy all liabilities resulting from product liability claims. A successful claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially desirable terms, if at all. Even if a claim is not successful, defending such a claim would be time consuming and expensive, may damage that product\u2019s and our reputations in the marketplace, and would likely divert management\u2019s attention, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our Company.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur business depends on protecting our intellectual property.\nWithout the intellectual property rights we have already obtained, as well as the further rights we are also pursuing, our competitors would have opportunity to take advantage of our research and development efforts to develop competing products. Our success, competitive position, and future revenues, if any, depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors to obtain and maintain patent protection for our product candidates, methods, processes and other technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We anticipate filing additional patent applications both in the U.S. and in other countries, as appropriate. However, the patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our product candidates by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\u25cf Our patent rights might be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or otherwise might not provide any competitive advantage;\n\u25cf Our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do and many of which might make significant investments in competing technologies, might seek, or might already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our product candidates either in the U.S. or in international markets;\n\u25cf Countries other than the U.S. might have less restrictive patent laws than those upheld by U.S. courts, allowing foreign competitors the ability to exploit these laws to create, develop, and market competing products; and\n\u25cf As a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns, there might be significant pressure on the U.S. government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the U.S. for product candidates that prove successful.\nIn addition, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges. Thus, even if we or our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents might be substantially narrower than anticipated.\nBecause the time period from filing a patent application to the issuance, if ever, of the patent is often more than three years and because any regulatory approval and marketing for a pharmaceutical product often occurs several years after the related patent application is filed, the resulting market exclusivity afforded by any patent on our drug candidates and technologies will likely be substantially less than 20 years. For example, the U.S. patent on the original Mino-Lok composition expires in June 2024, and the U.S. patent on the stabilized Mino-Lok composition expires in November 2036. Since we anticipate significant additional time before FDA approval could be obtained, the maximum market exclusivity afforded by the statutory term of the currently issued patents would be less than 17 years. In the United States, the European Union and some other jurisdictions, patent term extensions are available for certain delays in either patent office proceedings or marketing and regulatory approval processes. However, due to the specific requirements for obtaining these extensions, there is no assurance that our patents will be granted extensions even if we encounter significant delays in patent office proceedings or marketing and regulatory approval.\nAdditionally, patent law is subject to change and varies among the U.S. and foreign countries. Depending on decisions by the United States Congress, the U.S. federal courts, the USPTO or similar authorities in foreign jurisdictions, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that may weaken our and our licensors\u2019 abilities to obtain new patents or to enforce existing patents that we and our licensors or partners may obtain in the future.\nPatent and other intellectual property protection is crucial to the success of our business and prospects, and there is a substantial risk that such protections will prove inadequate. Our business and prospects will be harmed if these protections prove insufficient.\nWe rely on trade secret protections through confidentiality agreements with our employees and other parties, and the breach of these agreements could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nWe rely on trade secrets, which we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, collaborators, suppliers, and other parties. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by our competitors. We might be involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of our proprietary rights. Any such litigation could result in substantial cost and divert management\u2019s attention from our operations.\nIf we infringe the rights of third parties we might have to forego developing and/or selling any approved products, pay damages, or defend against litigation.\nIf our product candidates, methods, processes, and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we might have to:\n\u25cf obtain licenses, which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u25cf abandon an infringing product candidate;\n\u25cf redesign our product candidates or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u25cf stop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others;\n\u25cf pay damages; and/or\n\u25cf defend litigation or administrative proceedings which might be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.\nAny of these events could substantially harm our earnings, financial condition, and operations.\nThe U.S. government could have \u201cmarch-in rights\u201d to certain of our intellectual property.\nIf at any time federal monies are used in support of the research and development activities at MDACC that resulted or in the future result in certain of our issued pending U.S. patent applications, the federal government retains what are referred to as \u201cmarch-in rights\u201d to patents that are granted on these applications. Our license agreements for Mino-Lok and Mino-Wrap each provide that in the event of such governmental funding, our rights are subject to the government\u2019s prior rights, if any. In addition, the license agreements provide that we will comply with the requirements of any agreement between MDACC and the governmental funding entity. If applicable, this could require us to grant the U.S. government either a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license to the patented invention in any field of use, upon terms that are reasonable for a particular situation. Circumstances that could trigger march-in rights generally would be set out in the agreement between MDACC and the funding governmental entity and could include, for example, failure to take, within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the invention in a field of use, failure to satisfy the health and safety needs of the public and failure to meet requirements of public use specified by federal regulations. A funding governmental entity could elect to exercise these march-in rights on their own initiative or at the request of a third party; however, the exercise of such march-in rights has been historically rare when the patent holder (or its licensee) is practicing the patent invention although there can be no assurance that such rights would not be exercised. This same risk would apply to any other license into which we enter if the licensor receives government funding for the product candidate that is the subject of the license.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nIf we fail to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq it could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market, and the continued listing of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market is subject to our compliance with a number of listing standards. These listing standards include the requirement for avoiding sustained losses, maintaining a minimum level of stockholders\u2019 equity, and maintaining a minimum stock price. The failure to meet any listing standard would subject us to potential loss of listing.\nIf our common stock were no longer listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, investors might only be able to trade on one of the over-the-counter markets, including the OTC Bulletin Board \u00ae or in the Pink Sheets \u00ae (a quotation medium operated by Pink Sheets LLC). This would impair the liquidity of our common stock not only in the number of shares that could be bought and sold at a given price, which might be depressed by the relative illiquidity, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and reduction in media coverage. In addition, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for us; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nWe have twice failed to meet the listing standards, between October 2019 and January 2020 and between April 2020 and July 2020, because the closing bid price for our common stock had fallen below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, as a result of which we did not comply with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Rule 5550(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules. Pursuant to Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A). In each instance, we regained compliance within the time period allowed by Nasdaq.\nIn the event of a future delisting, we would take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements.\nIf our common stock were delisted and determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock in the secondary market.\nIf our common stock were removed from listing with The Nasdaq Capital Market, it may be subject to the so-called \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange, which is the exception on which we currently rely. For any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d unless exempt, the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. If our common stock were delisted and determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock on the secondary market.\nYou may experience dilution of your ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock.\nFor the foreseeable future, to finance our operations, including possible acquisitions or strategic transactions, we expect to issue equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. We are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of 400,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of September 30, 2022, there were 146,211,130 shares of common stock outstanding, 38,325,489 shares underlying warrants with a weighted average exercise price of $1.57 per share and 9,400,171 shares underlying options with a weighted average exercise price of $2.07 per share. We may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional shares of common stock or common stock equivalents may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock or publicly traded warrants.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation allows for our Board of Directors to create new series of preferred stock without further approval by our stockholders, which could adversely affect the rights of the holders of the common stock.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of any such preferred stock without further stockholder approval. As a result, our Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of one or more series of preferred stock that would grant preferential rights to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the preferred shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of the common stock. In addition, our Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than the common stock or that is convertible into our common stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of the common stock or result in dilution to our existing stockholders.", "PERMNO": 16857, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "CTXR"}
