{"cik": "1751692", "company": "1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nThe recent global coronavirus outbreak may pose risks and could harm business and results of operations of the Company.\nIn December 2019, a coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) was reported in China, and, in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic. Since first being reported in China, the coronavirus has spread to additional countries including the United States. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on businesses of the Company, and there is no guarantee that efforts by the Company to address the adverse impacts of the coronavirus will be effective. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and actions taken to contain the coronavirus or its impact, among others.\nThe ultimate risk posed by coronavirus remains highly uncertain; however, reports as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus suggest that COVID-19 spreads more quickly and has a higher mortality rate than flu-like epidemics of the recent past. COVID-19 therefore poses a material risk to the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company and potentially could create risks for the Company, including:\n\u2022 risks to the capital markets that may impact the performance of our investment securities portfolio;\n\u2022 effects on key employees, including operational management personnel and those charged with preparing, monitoring and evaluating the companies\u2019 financial reporting and internal controls;\n\u2022 declines in demand for loans and other banking services and products, as well as a decline in the credit quality of our loan portfolio, owing to the effects of COVID-19 in the markets served by the Company;\n\u2022 declines in demand resulting from adverse impacts of the disease on businesses deemed to be \u201cnon-essential\u201d by governments in the markets served by the Company; and\n\u2022 increasing or protracted volatility in the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThese factors, together or in combination with other events or occurrences not yet known or anticipated, could adversely affect the value of the Company. If the Company is unable to recover from a business disruption on a timely basis, the Company's business and financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected. The Company may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions, which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a substantial amount of commercial real estate and commercial loans, and intend to continue to increase originations of these types of loans. These loans involve credit risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2019, commercial real estate loans (which includes non-owner occupied commercial real estate, multi-family, owner occupied commercial real estate and one- to four-family non-owner occupied loans) totaled $180.5 million, or 57.8% of our loan portfolio, and commercial loans (which includes commercial and industrial loans) totaled $34.1 million, or 10.9% of our loan portfolio. Of this aggregate amount, we had $69.4 million in non-owner\noccupied non-residential real estate, $59.4 million in multi-family residential real estate, $39.5 million in owner occupied non-residential real estate, $9.7 million in non-owner occupied residential real estate, $904,000 in commercial real estate construction loans, and $1.6 million in commercial land development loans. We intend to increase originations of these types of loans.\nGiven their larger balances and the complexity of the underlying collateral, commercial real estate and commercial loans generally have more risk than the one- to four-family residential real estate loans we originate. Because the repayment of commercial real estate and commercial loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower\u2019s properties or related businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the local, regional and national real estate market or economy. A downturn in the real estate market or the local, regional and national economy could adversely impact the value of properties securing the loan or the revenues from the borrower\u2019s business, thereby increasing the risk of non-performing loans. Further, unlike residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans and commercial loans may be secured by collateral other than real estate, such as inventory and accounts receivable, the value of which may depreciate over time, may be more difficult to appraise or liquidate and may be more susceptible to fluctuation in value at default. In addition, the physical condition of non-owner occupied properties may be below that of owner occupied properties due to lax property maintenance standards, which have a negative impact on the value of the collateral properties. As our commercial real estate and commercial loan portfolios increase, the corresponding risks and potential for losses from these loans may also increase.\nOur portfolio of loans with a higher risk of loss is increasing, which may lead to additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs, which would reduce our profits or cause losses.\nOur commercial real estate loan portfolio has decreased to $180.5 million, or 57.8% of total loans, at December 31, 2019 from $193.8 million, or 52.0% of total loans, at December 31, 2018. We intend to continue our emphasis on originating commercial real estate and commercial loan originations. Many of these loans have not been subjected to unfavorable economic conditions. As a result, it is difficult to predict the future performance of this part of our loan portfolio. These loans may have delinquency or charge-off levels above our historical experience, which could adversely affect our future performance.\nThe level of our commercial real estate loan portfolio may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny.\nThe FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have promulgated joint guidance on sound risk management practices for financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Under this guidance, a financial institution that, like us, is actively involved in commercial real estate lending should perform a risk assessment to identify concentrations. A financial institution may have a concentration in commercial real estate lending if, among other factors (i) total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of total capital, or (ii) total reported loans secured by multi-family and non-farm non-residential properties, loans for construction, land development and other land, and loans otherwise sensitive to the general commercial real estate market, including loans to commercial real estate related entities, represent 300% or more of total capital. The particular focus of the guidance is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be at greater risk to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance states that management should employ heightened risk management practices including board and management oversight and strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing. We have concluded that we have a concentration in commercial real estate lending under the foregoing standards because our balance in commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2019 represents more than 300% of total capital. Owner occupied commercial real estate totals 67.4% of total capital, while non-owner occupied commercial real estate totals an additional 118.2% of total capital. While we believe we have implemented policies and procedures with respect to our commercial real estate loan portfolio consistent with this guidance, bank regulators could require us to implement additional policies and procedures consistent with their interpretation of the guidance that may result in additional costs to us.\nOur business strategy includes managed growth, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively. Growing our operations could also cause our expenses to increase faster than our revenues.\nOur business strategy includes growth in loans and deposits. Achieving such growth will require us to attract customers that currently bank at other financial institutions in our market area. Our ability to successfully grow will depend on a variety of factors, including the ability of our executive officers to execute our business strategy to increase commercial real estate and commercial loans and to increase our new and existing customers\u2019 deposit relationships, our ability to attract and retain experienced bankers, the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, competition from other financial institutions in our market area and our ability to manage our growth. Growth opportunities may not be available or we may not be able to manage our growth successfully. If we do not manage our growth effectively, our financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. Furthermore, there can be considerable costs involved in expanding lending capacity, and generally a period of time is required to generate the necessary revenues to offset these costs, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence. Accordingly, any such business expansion can be expected to negatively impact our earnings until certain economies of scale are reached.\nOur utilization of time deposits, including brokered certificates of deposit, as a source of funds for loans and our other liquidity needs could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe rely primarily on deposits for funds to make loans and provide for our other liquidity needs, including time deposits and brokered certificates of deposit. As of December 31, 2019, brokered deposits, represented approximately 8.6% of our total deposits. Such deposits may not be as stable as other types of deposits and, in the future, depositors may not renew those time deposits when they mature, or we may have to pay a higher rate of interest to attract or keep them or to replace them with other deposits or with funds from other sources. Not being able to attract those deposits or to keep or replace them as they mature would adversely affect our liquidity. Additionally, we are regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which requires us to maintain certain capital levels to be considered \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d If we fail to maintain these capital levels, we could lose our ability to obtain funding through brokered deposits. In addition, we may also be restricted from paying higher deposit rates to attract, keep or replace those deposits, which could have a negative effect on our operating results and the value of our common stock.\nOur cost of operations is high relative to our revenues.\nThe cost of generating our income is measured by our efficiency ratio (the ratio of non-interest expense to the sum of net interest income and non-interest income). Our efficiency ratio was 97.3%, 101.7% and 112.2% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our efficiency ratio lags our peer group as our competitors for loans and deposits are often larger banks who can offer very competitive terms to originate and retain commercial real estate and commercial loans, as well as very competitive rates on deposit products. Additionally, our interest expense is higher than our peer group as our sources of funding tend to rely on higher-cost brokered certificates of deposit and Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d) advances more than our competitors. We have also had a series of significant one-time expenses over the last several years, including core data processing conversion, branch sale costs and expenses related to our self-insured healthcare coverage.\nWe face additional risks due to our mortgage banking activities that could negatively impact net income and liquidity.\nWe sell the majority of the fixed-rate conforming and eligible jumbo one-to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate. The sale of these loans generates noninterest income and are a source of liquidity for the Company. Disruption in the secondary market for residential mortgage loans could result in our inability to sell mortgage loans, which could negatively impact our liquidity position and earnings. In addition, declines in real estate values or increases in interest rates could reduce the potential for robust mortgage originations, which could negatively impact our earnings. As we do sell mortgage loans, we also face the risk that such loans may have been made in breach of our representations and warranties to the buyers and we could be forced to repurchase such loans or pay other damages.\nWe depend on our management team to implement our business strategy and execute successful operations and we could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nWe are dependent upon the services of the members of our senior management team who direct our strategy and operations. Our executive officers and lending personnel possess expertise in our markets and key business relationships, and have been integral in the restructuring of our operations, including the implementation of a more aggressive sales culture within our institution. Any one of them could be difficult to replace. Our loss of these persons, or our inability to hire additional qualified personnel, could impact our ability to implement our business strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to compete in our markets. See \u201cManagement.\u201d\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is established through a provision for loan losses, that represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable losses within the existing portfolio of loans. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, we rely on our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio and adjustment may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. Consequently, a problem with one or more loans could require us to significantly increase the level of our provision for loan losses. In addition, federal regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and as a result of such reviews, we may decide to adjust our allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in the process of establishing the allowance for loan losses, as the process is our responsibility and any adjustment of the allowance is the responsibility of management. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease our net income.\nWe may be adversely affected by recent changes in U.S. tax laws.\nChanges in tax laws contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017, include a number of provisions that will have an impact on the banking industry, borrowers and the market for single-family residential real estate. Changes include (i) a lower limit on the deductibility of mortgage interest on single-family residential mortgage loans, (ii) the elimination of interest deductions for home equity loans, (iii) a limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense and (iv) a limitation on the deductibility of property taxes and state and local income taxes. The recent changes in the tax laws may have an adverse effect on the market for, and valuation of, residential properties, and on the demand for such loans in the future, and could make it harder for borrowers to make their loan payments. If home ownership becomes less attractive, demand for mortgage loans could decrease. The value of the properties securing loans in our loan portfolio may be adversely impacted as a result of the changing economics of home ownership, which could require an increase in our provision for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA worsening of economic conditions in our market area could reduce demand for our products and services and/or result in increases in our level of non-performing loans, which could adversely affect our operations, financial condition and earnings.\nLocal economic conditions have a significant impact on the ability of our borrowers to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing loans. A deterioration in economic conditions could have the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations:\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and services may decline;\n\u2022\nloan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\ncollateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, thereby reducing customers\u2019 future borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans; and\n\u2022\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us.\nMoreover, a significant decline in general local, regional or national economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, pandemic, acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, unemployment or\nother factors beyond our control could further impact these local economic conditions, disrupt our business and negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nAdditionally, the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, such as the potential spread of coronavirus, could lead to quarantines, business shutdowns, increases in unemployment, labor shortages, disruptions to supply chains, and overall economic instability. Events such as these may become more common in the future and could cause significant damage such as disrupt power and communication services, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing the repayment of our loans, which could result in the loss of revenue. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nOur size makes it more difficult for us to compete.\nOur asset size makes it more difficult to compete with other financial institutions that are larger and can more easily afford to invest in the marketing and technologies needed to attract and retain customers. Because our principal source of income is the net interest income we earn on our loans and investments after deducting interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds, our ability to generate the revenues needed to cover our expenses and finance such investments is limited by the size of our loan and investment portfolios. Accordingly, we are not always able to offer new products and services as quickly as our competitors. Our lower earnings may also make it more difficult to offer competitive salaries and benefits. In addition, our smaller customer base may make it difficult to generate meaningful non-interest income from such activities as securities brokerage. Finally, as a smaller institution, we are disproportionately affected by the continually increasing costs of compliance with new banking and other regulations.\nWe face significant operational risks because the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions and because of our reliance on technology.\nOur business requires us to collect, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding our customers, employees and our own business, operations, plans and business strategies. Our operational and security systems infrastructure, including our computer systems, data management and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our performance. Our operational risks include the risk of malfeasance by employees or persons outside our company, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, systems failures or interruptions, breaches of our internal control systems and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of operational deficiencies or as a result of non-compliance with applicable regulatory standards or customer attrition due to potential negative publicity.\nIn the event of a breakdown in our internal control systems, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, or a breach of our security systems, including if confidential or proprietary information were to be mishandled, misused or lost, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, civil litigation and/or suffer damage to our reputation. Although to date we have not experienced any technology failures, cyber-attacks or other information or security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or other consequences in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats and our role as a provider of financial services, our continuous transmission of sensitive information to, and storage of such information by, third parties, including our vendors and regulators, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, threats of cyber terrorism, and system and customer account updates and conversions. As a result, cyber-security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority.\nOur information technology systems may be subject to failure, interruption or security breaches.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities investments, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions and security breaches, including privacy\nbreaches and cyber-attacks, and, although we have not experienced any such events to date, such failures, interruptions or breaches may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur.\nThere have been increasing efforts by third parties to breach data security at financial institutions. Such attacks include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or information or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information, damages to systems, or other material disruptions to network access or business operations. There have been several recent instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data. Although we take protective measures, the security of our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code and cyber-attacks that could have an impact on information security. Because the techniques used to cause security breaches change frequently, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nIn addition, we outsource a majority of our data processing requirements to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with those service providers, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel. To our knowledge, the services and programs provided to us by third parties have not suffered any security breaches. However, the existence of cyber-attacks or security breaches at third parties with access to our data, such as vendors, may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner.\nThe occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture changes in interest rates could reduce our profits and asset values.\nNet income is the amount by which net interest income and non-interest income exceed non-interest expense and the provision for loan losses. Net interest income makes up a majority of our net income and is based on the difference between:\n\u2022\nthe interest income we earn on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities; and\n\u2022\nthe interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nThe rates we earn on our assets and the rates we pay on our liabilities are generally fixed for a contractual period of time. Like many savings institutions, our liabilities generally have shorter contractual maturities than our assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility because market interest rates change over time. In a period of rising interest rates, the interest income we earn on our assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest we pay on our liabilities. In a period of declining interest rates, the interest income we earn on our assets may decrease more rapidly than the interest we pay on our liabilities, as borrowers prepay mortgage loans, and mortgage-backed securities and callable investment securities are called, requiring us to reinvest those cash flows at lower interest rates.\nIn addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. A decline in interest rates results in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities as borrowers refinance their debt to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities. Furthermore, an inverted interest rate yield curve, where short-term interest rates (which are usually the rates at which financial institutions borrow funds) are higher than long-term interest rates (which are usually the rates at which financial institutions lend funds for fixed-rate loans) can reduce a financial institution\u2019s net interest margin and create financial risk for financial institutions that originate longer-term, fixed-rate mortgage loans. At December 31, 2019, 70.2% of our loan portfolio consisted of fixed-rate loans.\nAny substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect the value of our assets and ultimately affect our earnings.\nWe monitor interest rate risk through the use of simulation models, including estimates of the amounts by which the fair value of our assets, liabilities and equity (our economic value of equity or \u201cEVE\u201d) would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we estimate that we would experience an 11.3% decrease in EVE. For further discussion of how changes in interest rates could impact us, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc.-Management of Market Risk.\u201d\nStrong competition within our market areas may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and securities brokerage firms and unregulated or less regulated non-banking entities, operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and higher lending limits than we have and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, some of our competitors offer loans with lower interest rates and fees on more attractive terms than loans we offer. Competition also makes it increasingly difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. If we must raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans due to competition, our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected.\nThe financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of new legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. For additional information see \u201cBusiness of 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc.-Market Area\u201d and \u201c-Competition.\u201d\nChanges in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and/or increase our costs of operations.\nPyraMax Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc. is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the federal deposit insurance fund and the depositors of PyraMax Bank, rather than for our stockholders. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. These regulations, along with existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance and monetary laws, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations, control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. Further, changes in accounting standards can be both difficult to predict and involve judgment and discretion in their interpretation by us and our independent accounting firm. These changes could materially impact, potentially even retroactively, how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions.\nThe USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are suspected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on pursuing acquisitions or establishing new branches. The policies and procedures we have adopted that are designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations. Furthermore, these rules and regulations continue to evolve and expand.\nWe are subject to stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, require us to raise additional capital, or limit our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares.\nFederal regulations establish minimum capital requirements for insured depository institutions, including minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, and defines \u201ccapital\u201d for calculating these ratios. The minimum capital requirements are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The regulations also establish a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5%, and, when fully phased in, will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the then applicable buffer amount.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, and result in regulatory actions if we are unable to comply with such requirements. Specifically, PyraMax Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to the Company will be limited if it does not have the capital conservation buffer required by the capital rules, which may further limit the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends to stockholders. See \u201cRegulation and Supervision-Federal Banking Regulation-Capital Requirements.\u201d\nThe cost of additional finance and accounting systems, procedures, compliance and controls in order to satisfy public company reporting requirements will increase our expenses.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company, including the substantial public reporting obligations, will require significant expenditures and place additional demands on our management team. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a stand-alone public company. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes Oxley Act\u201d) requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, starting with the second annual report that we would expect to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. In addition, we may need to hire additional compliance, accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical knowledge, and we may not be able to do so in a timely fashion. As a result, we may need to rely on outside consultants to provide these services for us until qualified personnel are hired. These obligations will increase our operating expenses and could divert our management\u2019s attention from our operations.\nChanges in accounting standards could affect reported earnings.\nThe bodies responsible for establishing accounting standards, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of our financial statements. In some cases, we could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in management\u2019s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and our financial condition or operating results.\nIn preparing periodic reports we are required to file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including our consolidated financial statements, our management is and will be required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on management\u2019s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and our determinations with respect to amounts owed for income taxes.\nLegal and regulatory proceedings and related matters could adversely affect us.\nWe have been and may in the future become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings. We consider most of the proceedings to be in the normal course of our business or typical for the industry; however, it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and we may not prevail in any proceedings or litigation. There could be substantial costs and management diversion in such litigation and proceedings, and any adverse determination could have a materially adverse effect on our business, brand or image, or our financial condition and results of our operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities or properties we own.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and we could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to one or more of these properties, or with respect to properties that we own in operating our business. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing defaulted loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous conditions or toxic substances are found on these properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, civil fines and criminal penalties regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected any particular property. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Our policies, which require us to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on non-residential real property, may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nWe are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in our market area and contiguous areas. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nThere may be a limited trading market in our common stock, which would hinder your ability to sell our common stock and may lower the market price of the stock.\nOur common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cBCOW\u201d. The development of an active trading market depends on the existence of willing buyers and sellers, the presence of which is not within our control, or that of any market maker. The number of active buyers and sellers of the shares of common stock at any particular time may be limited. Under such circumstances, you could have difficulty selling your shares of common stock\non short notice, and, therefore, you should not view the shares of common stock as a short-term investment. In addition, our public \u201cfloat,\u201d which is the total number of our outstanding shares less the shares held by 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC, our employee stock ownership plan and our directors and executive officers, is likely to be quite limited. As a result, it is unlikely that an active trading market for the common stock will develop or that, if it develops, it will continue.\nOur stock-based benefit plans will increase our costs, which will reduce our net income.\nOur employee stock ownership plan purchased 175,528 shares of common stock in the stock offering. We will record annual employee stock ownership plan expenses in an amount equal to the fair value of shares of common stock committed to be released to employees. If shares of common stock appreciate in value over time, compensation expense relating to the employee stock ownership plan will increase.\nWe also adopted a stock-based benefit plan, under which participants may be awarded shares of restricted common stock (at no cost to them) and/or options to purchase shares of our common stock. Under federal regulations, we are authorized to grant awards of stock or options under a stock-based benefit plan in an amount up to 25% of the shares of common stock held by persons other than 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC. The number of shares of common stock or options granted under any initial stock-based benefit plan may not exceed 1.96% and 4.90%, respectively, of our total outstanding shares, including shares issued to 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC and contributed to the charitable foundation. The shares of restricted common stock granted under the stock-based benefit plan will be expensed by us over their vesting period based on the fair market value of the shares on the date they are awarded and may lead to a reduction to stockholders\u2019 equity. We will generally recognize as an expense in our income statement the grant-date fair value of stock options as such options vest. When we record an expense related to the grant of options using the fair value method, we will incur significant compensation and benefits expense.\nThe implementation of a stock-based benefit plan may dilute your ownership interest.\nWe adopted a stock-based benefit plan, following shareholder approval that will be funded through either open market purchases, if permitted, or from the issuance of authorized but unissued shares. Public stockholders would experience a reduction in ownership interest totaling 6.31% in the event newly issued shares are used to fund stock options and restricted stock awards in an amount equal to 4.90% and 1.96%, respectively, of the total shares issued in the mutual holding company reorganization and stock offering (including shares issued to 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC and the charitable foundation).\nOur contribution to the charitable foundation may not be tax deductible, which could reduce our profits.\nWe may not have sufficient profits to be able to fully use the tax deduction from our contribution to the charitable foundation. Under the Internal Revenue Code, an entity is permitted to deduct up to 10% of its taxable income (generally income before federal income taxes and charitable contributions expense) in any one year for charitable contributions. Any contribution in excess of the 10% limit may be deducted for federal income tax purposes over each of the five years following the year in which the charitable contribution is made. Accordingly, a charitable contribution could, if necessary, be deducted over a six-year period and expires thereafter.", "PERMNO": 18356, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "BCOW"}
