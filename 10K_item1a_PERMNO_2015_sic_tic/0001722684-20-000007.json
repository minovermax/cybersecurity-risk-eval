{"cik": "1722684", "company": "WYNDHAM HOTELS & RESORTS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information set forth in this report. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting our Company. However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nIf any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nThe lodging industry is highly competitive, and we are subject to risks related to competition that may adversely affect our performance and growth.\nOur continued success depends upon our ability to compete effectively in markets that contain numerous competitors, some of whom may have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. We compete with other hotel franchisors for franchisees and we may not be able to grow our franchise system. New hotels may be constructed and these additions to supply create new competitors, in some cases without corresponding increases in demand for lodging. Competition may reduce fee structures, potentially causing us to lower our fees, and may require us to offer terms to prospective franchisees less favorable to us than current franchise agreements, which may adversely impact our profits. Our franchisees also compete with alternative lodging channels, including third-party providers of short-term rental properties and serviced apartments. Increasing use of these alternative lodging channels could adversely affect the occupancy and/or average rates at franchised hotels and our revenues. The use of business models by competitors that are different from ours may require us to change our model so that we can remain competitive.\nWe are subject to business, financial, operating and other risks common to the hotel, hotel franchising and hotel management industries which also affect our franchisees and hotel owners, any of which could reduce our revenues, limit our growth or otherwise impact our business.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from fees based on room revenues at hotels franchised under our brands. As such, our business is subject, directly or through our franchisees, to risks common in the hotel, hotel franchising and hotel management industries, including risks related to:\n\u2022\nour ability to meet our objectives for growth in the number of our franchised hotels, hotel rooms in our franchise system and hotels under management and to retain and renew franchisee and hotel management contracts, all on favorable terms;\n\u2022\nthe number, occupancy and room rates of hotels operating under our franchise and management agreements;\n\u2022\nthe delay of hotel openings in our pipeline;\n\u2022\nchanges in the supply and demand for hotel rooms;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and maintain positive relations and contractual arrangements with current and potential franchisees and hotel owners under our hotel management agreements and other third parties, including marketing alliances and affiliations with e-commerce channels;\n\u2022\nour franchisees\u2019 pricing decisions;\n\u2022\nthe quality of the services provided by franchisees and their investment in the maintenance and improvement of properties;\n\u2022\nthe bankruptcy or insolvency of a significant number of our franchised or managed hotels;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition of franchisees, owners or other developers and the availability of financing to them;\n\u2022\nadverse events occurring at franchised or managed hotel locations, including personal injuries, food tampering, contamination or the spread of illness, including the 2019 Novel Coronavirus;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity, which could damage our hotel brands;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully market our current or any future hotel brands and programs, including our rewards program, and to service or pilot new initiatives;\n\u2022\nour management contract or relationship with CorePoint Lodging, Inc. (\u201cCorePoint\u201d), which in aggregate owns approximately 69% of our managed hotels and any decision by CorePoint to divest additional hotels;\n\u2022\nchanges in the laws, regulations and legislation affecting our business, internationally and domestically;\n\u2022\nour failure to adequately protect and maintain our trademarks and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe relative mix of branded hotels in the various hotel industry price categories;\n\u2022\ncorporate budgets and spending and cancellations, deferrals or renegotiations of group business;\n\u2022\nseasonal or cyclical volatility in our business;\n\u2022\noperating costs, including as a result of inflation, energy costs and labor costs, such as minimum wage increases and unionization, workers\u2019 compensation and health-care related costs and insurance; and\n\u2022\ndisputes, claims and litigation and other legal proceedings concerning our or our franchised or managed hotels\u2019 operations regarding human trafficking or other matters, including with consumers, government regulators, other businesses, franchisees and hotel owners, organized labor activities and class actions.\nAny of these factors could reduce our revenues, increase our costs or otherwise limit our opportunities for growth.\nDeclines in or disruptions to the travel industry may adversely affect us.\nWe face risks affecting the travel and hotel industries that include: economic slowdown and recession; economic factors such as increased costs of living and reduced discretionary income adversely impacting decisions by consumers and businesses to use travel accommodations; terrorist incidents and threats and associated heightened travel security measures; political and regional strife; acts of God such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, volcanoes and other natural disasters; war; concerns with or threats of pandemics, contagious diseases or health epidemics, such as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus; environmental disasters; lengthy power outages; increased pricing, financial instability and capacity constraints of air carriers; airline job actions and strikes; and increases in gasoline and other fuel prices. Any such decline in or disruptions to the travel or hotel industries may adversely affect our franchised hotels, the operations of current and potential franchisees, developers and hotel owners with which we have hotel management contracts.\nThird-party Internet travel intermediaries and peer-to-peer online networks.\nConsumers increasingly use third-party Internet travel intermediaries, including search engines, and peer-to-peer online networks to search for and book their lodging accommodations. As the percentage of internet reservations increases, travel intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions and reduced room rates to the detriment of our business. Additionally, such travel intermediaries may divert reservations away from our direct online channels or increase the overall cost of Internet reservations for our affiliated hotels through their fees and a variety of online marketing methods, including the purchase by certain travel intermediaries of keywords consisting of or containing our hotel brands from Internet search engines to influence search results and direct guests to their websites. If we fail to reach satisfactory agreements with intermediaries, our affiliated hotels may not appear on their websites and we could lose business as a result.\nOur revenues could be impacted if we are unable to maintain our contractual relationships with CorePoint.\nIn connection with the La Quinta acquisition, we entered into hotel-management agreements and hotel franchise agreements with CorePoint. We are also subject to certain agreements related to CorePoint\u2019s previously completed spin-off of its real estate business. In October 2019, we entered into an additional agreement with CorePoint to collaborate on a number of new technology and operating initiatives, support CorePoint\u2019s efforts to enhance its portfolio and resolve open issues between CorePoint and us; our obligations under our amended hotel-management agreements include, among other things, the obligation to develop and launch enhanced automated revenue management, sales and reservations technology by\nspecified dates and timely deliver a satisfactory annual System and Organization Control Report (SOC-1) commencing in 2021 for the calendar year 2020. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with CorePoint, if we are unable to perform our obligations to CorePoint under our agreements and CorePoint terminates these agreements, if CorePoint is unable to perform its obligations to us under our agreements and we terminate these agreements, or CorePoint or we do not renew these agreements following their expiration, our profitability and revenues could decrease and our growth potential may be adversely affected.\nOur license and other revenues from former Parent could be impacted by any softness in Wyndham Destinations\u2019 sales of vacation ownership interests or decline in the volume of affinity leads which we generate for Wyndham Destinations.\nIn connection with the spin-off, we entered into a number of agreements with Wyndham Destinations that govern our ongoing relationship with Wyndham Destinations. Our success depends, in part, on the maintenance of our ongoing relationship with Wyndham Destinations, Wyndham Destinations\u2019 performance of its obligations under these agreements, including Wyndham Destinations\u2019 maintenance of the quality of products and services it sells under the \u201cWyndham\u201d trademark and certain other trademarks and intellectual property that we license to Wyndham Destinations. Under the license, development and noncompetition agreement, Wyndham Destinations pays us significant royalties and other fees based on the volume of Wyndham Destinations\u2019 sales of vacation ownership interests and other vacation products and services. If Wyndham Destinations is unable to compete effectively for sales of vacation ownership interests, our royalty fees under such agreement could be adversely impacted. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with Wyndham Destinations, or if Wyndham Destinations does not perform its obligations under these agreements, fails to maintain the quality of the products and services it sells under the \u201cWyndham\u201d trademark and certain other trademarks or fails to pay such royalties, our earnings could decrease.\nOur international operations are subject to additional risks not generally applicable to our domestic operations.\nOur international operations are subject to numerous risks including: exposure to local economic conditions; potential adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States; hostility from local populations; political instability, including potential disruptions from the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, trade disputes with trade partners, including China and other geopolitical risks; threats or acts of terrorism; the effect of disruptions caused by severe weather, natural disasters, outbreak of disease, such as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus or other events that make travel to a particular region less attractive or more difficult; the presence and acceptance of varying levels of business corruption in international markets; restrictions and taxes on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings; government policies against businesses or properties owned by foreigners; investment restrictions or requirements; diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights in foreign countries; forced nationalization of hotel properties by local, state or national governments; foreign exchange restrictions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; conflicts between local laws and U.S. laws, including laws that impact our rights to protect our intellectual property; withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries; and changes in and application of foreign taxation structures including value added taxes. Any adverse outcome resulting from the financial instability or performance of foreign economies, the instability of other currencies and the related volatility on foreign exchange and interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nChanges in U.S. federal, state and local or foreign tax law, interpretations of existing tax law or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation at the federal, state and local levels in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rate and cash flows could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax, and our ability to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, U.S. federal, state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. We are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in U.S. federal and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. An unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs, penalties and interest, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, we are directly and indirectly affected by new tax legislation and regulation and the interpretation of tax laws and regulations worldwide. Changes in such legislation, regulation or interpretation could increase our taxes and have an\nadverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. This includes potential changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws arising out of the Base Erosion Profit Shifting project initiated by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.\nWe are subject to risks related to our debt, hedging transactions, our extension of credit and the cost and availability of capital.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had aggregate outstanding debt of $2,122 million. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which may intensify the risks related to our debt. Our debt instruments contain restrictions, covenants and events of default that, among other things, could limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions; take advantage of business opportunities; incur or guarantee additional debt; pay dividends or make distributions; make investments or acquisitions; sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of certain assets; create liens; consolidate or merge; enter into transactions with affiliates; and prepay and repurchase or redeem certain indebtedness. Failure to meet our payment obligations or comply with other financial covenants could result in a default and acceleration of the underlying debt and under other debt instruments that contain cross-default provisions.\nIn order to reduce or hedge our financial exposure to the effects of currency and interest rate fluctuations, we may use financial instruments. As a result, changes in interest rates may adversely affect our financing costs and/or change the market value of our hedging instruments. Any failure or non-performance of counterparties to foreign exchange and interest rate hedging transactions could result in losses.\nOur credit facility gives us the option to use the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a base rate and our interest rate swaps are based on the one-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rate. The Federal Reserve has established the Alternative Reference Rates Committee to identify alternative reference rates in the event that LIBOR ceases to exist after 2021. Our credit facility allows us and the administrative agent to replace LIBOR with an alternative benchmark rate, subject to the rejection of the majority of the lenders as set forth in the credit facility. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association is expected to issue protocols to allow swap parties to amend their existing contracts. Any such discontinuation of LIBOR or the use of an alternative benchmark rate could cause our costs to increase.\nIn addition, we extend credit to assist franchisees and hotel owners in converting to or building a new hotel under one of our hotel brands through development advance notes and mezzanine or other forms of subordinated financing. The inability of franchisees and hotel owners to pay back such loans could materially and adversely affect our cash flows and business.\nWe may need to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flows to the payment of principal and interest. Our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, or general corporate or other purposes may be limited, and we may be unable to renew or refinance our debt on terms as favorable as our existing debt or at all. Additionally, certain market liquidity factors, including uncertainty or volatility in the equity and credit markets, outside of our control could affect our access to credit and capital in the future and adversely impact our business plans and operating model. Our credit rating and the market value of our common stock could also be affected. While we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future, if we are unable to refinance or repay our outstanding debt when due, our results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges to estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of our assets or operating results that are lower than our current estimates may cause us to incur impairment losses and require us to write-off all or a portion of the remaining value of our goodwill or other intangibles of companies we have acquired.\nOur total assets include goodwill and other intangible assets. We evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value. We may be required to record a significant non-cash impairment charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill, other intangible assets or other assets is determined, which would negatively impact our results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nAcquisitions and other strategic transactions may not prove successful and could result in operating difficulties and failure to realize anticipated benefits.\nWe regularly consider a wide array of acquisitions and other potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of hotel brands, businesses and real property, joint ventures, business combinations, strategic investments and dispositions. Any of these transactions could be material to our business. We often compete for these opportunities with third parties, which may cause us to lose potential opportunities or to pay more than we may otherwise have paid absent such competition. We may not be able to identify and consummate strategic transactions and opportunities on favorable terms and any such strategic transactions or opportunities, if consummated, may not be successful.\nWe are subject to risks related to litigation.\nWe are subject to a number of disputes, claims, litigation and other legal proceedings as described in this report, and any unfavorable rulings or outcomes in current or future litigation and other legal proceedings may materially harm our business. Along with many of its competitors, the Company and/or certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in litigation matters filed in state and federal courts, alleging statutory and common law claims related to purported incidents of sex trafficking at certain franchised and managed hotel facilities. For additional information, see our Commitments and Contingencies note (Note 13) in the notes to our financial statements.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with regulations may adversely affect us.\nOur operations are regulated by federal, state and local governments in the countries in which we operate. In addition, U.S. and international federal, state and local regulators may enact new laws and regulations that may reduce our profits or require us to modify our business practices substantially. If we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including, among others, those governing franchising, hotel operations, lending, information security, data protection and privacy (such as the General Data Protection Regulation or similar laws or regulations), credit card security standards, marketing, including sales, consumer protection and advertising, unfair and deceptive trade practices, fraud, bribery and corruption, licensing, labor, employment, anti-discrimination, health care, health and safety, accessibility, immigration, gaming, environmental, intellectual property, securities, stock exchange listing, accounting, tax and regulations applicable under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Sherman Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local equivalents in international jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom Bribery Act, we may be subject to regulatory investigations or actions, fines, civil and/or criminal penalties, injunctions and potential criminal prosecution. Changes to such laws and regulations and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect us.\nFailure to maintain the security of personally identifiable and proprietary information, non-compliance with our contractual obligations regarding such information or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such information could adversely affect us.\nIn connection with our business, we and our service providers collect and retain large volumes of certain types of personal and proprietary information pertaining to guests, franchisees, stockholders and employees. Such information includes, but is not limited to, large volumes of guest credit and payment card information. We are at risk of attack by cyber-criminals operating on a global basis attempting to gain access to such information. In connection with data security incidents involving a group of Wyndham brand hotels that occurred between 2008 and 2010, one of our subsidiaries is subject to a stipulated order with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), pursuant to which, among other things, it is required to maintain an information security program for payment card information within its network, and which provides it with a safe harbor provided it continues to meet certain requirements for reasonable data security as outlined in the stipulated order.\nWhile we maintain what we believe are reasonable security controls over personal and proprietary information, a breach of or breakdown in our systems that results in the unauthorized release of personal or proprietary information could nevertheless occur or our subsidiary could fail to comply with the stipulated order with the FTC. Additionally, the legal and regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy in the U.S. and international jurisdictions is constantly evolving. Violation or non-compliance with any of these laws or regulations, contractual requirements relating to data security and privacy, or with our own privacy and security policies, either intentionally or unintentionally, or through the acts of intermediaries could have a material adverse effect on our hotel brands, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as subject us to significant fines, litigation, losses, third-party damages and other liabilities.\nWe rely on information technologies and systems to operate our business, which involves reliance on third-party service providers and on uninterrupted operation of service facilities.\nWe rely on information technologies and systems to operate our business, which involves reliance on third-party service providers such as Sabre Corporation and its SynXis Platform and uninterrupted operations of service facilities, including those used for reservation systems, hotel/property management, communications, procurement, call centers, operation of our loyalty program and administrative systems. We and our vendors also maintain physical facilities to support these systems and related services. As a result, in addition to failures that occur from time to time in the ordinary course, we and our vendors may be vulnerable to system failures, computer hacking, cyber-terrorism, computer viruses and other intentional or unintentional interference, negligence, fraud, misuse and other unauthorized attempts to access or interfere with these systems and our personal and proprietary information. The increased scope and complexity of our information technology infrastructure and systems could contribute to the potential risk of security breaches or breakdown. Any natural disaster, disruption or other impairment in our technology capabilities and service facilities or those of our vendors could adversely affect our business. In addition, failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position.\nWe are dependent on our senior management and the loss of any member of our senior management could harm our business.\nWe believe that our future growth depends in part on the continued services of our senior management team. Losing the services of any members of our senior management team could adversely affect our strategic relationships and impede our ability to execute our business strategies. The market for qualified individuals may be highly competitive and finding and recruiting suitable replacements for senior management may be difficult, time-consuming and costly.\nThe insurance we carry may not always pay, or be sufficient to pay or reimburse us, for our liabilities, losses or replacement costs.\nWe carry insurance for general liability, property, business interruption and other insurable risks with respect to our business and franchised, managed and owned hotels. We also self-insure for certain risks up to certain monetary limits. The insurance coverage we carry, subject to our deductible, may not be sufficient to pay or reimburse us for the amount of our liabilities, losses or replacement costs, and there may also be risks for which we do not obtain insurance in the full amount or any amount concerning a potential loss or liability, or at all, due to the cost or availability of such insurance. As a result, we may incur liabilities or losses in the operation of our business that are not sufficiently covered by the insurance we maintain, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility.\nOur business, along with the hospitality industry generally, faces scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance activities and the risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our hotel brands if we fail to act responsibly or comply with regulatory requirements in a number of areas, such as safety and security, responsible tourism, environmental stewardship, supply chain management, climate change, diversity, philanthropy and support for local communities.\nWe are subject to risks related to human trafficking allegations.\nOur business, along with the hospitality industry generally, faces risk that could cause damage to our reputation and the value of our hotel brands along with litigation-related fees and costs in connection with claims, actions, litigations and other legal proceedings alleging statutory and common law claims related to purported incidents of sex trafficking at hotel facilities.\nRisks Relating to the Spin-Off\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the expected benefits from our spin-off from Wyndham Destinations.\nAs a result of our separation from Wyndham Destinations, we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than we would have been were we still a part of Wyndham Destinations. If we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits or do not achieve them in the timeframe expected, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have a limited operating history as a separate public company, our financial information from before the spin-off from Wyndham Destinations may not reflect our current or future results as an independent company and we may not be able to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate as an independent company and, as a result, we may experience increased costs.\nPrior to the spin-off, Wyndham Destinations performed various corporate functions for us, including tax administration, governance, compliance, accounting, internal audit and external reporting. Our historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from Wyndham Destinations for these and similar functions that may be less than the comparable expenses we would have incurred had we operated as a separate publicly traded company. In connection with the spin-off, we entered into transition agreements and licensing, marketing and other agreements that govern certain commercial and other relationships between us and Wyndham Destinations; however, those arrangements may not capture the benefits our business enjoyed as a result of being integrated with the other businesses of Wyndham Destinations prior to the spin-off. The loss of those benefits could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nGenerally, our working capital requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures, were satisfied as part of the corporate-wide cash management policies of Wyndham Destinations before the spin-off. Since the completion of the spin-off, Wyndham Destinations has not and will not be providing us with funds to finance our working capital or other cash requirements, and we may need to obtain financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, strategic relationships or other arrangements. We may be unable to replace in a timely manner or on comparable terms and costs the services or other benefits that Wyndham Destinations previously provided to us, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. In addition, other significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of our operations as a separate company.\nWe may have received better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we received in our agreements with Wyndham Destinations entered into in connection with the spin-off.\nWe entered into agreements with Wyndham Destinations related to the spin-off while we were still part of Wyndham Destinations. Accordingly, these agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm\u2019s-length negotiations among unaffiliated third parties and we may have received better terms from third parties because third parties may have competed with each other to secure our business.\nOur failure to maintain effective internal controls or meet the financial reporting and other requirements to which we are now subject could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs a result of the spin-off, we are subject to reporting and other obligations under U.S. securities laws and are required to comply with applicable internal controls and reporting requirements. If we are unable to maintain adequate financial and management controls, reporting systems, information technology systems and procedures, our ability to comply with the financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under U.S. securities laws may be impaired and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn connection with the spin-off and Wyndham Destinations\u2019 sale of its European vacation rentals business, we agreed to indemnify Wyndham Destinations and Wyndham Destinations agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and if we are required to perform under these indemnities or if Wyndham Destinations is unable to satisfy its obligations under these indemnities, our financial results could be negatively affected.\nThe contingent liabilities we assumed in connection with the spin-off and Wyndham Destinations\u2019 sale of its European vacation rentals business could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In connection with the spin-off, Wyndham Destinations agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify Wyndham Destinations for certain liabilities, including cross-indemnities that are principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business with us, and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of Wyndham Destinations\u2019 business with Wyndham Destinations. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement (the \u201cSDA\u201d), we assumed one-third and Wyndham Destinations assumed two-thirds of certain contingent and other corporate liabilities of Wyndham Destinations, which we refer to in this Report as \u201cshared contingent liabilities,\u201d incurred prior to the spin-off, including liabilities of Wyndham Destinations related to, arising out of or resulting from certain terminated or divested businesses, certain general corporate matters of Wyndham Destinations and any actions with respect to the spin-off brought by any third party.\nAdditionally, in connection with the sale of Wyndham Destinations\u2019 European vacation rentals business, we provided certain post-closing credit support in the form of guarantees, which as of December 31, 2019 were approximately $127 million, to ensure that the business meets the requirements of certain service providers and regulatory authorities. Such post-closing credit support may be enforced or called upon if the European vacation rentals business fails to meet its primary obligation to pay certain amounts when due. The European vacation rentals business has provided an indemnity to Wyndham Destinations in the event that the post-closing credit support is enforced or called upon. Pursuant to the terms of the SDA, we assumed one-third and Wyndham Destinations assumed two-thirds of any such losses actually incurred by Wyndham Destinations or us in the event that these credit support arrangements are enforced or called upon by any beneficiary and any amounts paid by Wyndham Destinations or us in respect of any indemnification claims made in connection with the sale of the European vacation rentals business.\nShould our indemnification obligations exceed applicable insurance coverage, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, the indemnities from Wyndham Destinations may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these and other liabilities. Third parties also could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Wyndham Destinations has agreed to assume. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Wyndham Destinations any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear those losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe spin-off and related transactions may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.\nAlthough we received a solvency opinion from an investment bank confirming that we and Wyndham Destinations were adequately capitalized immediately after the spin-off, the spin-off could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. An unpaid creditor could claim that Wyndham Destinations did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the spin-off, and that the spin-off left Wyndham Destinations insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that Wyndham Destinations intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. If a court were to void the spin-off as a fraudulent transfer, it could impose a number of different remedies, including, returning our assets or your shares in our company to Wyndham Destinations or providing Wyndham Destinations with a claim for money damages against us in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by Wyndham Destinations and the fair market value of our Company at the time of the spin-off.\nCertain of our Directors and executive officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their ownership of Wyndham Destinations equity or their current or former positions at Wyndham Destinations.\nTwo of our Directors also serve on the Wyndham Destinations Board and certain of our executive officers and non-employee Directors own shares of Wyndham Destinations common stock because of their current or former positions with Wyndham Destinations. This could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our or Wyndham Destinations\u2019 management, officers and directors face decisions that could have different implications for us and Wyndham Destinations.\nIf the spin-off, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, then our stockholders, we and Wyndham Destinations might be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes.\nThe spin-off was conditioned upon Wyndham Destinations\u2019 receipt of opinions of its spin-off tax advisors to the effect that, subject to the assumptions and limitations described in the opinions, the spin-off, together with certain related transactions, would qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), in which no gain or loss would be recognized by Wyndham Destinations or its stockholders, except, in the case of Wyndham Destinations stockholders, for cash received in lieu of fractional shares, which opinions were delivered on the closing date of the spin-off. The opinions of the spin-off tax\nadvisors are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) or a court, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the validity of the spin-off and such related transactions as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code eligible for tax-free treatment, or that any such challenge ultimately will not prevail.\nIn addition, Wyndham Destinations received certain rulings from the IRS regarding certain U.S. federal income tax aspects of transactions related to the spin-off. Although the IRS Ruling generally is binding on the IRS, the continued validity\nof the IRS Ruling is based upon and subject to the continuing accuracy of factual statements and representations made to the IRS by Wyndham Destinations.\nIf the spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free transaction for any reason, including as a result of a breach of a representation or covenant with respect to such tax opinions or the IRS Ruling, Wyndham Destinations would recognize a substantial gain attributable to our hotel business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, under U.S. Treasury regulations, each member of the Wyndham Destinations consolidated group at the time of the spin-off, including us and certain of our subsidiaries, would be jointly and severally liable for the entire resulting amount of any U.S. federal income tax liability.\nOur ability to engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions is subject to limitations because we have agreed to certain restrictions intended to support the tax-free nature of the distribution.\nThe U.S. federal income tax laws that apply to transactions like the spin-off generally create a presumption that the distribution would be taxable to Wyndham Destinations but not to Wyndham Destinations stockholders if we engage in, or enter into an agreement to engage in, a transaction that would result in a 50% or greater change by vote or by value in our stock ownership during the four-year period beginning two years before the distribution date, unless it is established that the transaction is not pursuant to a plan or series or transactions related to the distribution. U.S. Treasury regulations currently in effect generally provide that whether an acquisition transaction and a distribution are part of a plan is determined based on all of the facts and circumstances, including specific factors listed in the Treasury regulations. In addition, these Treasury regulations provide several \"safe harbors\" for acquisition transactions that are not considered to be part of a plan that includes a distribution.\nWe have entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with Wyndham Destinations under which we have allocated, between Wyndham Destinations and ourselves, responsibility for U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. income and other taxes relating to taxable periods before and after the spin-off and provided for computing and apportioning tax liabilities and tax benefits between the parties. In the Tax Matters Agreement, we have agreed that we may not take, or fail to take, certain actions following the spin-off if such action, or failure to act, would be inconsistent with or prohibit the spin-off and certain related transactions from qualifying as a tax-free reorganization under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 and related provisions of the Code (including the limitations on certain changes in stock ownership described above).\nThese restrictions could limit our strategic and operational flexibility, including our ability to finance our operations by issuing equity securities, make acquisitions using equity securities, repurchase our equity securities, or raise money by selling assets or enter into business combination transactions. We have also agreed to indemnify Wyndham Destinations for certain tax liabilities resulting from any such transactions. Further, our stockholders may consider these covenants and indemnity obligations unfavorable as they might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including our ability to achieve growth and performance objectives, the success or failure of our business strategy, general economic conditions, our quarterly or annual earnings and those of other companies in our industry, changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, changes in laws and regulations, increased competition and changes affecting the travel industry and other events impacting our business. The stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate governance documents and Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our business, which could decrease the market price of our common stock.\nOur corporate governance documents and Delaware law contain provisions that are intended to deter or delay coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids, including requiring advance notice for stockholder proposals, placing limitations on convening stockholder meetings, authorizing our Board to issue one or more series of preferred stock, a supermajority (80% of outstanding shares) vote requirement to amend our by-laws and certain provisions of our charter, and providing for the classification of our Board until the third annual meeting of stockholders following the spin-off. Additionally, Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any\nholder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. These provisions may prevent or delay an acquisition that some stockholders may consider beneficial, which could decrease the market price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated by-laws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our Directors or employees.\nOur amended and restated by-laws provide that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for derivative actions; claims related to a breach of a fiduciary duty, corporate law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; or under the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our Directors or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our amended and restated by-laws inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and Board.\nWe may not pay dividends on our common stock, and the terms our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nThe declaration and payment of dividends are at the sole discretion of our Board and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions under our indebtedness and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. Though we expect to make regular dividends, there can be no assurance that a payment of a dividend will occur in the future.", "PERMNO": 17794, "SIC": 7011, "TIC": "WH"}
