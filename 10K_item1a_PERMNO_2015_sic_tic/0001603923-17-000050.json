{"cik": "1603923", "company": "Weatherford International plc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves various risks. You should consider carefully all of the risk factors described below, the matters discussed herein under \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d and other information included and incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the SEC. If any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this Form 10-K were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDemand for our services and products is affected by fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, especially a substantial or extended decline, which, in turn, affect the level of exploration, development and production activity of our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and impede our growth.\nDemand for our services and products is tied to the level of exploration, development and production activity and the corresponding capital expenditures by oil and natural gas companies, including national oil companies. The level of exploration, development and production activity is directly affected by fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, especially given current geopolitical and economic conditions. Therefore, declines in oil and natural gas prices or sustained low oil and natural gas prices (as has occurred since late 2014) or customer perceptions that oil and natural gas prices will remain depressed or further decrease in the future could result in a continued reduction in the demand and pricing for our equipment and will likely continue at lower rates for our services.\nPrices for oil and natural gas are highly volatile and are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas. For example, during 2016, West Texas Intermediate (\u201cWTI\u201d) crude oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange fluctuated from a low of less than $27.00 per barrel in the first quarter to a high of $54.06 per barrel in late December. Factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations include: excess supply of crude oil relative to demand; domestic and international drilling activity; global market uncertainty; the risk of slowing economic growth or recession in the United States, China, Europe or emerging markets; the ability of OPEC to set and maintain production levels for oil; the decision of OPEC to abandon production quotas and/or member-country quota compliance within OPEC; oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries; the nature and extent of governmental regulation, including environmental regulation; technological advances affecting energy consumption; adverse weather conditions and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control. Any perceived or actual further reduction in oil and natural gas prices will depress the immediate levels of exploration, development and production activity and decrease spending by our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe substantial and sustained decline in oil and natural gas prices has led to a significant decrease in spending by our customers over the past two years, and further decreases in oil and natural gas prices could lead to further cuts in spending. Our customers also take into account the volatility of energy prices and other risk factors when determining whether to pursue capital projects and higher perceived risks generally mandate higher required returns. Any of these factors could affect the demand for oil and natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur business is dependent on capital spending by our customers, and reductions in capital spending by our customers has had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe substantial and sustained decline in oil and natural gas prices has led to a significant decrease in capital expenditures by our customers. Most of our contracts can be cancelled by our customer at any time. Low commodity prices, the short-term tenor of most of our contracts and the extreme financial stress experienced by our customers (some of whom may have to seek bankruptcy protection) have combined to generate demands by many of our customers for significant reductions in the prices of our products\nand services. Further reductions in capital spending or requests for further cost reductions by our customers could directly impact our business by reducing demand for our services and products and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Spending by exploration and production companies can also be impacted by conditions in the capital markets, which have been volatile in recent years. Limitations on the availability of capital or higher costs of capital may cause exploration and production companies to make additional reductions to capital budgets even if oil and natural gas prices increase from current levels. Any such cuts in spending will curtail drilling programs as well as discretionary spending on well services, which may result in a reduction in the demand for our services, the rates we can charge and the utilization of our assets. Moreover, reduced discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves or a decrease in the development rate of reserves in our market areas, whether due to increased governmental regulation, limitations on exploration and drilling activity or other factors, could also have a material adverse impact on our business, even in a stronger oil and natural gas price environment. With respect to national oil company customers, we are also subject to risk of policy, regime, currency and budgetary changes all of which may affect their capital expenditures.\nThe credit risks of our concentrated customer base in the energy industry could result in losses.\nThe concentration of our customer base in the energy industry may impact our overall exposure to credit risk as our customers may be similarly affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry conditions. Some of our customers are experiencing extreme financial distress as a result of falling commodity prices and may be forced to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws. Furthermore, countries that rely heavily upon income from hydrocarbon exports have been negatively and significantly affected by the drop in oil prices, which could affect our ability to collect from our customers in these countries, particularly national oil companies. Laws in some jurisdictions in which we operate could make collection difficult or time consuming. We perform on-going credit evaluations of our customers and do not generally require collateral in support of our trade receivables. While we maintain reserves for potential credit losses, we cannot assure such reserves will be sufficient to meet write-offs of uncollectible receivables or that our losses from such receivables will be consistent with our expectations. Additionally, in the event of a bankruptcy of any of our customers, we may be treated as an unsecured creditor and may collect substantially less, or none, of the amounts owed to us by such customer.\nSeasonal and weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our services and operations.\nVariation from normal weather patterns, such as cooler or warmer summers and winters, can have a significant impact on demand. Adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico or extreme winter conditions in Canada, Russia and the North Sea, may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers\u2019 operations, cause supply disruptions or loss of productivity or result in a loss of revenue or damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe oilfield services business is highly competitive, which may adversely affect our ability to succeed. Additionally, the impact of consolidation and acquisitions of our competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business.\nOur business is highly competitive, particularly with respect to marketing our products and services to our customers and securing equipment and trained personnel. Currently the oilfield service industry has significant excess capacity relative to customer demand, and, in most cases, multiple sources of comparable oilfield services are available from a number of different competitors. This competitive environment could impact our ability to maintain market share, defend, maintain or increase pricing for our products and services and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers and suppliers. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to add value for our customers by providing, relative to our peers, new technologies, reliable products and services and competent personnel. The anticipated timing and cost of the development of competitive technology and new product introductions can impact our financial results, particularly if one of our competitors were to develop competing technology that accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services. Additionally, we may be disadvantaged competitively and financially by a significant movement of exploration and production operations to areas of the world in which we are not currently active, particularly if one or more of our competitors is already operating in that area of the world.\nRecent, ongoing, and future mergers, combinations and consolidations in our industry could result in existing competitors increasing their market share and may result in stronger competitors, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In 2016, Baker Hughes and GE Oil and Gas announced a plan to merge after the planned merger between Baker Hughes and Halliburton was called off earlier in the year. In 2016, Schlumberger and Cameron International completed their previously announced merger. We may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our other competitors or us.\nPhysical dangers are inherent in our operations and may expose us to significant potential losses. Personnel and property may be harmed during the process of drilling for oil and natural gas.\nDrilling for and producing hydrocarbons, and the associated products and services that we provide, include inherent dangers that may lead to property damage, personal injury, death or the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment. Many of these events are outside our control. Typically, we provide products and services at a well site where our personnel and equipment are located together with personnel and equipment of our customer and third parties, such as other service providers. At many sites, we depend on other companies and personnel to conduct drilling operations in accordance with appropriate safety standards. From time to time, personnel are injured or equipment or property is damaged or destroyed as a result of accidents, failed equipment, faulty products or services, failure of safety measures, uncontained formation pressures or other dangers inherent in drilling for oil and natural gas. Any of these events can be the result of human error. With increasing frequency, our products and services are deployed on more challenging prospects both onshore and offshore, where the occurrence of the types of events mentioned above can have an even more catastrophic impact on people, equipment and the environment. Such events may expose us to significant potential losses.\nWe may not be fully indemnified against financial losses in all circumstances where damage to or loss of property, personal injury, death or environmental harm occur.\nAs is customary in our industry, our contracts typically require that our customers indemnify us for claims arising from the injury or death of their employees (and those of their other contractors), the loss or damage of their equipment (and that of their other contractors), damage to the well or reservoir and pollution originating from the customer\u2019s equipment or from the reservoir (including uncontained oil flow from a reservoir) and claims arising from catastrophic events, such as a well blowout, fire, explosion and from pollution below the surface. Conversely, we typically indemnify our customers for claims arising from the injury or death of our employees, the loss or damage of our equipment (other than equipment lost in the hole) or pollution originating from our equipment above the surface of the earth or water.\nOur indemnification arrangements may not protect us in every case. For example, from time to time we may enter into contracts with less favorable indemnities or perform work without a contract that protects us. Our indemnity arrangements may also be held to be overly broad in some courts and/or contrary to public policy in some jurisdictions, and to that extent unenforceable. Additionally, some jurisdictions which permit indemnification nonetheless limit its scope by statute. We may be subject to claims brought by third parties or government agencies with respect to which we are not indemnified. Furthermore, the parties from which we seek indemnity may not be solvent, may become bankrupt, may lack resources or insurance to honor their indemnities or may not otherwise be able to satisfy their indemnity obligations to us. The lack of enforceable indemnification could expose us to significant potential losses.\nFurther, our assets generally are not insured against loss from political violence such as war, terrorism or civil commotion. If any of our assets are damaged or destroyed as a result of an uninsured cause, we could recognize a loss of those assets.\nOur business may be exposed to uninsured claims and, as a result, litigation might result in significant potential losses. The cost of our insured risk management program may increase.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we become the subject of various claims and litigation. We maintain liability insurance, which includes insurance against damage to people, property and the environment, up to maximum limits of $600 million, subject to self-insured retentions and deductibles.\nOur insurance policies are subject to exclusions, limitations and other conditions and may not apply in all cases, for example where willful wrongdoing on our part is alleged. It is possible an unexpected judgment could be rendered against us in cases in which we could be uninsured and beyond the amounts we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring, and in some cases those potential losses could be material.\nOur insurance may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or our insurance may not cover all losses. For example, although we maintain product liability insurance, this type of insurance is limited in coverage and it is possible an adverse claim could arise in excess of our coverage. Additionally, insurance rates have in the past been subject to wide fluctuation and may be unavailable on terms that we or our customers believe are economically acceptable. Reductions in coverage, changes in the insurance markets and accidents affecting our industry may result in further increases in our cost and higher deductibles and retentions in future years and may also result in reduced activity levels in certain markets. Any of these events would have an adverse impact on our financial performance.\nOur operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, that may expose us to significant liabilities and could reduce our business opportunities and revenues.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the energy industry in general and the environment in particular. These laws are often complex and may not always be applied consistently in emerging markets. These laws and regulations often change and can cover broad subject matters, including tax, trade, customs (import/export) and the environment. In the case of environmental regulations, an environmental claim could arise with respect to one or more of our current businesses, products or services, or a business or property that one of our predecessors owned or used, and such claims could involve material expenditures. Generally, environmental laws have in recent years become more stringent and have sought to impose greater liability on a larger number of potentially responsible parties. The scope of regulation of our industry and our products and services may increase further, including possible increases in liabilities or funding requirements imposed by governmental agencies. We also cannot ensure that our future business in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, if any, will be profitable in light of regulations that have been, and may continue to be, promulgated and in light of the current risk environment and insurance markets. Additional regulations on deepwater drilling elsewhere in the world could be imposed, and those regulations could limit our business where they are imposed.\nIn addition, members of the U.S. Congress, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and various agencies of several states within the U.S. frequently review, consider and propose more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing, a service we previously provided (and may, in the future, resume providing) to clients and regulators are investigating whether any chemicals used in the fracturing process might adversely affect groundwater or whether the fracturing processes could lead to other unintended effects or damages. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report regarding the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that water cycle activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances. In recent years, several cities and states within the U.S. passed new laws and regulations concerning or banning hydraulic fracturing. A significant portion of North American service activity today is directed at prospects that require hydraulic fracturing in order to produce hydrocarbons. Therefore, additional regulation could increase the costs of conducting our business by subjecting fracturing to more stringent regulation. Such regulation, among other things, may change construction standards for wells intended for hydraulic fracturing, require additional certifications concerning the conduct of hydraulic fracturing operations, change requirements pertaining to the management of water used in hydraulic fracturing operations, require other measures intended to prevent operational hazards or ban hydraulic fracturing completely. Any such federal, state, local or foreign legislation could increase our costs of providing services or could materially reduce our business opportunities and revenues if our customers decrease their levels of activity in response to such regulation or if we are not able to pass along any cost increases to our customers. We are unable to predict whether changes in laws or regulations or any other governmental proposals or responses will ultimately occur, and accordingly, we are unable to assess the potential financial or operational impact they may have on our business.\nFinally, in December 2015, the U.S. joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France that requires member countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. The agreement entered into was in full force in November 2016. The implementation of this treaty and other efforts to reduce GHG emissions in the U.S. and other countries could materially affect our customers by reducing demand for oil and natural gas, thereby potentially materially affecting demand for our services.\nWe conduct some of our business using fixed-fee or turn-key contracts, which subject us to risks associated with cost over-runs, operating cost inflation and potential claims for liquidated damages.\nWe conduct our business under various types of contracts, including in some cases fixed-fee or turn-key contracts where we estimate costs in advance of our performance. We price these types of contracts based in part on assumptions including prices and availability of labor, equipment and materials as well as productivity, performance and future economic conditions. If our cost estimates prove inaccurate, there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather delays, changes in the costs of equipment and materials or our suppliers\u2019 or subcontractors\u2019 inability to perform, then cost over-runs may occur. We may not be able to obtain compensation for additional work performed or expenses incurred in all cases. Additionally, in some contracts we may be required to pay liquidated damages if we do not achieve schedule or performance requirements of our contracts. Our failure to accurately estimate the resources and time required for fixed-fee contracts or our failure to complete our contractual obligations within the time frame and costs committed could result in reduced profits or a loss for that contract. If the contract is significant, or we encounter issues that impact multiple contracts, cost over-runs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, as of December 31, 2016, we recognized cumulative estimated project losses totaling $532 million related to our long-term early production facility construction contracts in Iraq that are accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method.\nIf our long-lived assets, goodwill, other intangible assets and other assets are further impaired, we may be required to record significant non-cash charges to our earnings.\nWe recognize impairments of goodwill to its implied fair value when the fair value of any of our reporting units becomes less than its carrying value. Our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions about future cash flows of each reporting unit, discount rates applied to these cash flows and current market estimates of value. Based on the uncertainty of future revenue growth rates, gross profit performance, and other assumptions used to estimate our reporting units\u2019 fair value, future reductions in our expected cash flows could cause a material non-cash impairment charge of goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also have certain long-lived assets, other intangible assets and other assets which could be at risk of impairment or may require reserves based upon anticipated future benefits to be derived from such assets. Any change in the valuation of such assets could have a material effect on our profitability. For example, during 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized long-lived asset impairment charges of $436 million, $638 million and $495 million, respectively.\nWe have significant operations that would be adversely impacted in the event of war, political instability or disruption, civil disturbance, regime changes, treaty changes, economic and legal sanctions, pandemics, changes in global trade policies or weak local economic conditions.\nLike most multinational oilfield service companies, we have operations in certain international areas, including parts of the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, the Asia Pacific, Europe and Russia regions that are subject to significant risks of war, political instability and disruption, civil disturbance, regime changes, treaty changes, economic and legal sanctions (such as restrictions against countries that the U.S. government may deem to sponsor terrorism), pandemics, changes in global trade policies or weak local economic conditions. Our operations, which are subject to these various risks unique to each country in which we operate, may be restricted or prohibited if any of the foregoing risks occur, which in turn, could materially and adversely impact our results of operations:\n\u2022\ndisruption of oil and natural gas exploration and production activities;\n\u2022\nrestriction of the movement and exchange of funds;\n\u2022\nour inability to collect receivables;\n\u2022\nloss of or nationalization of assets in affected jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nenactment of additional or stricter U.S., EU or other applicable government or international sanctions; and\n\u2022\nlimitation of our access to markets for periods of time.\nFor example, the economic sanctions against Russia resulting from its annexation of the Crimean region of Ukraine in March 2014 have, and may continue to, adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition of our Russia operations. In the event of further sanctions or changes to existing sanctions our ability to do business in Russia may be further reduced or impacted.\nWe risk loss of assets in any location where hostilities arise and persist. In these areas we also may not be able to perform the work we are contracted to perform, which could lead to forfeiture of performance bonds, or we may not be able to collect payment for work performed. Political instability in our regions of operation may also result in the need for additional security, resources and ability to quickly navigate a changing landscape. In addition, the trade and investment policies of the current U.S. administration regarding some jurisdictions where we operate is currently unclear.\nWe may not be able to complete the contemplated divestiture of our land drilling rigs or our pressure pumping business and we may not achieve the intended benefits of our 2014 divestitures.\nIn 2014, we divested certain of our non-core businesses (land drilling rigs in Russia and Venezuela, engineered chemistry and Integrity drilling fluids, pipeline and specialty services and production services). Due to sustained unfavorable market conditions, we have not yet completed the divestiture of the remaining portion of our land drilling rigs. Any such divestiture, accomplished through an initial public offering, a spin-off, an asset sale, or some combination of the foregoing, will be complex in nature and may be affected by unanticipated developments, such as the continued significant and sustained decrease in the price of crude oil, delays in obtaining regulatory or governmental approvals and challenges in establishing processes and infrastructure for both the underlying business and for potential investors or buyers of the business, which may result in such divestiture being delayed, or not being completed at all. There is no guarantee that we will fully realize the intended benefits of consummating such divestiture transactions.\nIn addition, in November 2016, we shut down our U.S. pressure pumping operations and idled the related assets. We currently intend to dispose of all assets, the related infrastructure and commitments, which we may not be able to conclude on in the intended time frame or with favorable pricing and terms.\nWe have been the subject of governmental and internal investigations related to alleged corrupt conduct and violations of U.S. sanctioned country laws, which were costly to conduct, resulted in a loss of revenue and substantial financial penalties and created other disruptions for the business. If we are the subject of such investigations in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2013 and 2014, we settled investigations of prior alleged violations by us and certain of our subsidiaries related to certain trade sanctions laws, participation in the United Nations oil-for-food program governing sales of goods into Iraq and non-compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d). These settlement agreements required us to pay $253 million and to retain, for a period of 18 months, an independent monitor responsible for assessing our compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements so as to address and reduce the risk of recurrence of alleged misconduct. Notwithstanding such internal control policies and procedures, including those related to training and compliance, programs for our employees and agents with respect to the FCPA, we cannot assure that our policies, procedures and programs always will prevent or protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents.\nTo the extent we violate trade sanctions laws, the FCPA , the United Kingdom Bribery Act, or other laws or regulations in the future, additional fines and other penalties may be imposed and there would be uncertainty as to the ultimate amount of any penalties we could pay and there can be no assurance that actual fines or penalties, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor additional information about these actions and claims, you should refer to the section entitled \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 21 - Disputes, Litigation and Contingencies.\u201d\nIf another party claims that we have infringed its intellectual property rights, we may be subject to litigation or we may need to take remedial steps to eliminate or mitigate liability.\nA third party may claim that we sell equipment or perform services that infringes the third party\u2019s patent rights or unlawfully uses the third party\u2019s trade secrets. Addressing such claims of patent infringement or trade secret misappropriation could result in significant legal and other costs, and may adversely impact our business. To resolve such claims, we may be required to enter into license agreements that require us to make royalty payments to continue selling equipment or providing of services. Alternatively, the development of non-infringing technologies could be costly. If an allegation of patent infringement or trade secret misappropriation cannot be resolved through a license agreement, we might not be able to continue selling particular equipment or providing particular services, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nOur significant international operations subject us to economic and repatriation risks, and we may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency including devaluation and changes in local banking and currency regulations and exchange controls.\nWe operate in virtually every oil and natural gas exploration and production region in the world. In some parts of the world, such as Latin America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, the currency of our primary economic environment is generally the U.S. dollar, and we use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency. In other parts of the world, we conduct our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and the functional currency is generally the applicable local currency. As such, we are exposed to significant currency exchange risk and devaluation risk. For example, in 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized pre-tax currency-related charges of $41 million, $85 million and $245 million, respectively. In 2016, currency devaluation charges reflect the impact of the devaluation of the Angolan kwanza and the Egyptian pound. In 2015, currency devaluation charges reflect the impacts of the devaluation of the Angolan kwanza and Argentine peso and the recognized remeasurement charges related to the Venezuelan bolivar and the Kazakhstani tenge. The charges in 2014 were related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. For information about the currency devaluations, refer to the section entitled \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d Any future change in the exchange rates in these or other countries could cause us to take additional charges on the foreign denominated assets held by our subsidiaries.\nWe are also subject to risks resulting from changes in the implementation of exchange controls, as well as limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries. If we are unable to reinvest earnings or repatriate foreign income, our liquidity may be negatively affected. Additionally, changing tax rules could result in an increased income tax expense on repatriation of funds.\nOur business in Venezuela subjects us to actions by the Venezuelan government or our primary customer which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe future results of our Venezuelan operations may be adversely affected by many factors, including our ability to take action to mitigate the effect of future exchange controls, actions of the Venezuelan government and the general economic conditions in the country, continued inflation, and future customer payments and spending. We may continue to see a delay in payment on our receivables from our primary customer in Venezuela or may be compelled to accept bonds as payment, which may then be sold at a loss, similar to our bond transactions in 2016 and 2013 related to $120 million and $127 million of net trade receivables, respectively. During the second quarter of 2016, we accepted a note with a face value of $120 million from Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (\u201cPDVSA\u201d) in exchange for $120 million in net trade receivables. We carried the note at the lower of cost or fair value and recognized a loss in the second quarter of 2016 of $84 million to adjust the note to fair value. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we sold the economic rights in the note receivable for $44 million. If PDVSA further delays paying or fails to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, or if there is a major action by the Venezuelan government, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nCredit rating agencies have lowered and could further lower our credit ratings.\nOur credit ratings were downgraded by multiple credit rating agencies in 2016 and these agencies could further downgrade our credit ratings. Our Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Ratings (\u201cS&P\u201d) credit rating on our senior unsecured debt and short-term ratings are both currently B with a negative outlook. Our Moody\u2019s Investors Services (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d) rating on our senior unsecured debt is currently Caa1 and our short-term rating is SGL-3, both with a negative outlook. Our Fitch Rating is CCC- for our senior unsecured debt and C for our short-term debt with a negative outlook. The lowering of our credit ratings to non-investment grade levels in 2016 resulted in our loss of access to the commercial paper market for our short-term liquidity needs. Furthermore, our non-investment grade status may further limit our ability to refinance our existing debt, could cause us to refinance or issue debt with less favorable and more restrictive terms and conditions, and could increase certain fees and interest rates of our borrowings. Suppliers and financial institutions may lower or eliminate the level of credit provided through payment terms or intraday funding when dealing with us thereby increasing the need for higher levels of cash on hand, which would decrease our ability to repay debt balances.\nOur indebtedness and liabilities could limit cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our obligations under the notes.\nOur indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our business, results of operations and financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022\nrequiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors or competitors that may have better access to capital resources.\nAny harm to our business and operations resulting from our current or future level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to pay amounts due on the notes.\nIf we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in the agreements governing the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Term Loan Agreement and our other indebtedness, including our indentures, as supplemented (our \u201cindentures\u201d), there could be a default under the terms of these agreements, which could result in an acceleration of payment of funds that we have borrowed and would affect our ability to make principal and interest payments on the notes.\nAny default under the agreements governing our indebtedness that is not cured or waived by the required lenders, and the remedies sought by the holders of any such indebtedness, could make us unable to pay principal and interest on the notes and substantially decrease the market value of the notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the agreements governing our indebtedness (including covenants in the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Term Loan Agreement and our indentures), we could be in default under the terms of such agreements. In the event of such default:\n\u2022\nthe holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest;\n\u2022\nthe lenders under such agreements could elect to terminate their commitment thereunder and cease making further loans; and\n\u2022\nwe could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nIf our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers under the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Term Loan Agreement or our indentures. If we breach our covenants under the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Term Loan Agreement or our indentures, and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders or noteholders. If this occurs, we would be in default under such agreements, the lenders or trustee could exercise their rights or remedies, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nThe terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement restrict, and our indentures will restrict, our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to pursue our business strategies.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement contain, and our indentures will contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make other distributions;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nsell assets and incur liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nAs a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022\nlimited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022\nunable to raise additional debt of equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u2022\nunable to compete effectively, execute our growth strategy or take advantage of new business opportunities.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in the Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement require us to maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control.\nA breach of the covenants under the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Term Loan Agreement or our indentures could result in an event of default thereunder. Such a default may allow the lenders or the trustee to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement or Term Loan Agreement would permit the lenders thereunder to terminate all commitments. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the Term Loan Agreement, the lenders thereunder could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness.\nCapital financing may not be available to us at economic rates.\nCredit and equity markets have been highly volatile in recent years, the cost to obtain capital financing has increased, and some markets may not be available at certain times. Credit and equity market conditions and the potential impact on liquidity of major financial institutions may have an adverse effect on our ability to fund operational needs or other activities through borrowings under either existing or newly created instruments in the public or private markets on terms we believe to be reasonable. If we are unable to borrow further via debt offerings or our credit facility, or to obtain additional equity financing, we could experience a reduction of liquidity and may result in difficulty funding our operations, repayment of short-term borrowings, payments of interest and other obligations. This could be detrimental to our business and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nA terrorist attack or other geopolitical crisis could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nWe operate in many dangerous countries, such as Iraq, Nigeria, and Turkey in which acts of terrorism or political violence are a substantial and frequent risk. We also operate in countries not customarily considered dangerous, where terrorist acts have become more frequent. Such acts could result in kidnappings, illegal detainment, or the loss of life of our employees or contractors, a loss of equipment, which may or may not be insurable in all cases, or a cessation of business in an affected area. We cannot be certain that our security efforts will in all cases be sufficient to deter or prevent acts of political violence or terrorist strikes against us or our customers\u2019 operations.\nOur business could be negatively affected by cybersecurity threats and other disruptions.\nWe rely heavily on information systems to conduct and protect our business. These information systems are increasingly subject to sophisticated cybersecurity threats such as unauthorized access to data and systems, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), computer viruses, or other malicious code, phishing and cyber attacks, and other similar events. These threats arise from numerous sources, not all of which are within our control, including fraud or malice on the part of third parties, accidental technological failure, electrical or telecommunication outages, failures of computer servers or other damage to our property or assets, or outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts.\nGiven the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats, there can be no assurance that the systems we have designed and implemented to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient in preventing all such incidents or attacks, or avoiding a material impact to our systems when such incidents or attacks do occur. If we were to be subject to a cyber incident or attack, it could result in the disclosure of confidential or proprietary customer information, theft or loss of intellectual property, damage to our reputation with our customers and the market, failure to meet customer requirements or customer dissatisfaction, theft or\nexposure to litigation, damage to equipment (which could cause environmental or safety issues) and other financial costs and losses. In addition, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to devote additional resources to continue to enhance our protective measures or to investigate or remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\nOur failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting has resulted in governmental investigations, shareholder lawsuits, significant fines, penalties and settlements, and could further result in material misstatements in our financial statements which, in turn, could require us to restate financial statements, may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could have an adverse effect on our share price or our debt ratings.\nWe have previously identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting that had resulted in a material weakness in accounting for income taxes. As of December 31, 2013, we remediated our material weakness in accounting for income taxes. We cannot assure that additional material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses, cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and/or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, potentially leading to a decline in our share price.\nThe SEC and DOJ were investigating certain accounting issues associated with the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting for income taxes and the restatements of our historical financial statements in 2011 and 2012. In September of 2016, we settled this matter for a total civil monetary penalty of $140 million, with $50 million due within 21 days from the settlement agreement and three installments of $30 million due in 2017. We also agreed to prepare and deliver certain reports and certifications to the SEC for the next 2 years regarding our tax internal controls. For additional information about these actions and claims, you should refer to the section entitled \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 21 - Disputes, Litigation and Contingencies.\u201d\nIn addition to the SEC and DOJ investigations, in the past several years, we, and certain of our directors and officers, have been defendants in several shareholder derivative and class actions. These matters have been costly to settle and have required a significant amount of time and resources. For additional information about these actions and claims, you should refer to the section entitled \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 21 - Disputes, Litigation and Contingencies.\u201d\nAdverse changes in tax laws both in the United States and abroad, changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn 2002, we reorganized from the United States to a foreign jurisdiction. There are frequent legislative proposals in the United States that attempt to treat companies that have undertaken similar transactions as U.S. corporations subject to U.S. taxes or to limit the tax deductions or tax credits available to United States subsidiaries of these corporations. Our tax expense could be impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable law by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other taxing jurisdictions, acting in unison or separately. The inability to reduce our tax expense could have a material impact on our financial statements.\nThe Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d), which represents a coalition of member countries, has issued various white papers addressing Tax Base Erosion and Jurisdictional Profit Shifting. The recommendations in these white papers are generally aimed at combating what they believe is tax avoidance. Numerous jurisdictions in which we operate have been influenced by these white papers as well as other factors and are increasingly active in evaluating changes to their tax laws. Changes in tax laws could significantly increase our tax expense and require us to take actions, at potential significant expense, to seek to preserve our current level of tax expense.\nOur effective tax rate has fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future. Future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries in which we operate with differing tax rates, changes in tax laws, or changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We assess our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether a valuation allowance may be required. We have recorded a valuation allowance on substantially all of our current and future deferred tax assets. A prolonged downturn could result in us not being able to benefit future losses, which would negatively impact our financial results.\nWe may be prohibited from fully using our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, which could affect our financial performance.\nAs a result of the recent losses we have incurred in the U.S., we have a valuation allowance against all future tax benefits of our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. As of December 31, 2016, we had gross net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) and research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1.7 billion and $30 million, respectively for federal income tax purposes, expiring in varying amounts through the year 2036. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. As of December 31, 2016, we have not experienced an ownership change. Therefore our utilization of NOL carryforwards was not subject to an annual limitation. However, we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOL carryforwards is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. Furthermore, these losses could expire before we generate sufficient income to utilize them.\nThe anticipated benefits of our redomestication to Ireland may not be realized. Additionally, we and our shareholders could be subject to increased taxation if we are considered to be a tax resident in both Switzerland and Ireland.\nIn 2014, we redomesticated from Switzerland to Ireland. We may not realize the benefits we anticipate from this redomestication. Our failure to realize those benefits could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, while we moved our place of incorporation from Switzerland to Ireland in 2014, we continue to be effectively managed from Switzerland. Under current Swiss law a company is regarded as a Swiss tax resident if it has its place of effective management in Switzerland or is incorporated in Switzerland. Where a company is treated as a tax resident of Switzerland as a result of having its place of effective management in Switzerland, Irish law provides Ireland will generally treat the company as not resident in Ireland for Irish tax purposes. We intend to maintain our place of effective management in Switzerland and therefore qualify as a Swiss, but not Irish, tax resident. However, it is possible that in the future, whether as a result of a change in law or tax treaty or how we manage our business that we could become a tax resident in Ireland in addition to Switzerland. If we were to be considered to be a tax resident of Ireland, we could become liable for Irish and Swiss corporation tax and any dividends paid to its shareholders could be subject to Irish and Swiss dividend withholding tax.\nThe rights of our shareholders are governed by Irish law; Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.\nAs an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, provisions relating to interested directors, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States. Additionally, while we are an Irish company, we hold shareholders meetings in Switzerland, which may make attendance in person more difficult for some investors.\nWe are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States.\nWe are organized under the laws of Ireland, and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States. The United States currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. As such, a shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in Ireland. In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. The laws of Ireland do, however, as a general rule, provide that the judgments of the courts of the United States have the same validity in Ireland as if rendered by Irish Courts. Certain important requirements must be satisfied before the Irish Courts will recognize the U.S. judgment. The originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction, the judgment must be final and conclusive and the judgment may not be recognized if it was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to Irish public policy. Any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in Ireland.\nSimilarly, judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the United States where we have assets.", "PERMNO": 32791, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "WFTLF"}
