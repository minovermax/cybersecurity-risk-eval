{"cik": "1336545", "company": "AMERICAN APPAREL, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business involves various risks and uncertainties in addition to the normal risks of business, some of which are discussed in this section. It should be noted that our business may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control. In addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. Any such risks or uncertainties, or any of the following risks or uncertainties, that develop into actual events could result in a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\nThe information discussed below should be considered carefully with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other documents and materials filed by us with the SEC, as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by us from time to time.\nRisks Related to the Company's Business\nTurnover of our key executives and Board of Directors (the \"Board\") and difficulty of recruiting and retaining key employees could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe experienced a significant amount of executive-level turnover in 2014, which has had and could continue to have a negative impact on our ability to retain key executives and employees and could have a material negative impact on our operations. We recently appointed newly hired executives as CEO, CFO, and General Counsel, among others, and seven of the nine members of the Board, including our current Chair of the Board, were appointed since July 2014. We cannot provide assurance that we will effectively manage this or any other management transition, which may impact our ability to retain our remaining key executives and employees and which could harm our business and operations to the extent there is customer or employee uncertainty regarding the prospects of our business.\nThe termination of Dov Charney as our chief executive officer could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOn June 18, 2014, the Board voted to replace Dov Charney as Chairman of the Board, suspended him and notified him of its intent to terminate his employment as our Chairman and CEO for cause. In connection with the Nomination, Standstill and Support Agreement, dated July 9, 2014 (the \"Standstill and Support Agreement\"), the Board formed a new special committee (the \"Suitability Committee\") for the purpose of overseeing the investigation into alleged misconduct by Mr. Charney (the \"Internal Investigation\"). Based on the findings of the Internal Investigations in December 2014, the Suitability Committee determined that it would be inappropriate for Mr. Charney to be reinstated as our CEO or serve as an officer or employee of us or any of our subsidiaries, and the Board terminated Mr. Charney for cause under his employment agreement.\nThere can be no assurance that Mr. Charney's termination and any transition in management arising from his termination will not have a material adverse impact on our business or our ability to hire and retain employees and executive officers. In addition, as a result of the findings of the Internal Investigation and/or the determination to terminate Mr. Charney for cause, we may incur liability as a result of litigation and regulatory investigations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe depend on key personnel, and our ability to grow and compete will be harmed if we do not retain the continued services of such personnel or we fail to identify, hire and retain additional qualified personnel.\nWe depend on the efforts and skills of our management team and other key personnel, and the loss of services of one or more members of this team, many of whom have substantial experience in the apparel industry, could have an adverse effect on our business. Our senior officers closely supervise all aspects of our business, in particular the design and production of merchandise and the operation of our stores.\nIf we are unable to hire and retain qualified management or if any member of our management leaves, such departure could adversely affect our operations and ability to design new products and to maintain and grow the distribution channels for our products. In addition, the Board's decision to terminate Mr. Charney as our CEO and to not reinstate Mr. Charney in another capacity could result in departure of other key employees.\nOur ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing fashion trends depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel in our design, merchandising and marketing areas, and other functions. In addition, if we experience material growth, we will need to attract and retain additional qualified personnel. The market for qualified and talented design and marketing personnel in the apparel industry is intensely competitive, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods. If we are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel as needed, our growth will be hampered and our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nLitigation exposure could exceed expectations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to regulatory inquiries, investigations, claims and suits, including, among others, consolidated shareholder derivative actions, wage and hour suits, and numerous employment related claims and suits. In addition, on or about June 23, 2014, Mr. Charney submitted a demand in arbitration against us in connection with his suspension, which had been stayed pending the determination of the Suitability Committee in the Internal Investigation. As a result of Mr. Charney's termination for cause, such stay is no longer in effect and we recently have received correspondence indicating that he intends to reinstate his demand for arbitration. Additionally, Mr. Charney may seek to file additional lawsuits against us arising from his termination for cause.\nIn the event that any current or future inquiries, investigations, claims or suits are decided against us, we may incur substantial liability, experience an increase in similar suits or suffer reputational harm. We are unable to predict the outcome that could result from these matters at this time and any views we form as to the viability of these claims or the financial exposure in which they could result could change from time to time as the matters proceed through their course or as facts are established. No assurance can be made that these matters will not result in material financial exposure, which together with the potential for similar suits and reputational harm, could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and results of operations. See \"Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8, Part II.\nIncreases in the number and magnitude of personal injury claims could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe face inherent business risk from exposure to personal injury or occupational claims and claims from outside parties resulting from our operations. Accidents at our manufacturing facilities have resulted, in some cases, in serious injuries and loss of life. For example, in the first quarter of 2015, an industrial accident at our dyeing facility in Hawthorne, California resulted in injuries to one of our employees. We could experience material personal injury or occupational claims and investigations arising from this accident and future accidents and we may incur significant costs to defend such claims and investigations.\nIf we fail to maintain the value and image of our brand, our sales are likely to decline.\nOur success depends on the value and image of our brand. Our name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brand depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality customer experience. Our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation or those of our senior personnel were to be tarnished by negative publicity. Any of these events, including the publicity surrounding the termination of Mr. Charney as our CEO, the results of the Internal Investigation and any litigation or regulatory investigations relating thereto, could adversely impact our image and result in decreases in sales.\nOur failure to adequately protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand and reduce demand for our merchandise.\nOur trademarks and service marks, and certain other intellectual property, have been registered, or are the subject of pending applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and with the registries of many foreign countries and/or are protected by common law. Our products are noted for their quality and fit, and our edgy, distinctive branding has differentiated us in the marketplace. As such, the trademark and variations thereon are valuable assets that are critical to our success. We intend to continue to vigorously protect our trademark and brand against infringement, but we may not be successful in doing so. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. The unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our trademark would diminish the value of our brand, which could reduce demand for our products or the prices at which we can sell our products.\nWe have substantial indebtedness, which could have adverse consequences to us, and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund our liquidity needs, including servicing our indebtedness.\nWe currently have substantial indebtedness. Our level of indebtedness has important consequences to us and to you and your investment. For example, our level of indebtedness may:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on debt, which would reduce the funds available to use for operations, investments, future business opportunities and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy debt obligations, and any failure to comply with such obligations, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default or an inability to borrow under the agreements governing such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nin the case of a default or an event of default, as applicable, lead to, among other things, cross-defaults with other indebtedness, an acceleration of indebtedness or foreclosure on the assets securing indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing or to sell assets or equity to raise funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans and other investments, which may limit our ability to implement business strategies;\n\u2022\nresult in higher interest expense if interest rates increase on our floating rate borrowings;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage relative to others in the industry, as it is not common for companies involved in the retail apparel business to operate with such high leverage;\n\u2022\nheighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the retail industry or in the general economy and limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business, the retail industry or in the general economy; or\n\u2022\nreduce our ability to carry out our plans to expand store base, product offerings and sales channels.\nOur ability to service indebtedness is dependent on cash from internal operations sufficient to make required payments on such indebtedness, which is, to a significant extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, some of which factors are further described in this \"Risk Factors\" section. We are permitted by the terms of our indebtedness, including our senior secured notes and the Capital One Credit Facility (as defined in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Part II), to incur additional indebtedness, subject to the restrictions therein. We have experienced negative cash flows from operating activities in the past, and our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to service indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. The inability to access sufficient liquidity could have a material adverse effect on us and we may need to take various actions, which also could have material adverse consequences to us, including seeking to refinance all or a portion of indebtedness, seeking additional debt or equity financing or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or investments, and we may not be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe terms of our indebtedness contain various covenants that may limit our business activities, and our failure to comply with these covenants could have material adverse consequences to us.\nThe terms of our indebtedness contain, and our future indebtedness may contain, various restrictive covenants that limit our management's discretion in operating our business. In particular, these agreements include, or may include, covenants relating to limitations on:\n\u2022\ndividends on, and redemptions and repurchases of capital stock;\n\u2022\npayments on subordinated debt;\n\u2022\nliens and sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nloans and investments;\n\u2022\ndebt and hedging arrangements;\n\u2022\nmergers, acquisitions and asset sales;\n\u2022\ntransactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ndisposals of assets;\n\u2022\nchanges in business activities conducted by us and our subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\ncapital expenditures, including to fund future store openings.\nWe have amended the Capital One Credit Facility from time to time in order to waive certain obligations relating to, among other things, financial ratio covenants including the third amendment dated November 14, 2013 and the fifth amendment dated March 25, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, we were not in compliance with the financial covenants under the Capital One Credit Facility. We obtained a waiver of such noncompliance in connection with the sixth amendment to the Capital One Credit Facility on March 25, 2015; however, there can be no assurance that we will maintain compliance therewith going forward and we may need to obtain further amendments to avoid an event of default under the facility.\nUnder the indenture governing our senior secured notes, a special interest trigger event occurred as of December 31, 2013 because our consolidated total net leverage ratio, as calculated under the indenture, exceeded 4.50 to 1.00. As a result, interest on the senior secured notes now accrues at a rate of 15% annum, with the interest in excess of 13% per annum payable in-kind for any interest payment date prior to April 15, 2018 and in cash for any interest payment date thereafter. The additional 2% per annum of interest accrues retroactively from the issue date of the senior secured notes. Similarly, because of the special interest trigger event, the interest rate on the Lion Loan Agreement (as defined in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Part II) also increased from 18% to 20% per annum with the additional 2% payable retroactively from the date of the loan agreement. On July 16, 2014, Lion assigned its rights and obligations as a lender under the Lion Loan Agreement to an entity affiliated with Standard General Group (\"Standard General\" and such agreement, subsequent to the assignment, the \"Standard General Loan Agreement\"). On September 8, 2014, we entered into an amendment of the Standard General Loan Agreement to lower the applicable interest rate to 17%, extend the maturity to April 15, 2021, and make certain other technical amendments, including to remove a provision that specified that Mr. Charney not being the CEO of the Company would constitute an event of default. Interest under the Standard General Loan Agreement is payable in cash or, to the extent permitted by our other debt agreements, in-kind. We are currently paying the interest in cash as the terms of our other debt agreements do not currently permit payment in-kind. On March 25, 2015, one of our subsidiaries borrowed $15,000 under an unsecured credit agreement with Standard General, dated as of March 25, 2015 (the \"Standard General Credit Agreement\"). The Standard General Credit Agreement is guaranteed by us, bears interest at 14% per annum, and will mature on October 15, 2020. The proceeds of such loan are intended to provide additional liquidity to us as contemplated by the Standstill and Support Agreement.\nOur credit agreements contain, and any future credit agreements or loan agreements may contain, certain financial and maintenance covenants, including covenants relating to our capital expenditures, fixed charge coverage, borrowing availability and leverage, some of which may be tied to consolidated EBITDA, in each case as defined in the applicable debt agreements. Such restrictive and other covenants could limit our ability to respond to market conditions, to provide for unanticipated capital requirements or to take advantage of business or acquisition opportunities.\nOur failure to comply with the various covenants under our indebtedness could have material adverse consequences to us. Such failure may result in our being unable to borrow under our revolving credit facility, which we utilize to access our working capital, and as a result may adversely affect our ability to finance our operations or pursue our expansion plans. Our debt agreements contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions by which non-compliance with covenants, or the acceleration of other indebtedness of at least a specified outstanding principal amount, could also constitute an event of default under such debt agreements. Accordingly, such a failure could result in the acceleration of all of our outstanding debt, and may adversely affect our ability to obtain financing that may be necessary to effectively operate our business and grow the business going forward. In addition, substantially all of our assets are used to secure indebtedness, including loans under our credit agreements, our senior secured notes and certain equipment leasing agreements. In the event of a default on these agreements, substantially all of our assets could be subject to liquidation by the creditors, which liquidation could result in no assets being left for the stockholders after the creditors receive their required payment. In such an event, we would be required to seek alternative sources of liquidity, and there can be no assurance that any alternative source of liquidity would be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nFluctuations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter could have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition and results of operations.\nWe experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues and operating income. Historically, sales during the third and fourth fiscal quarters have generally been the highest while sales during the first fiscal quarter have been the lowest. Any factors that harm our third or fourth quarter operating results, including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions, could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year.\nIn order to prepare for our peak selling season, we must produce and keep in stock more merchandise than we would carry at other times of the year. Any unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during our peak selling season could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown, which could reduce our net sales and gross profit.\nA variety of factors affect comparable store sales, including fashion trends, competition, current economic conditions, pricing, inflation, the timing of release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs, timing and level of markdowns and weather conditions. These factors may cause our comparable store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from our expectations.\nOur plans to expand our product offerings and sales channels might not be successful, and implementation of these plans might divert our operational, managerial and administrative resources, which could impact our competitive position.\nOur ability to grow our existing brand and develop or identify new growth opportunities depends in part on our ability to appropriately identify, develop and effectively execute strategies and initiatives. Failure to effectively identify, develop and execute strategies and initiatives may lead to increased operating costs without offsetting benefits and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. These plans involve various risks discussed elsewhere in these risk factors, including:\n\u2022\nimplementation of these plans may be delayed or may not be successful;\n\u2022\nif our expanded product offerings and sales channels fail to maintain and enhance our distinctive brand identity, our brand image may be diminished and our sales may decrease;\n\u2022\nimplementation of these plans may divert management's attention from other aspects of our business and place a strain on our management, operational and financial resources, as well as our information systems.\nIn addition, our ability to successfully carry out our plans to expand our product offerings may be affected by, among other things, economic and competitive conditions, changes in consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences, and fashion trends. Our expansion plans could be delayed or abandoned, could cost more than anticipated and could divert resources from other areas of our business, any of which could impact our competitive position and reduce our revenue and profitability.\nOur ability to attract customers to our stores depends heavily on the success of the shopping areas in which they are located.\nIn order to generate consumer traffic, we locate many of our stores in prominent locations within successful shopping areas. Net sales at these stores are partly dependent on the volume of traffic in those shopping areas. Our stores benefit from the ability of a shopping area's other tenants to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores and the continuing popularity of the shopping areas. We cannot control the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping areas, competition with other retailers for prominent locations or the success of individual shopping areas. Other factors beyond our control that impact consumer traffic include economic conditions nationally or in a particular area, severe weather, competition from internet\nretailers, changes in consumer demographics in a particular market, the closing or decline in popularity of other stores in the shopping areas where our stores are located, deterioration in the financial conditions of the operators of the shopping areas or developers and consumer spending levels. Furthermore, in pursuing our growth strategy, we will be competing with other retailers for prominent locations within the same successful shopping areas. If we are unable to secure prime store locations or unable to renew store leases on acceptable terms as they expire from time to time, we may not be able to continue to attract the number or quality of customers needed to sustain our projected revenues. All these factors may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business strategy relies in part on the opening of new stores, the remodeling of existing stores and expanding our business internationally, which may strain our resources, adversely impact the performance of our existing stores, and delay or prevent successful penetration into international markets.\nOur business strategy depends in part on opening new retail stores, both domestically and internationally, renewal of existing store leases on terms that meet our financial targets, remodeling existing stores in a timely manner, and cost-efficient operation of these stores. Successful implementation of this portion of our strategy depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, our ability to:\n\u2022\nidentify and obtain suitable store locations and negotiate acceptable leases for these locations;\n\u2022\ncomplete store design and remodeling projects on time and on budget;\n\u2022\nmanage and expand our infrastructure to accommodate growth;\n\u2022\ngenerate sufficient operating cash flows or secure adequate capital on commercially reasonable terms to fund expansion and remain in compliance with the relevant covenants in our credit facilities, which may limit our ability to fund such expansion;\n\u2022\nmanage inventory effectively to meet the needs of new and existing stores on a timely basis;\n\u2022\navoid construction delays and cost overruns in connection with the build-out of new stores;\n\u2022\nhire, train and retain qualified store managers and sales people.\n\u2022\ngain acceptance from foreign customers;\n\u2022\nmanage foreign exchange rate risks effectively;\n\u2022\naddress existing and changing legal, regulatory and political environments in target foreign markets; and\n\u2022\nmanage international growth, if any, in a manner that does not unduly strain our financial, operating and management resources.\nAny expansion of our store base and remodeling of existing stores may not result in an increase in our revenues even though they increase our costs. New stores may place increased demands on our existing financial, operational, managerial and administrative resources, which could cause us to operate less effectively. Further, our ability to fund expansion and other capital expenditures will depend on sufficient cash from internal operations (after taking into account our debt service obligations and subject to the covenants in debt agreements) or financing subject to general economic, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control and which financing may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nOur ability to obtain real estate to open new stores in desirable locations depends upon the availability of real estate that meets our criteria, which includes projected foot traffic, square footage, customer demographics and whether we are able to negotiate lease terms that meet our operating budget. In addition, we must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases from time to time. Failure to secure real estate in desirable locations on economically beneficial terms or to renew leases on existing store locations on economically beneficial terms could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe anticipate that we will incur significant costs related to starting up and maintaining additional foreign operations. Costs may include, and will not be limited to, setting up foreign offices and hiring experienced management. These increased demands may cause us to operate our business less effectively, which in turn could cause deterioration in the performance of our stores. In addition, our ability to conduct business in international markets may be affected by legal, regulatory, political and economic risks.\nSignificant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues, operating income, net income, earnings per share, and cash flows.\nWe face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations. These exposures may change over time, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore potentially less competitive in foreign markets. Lowering our price in local currency may result in lower revenue. Conversely, a decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase operating expenses.\nBecause we utilize foreign suppliers and sell into foreign markets, we are subject to numerous risks associated with international business that could increase our costs or disrupt the supply of our products, resulting in a negative impact on our business and financial condition.\nOur international operations subject us to risks, including:\n\u2022\neconomic and political instability;\n\u2022\nrestrictive actions by foreign governments;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nchanges in import duties or import or export restrictions;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect profit margins;\n\u2022\ntimely shipping of product;\n\u2022\ncomplications complying with the laws and policies of the United States affecting the exportation of goods, including duties, quotas, and taxes; and\n\u2022\ncomplications complying with trade and foreign tax laws.\nThese and other factors beyond our control could disrupt the supply of our products, influence the ability of our suppliers to export our products cost-effectively or at all, inhibit our suppliers' ability to procure certain materials and increase our expenses, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCost increases in, or shortages of, the materials or labor used to manufacture our products could negatively impact our business and financial condition.\nThe manufacture of our products is labor intensive and utilizes raw materials supplied by third parties. An important part of our branding and marketing is that our products are made in the U.S. The Federal Trade Commission has stated that for a product to be called \"Made in USA,\" or claimed to be of domestic origin without qualifications or limits on the claim, the product must be \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S. The term \"U.S.\" includes the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories and possessions. \"All or virtually all\" means that all significant parts and processing that go into the product must be of U.S. origin. That is, the product should contain no, or negligible, foreign content. We meet the Federal Trade Commission's \"Made in USA\" standard and from the knitting process to the final sewing of a garment, all of the processes are conducted in the U.S., either directly by us in our knitting, manufacturing, dyeing and finishing facilities located in Los Angeles or through commission knitters, dyers and sewers in the Los Angeles metropolitan area and other regions in the U.S. If the cost of labor materially increases, our financial results could be materially adversely affected and our ability to compete against companies with lower labor costs could be hampered. Material increases in labor costs in the U.S. could also force us to move all or a portion of our manufacturing overseas, which could adversely affect our brand identity.\nSimilarly, increases in the prices of raw materials or the prices we pay to the suppliers of the raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products, and shortages in such materials, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, the price of yarn and the cost of certain related fabrics has historically fluctuated. Such shortages may result in an increase in our manufacturing costs and could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and we are unable to predict whether we will be able to successfully pass on the added cost of raw materials to our wholesale and retail customers. In addition, increases in the cost of, or shortages in, our raw material inputs could adversely affect our ability to compete. Further, we could be forced to seek to offset any increased raw material costs by relocating all or a portion of our manufacturing overseas to locations with lower labor costs.\nOur manufacturing operations are located and will be located in higher-cost geographic locations, placing us at a possible disadvantage to competitors that have a higher percentage of their manufacturing operations overseas.\nDespite the general industry-wide migration of manufacturing operations to lower-cost locations, such as Central America, the Caribbean Basin and Asia, our textile manufacturing operations are still located in the U.S., which is a higher-cost location relative to these offshore locations. In addition, our competitors generally source or produce a greater portion of their textiles from foreign sources with lower costs than us. Our competitors' lower costs of production may allow them to offer their products at lower prices. This could force us to lower our margins or to compete more vigorously with non-price competitive strategies to preserve our margins and sales volume.\nOur reliance on operational facilities located in the same vicinity makes our business susceptible to local and regional disruptions or adverse conditions.\nWe conduct all of our manufacturing operations in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Among other facilities in the area, our 800,000 square foot facility in downtown Los Angeles houses executive offices as well as cutting and sewing operations. Our distribution operations are located in La Mirada, California. As a result of geographic concentration, our operations are susceptible to local and regional factors, such as accidents, system failures, economic and weather conditions, natural disasters, and demographic and population changes, and other unforeseen events and circumstances.\nSouthern California is particularly susceptible to earthquakes. Any significant interruption in the operation of any of these facilities could reduce our ability to receive and process orders and provide products and services to our stores and customers, which could result in lost sales, canceled sales and a loss of loyalty to our brand. In addition, if there were a major earthquake, we may have to cease operations for a significant period due to possible damage to our factory or inability to deliver products to our distribution center.\nUnionization of employees at our facilities could result in increased risk of work stoppages and high labor costs.\nOur employees are not party to any collective bargaining agreement or union. If employees at our manufacturing or distribution facilities were to unionize, our relationship with our employees could be adversely affected. We would also face an increased risk of work stoppages and higher labor costs. One non-union organization that purports to represent the rights of some of our current and former employees has communicated demands to us that are purportedly made on behalf of such current and former employees. We understand that one related group has solicited support with an intention to attempt to be recognized by us as a union. If employees at our manufacturing or distribution facilities were to unionize, or otherwise make collective demands on us, it could adversely affect our relationship with our employees, increase the risk of work stoppages and increase our labor costs and legal fees. Such employee actions could also have a material adverse impact on our operating costs and financial condition and could force us to take actions such as raising prices on our products, curtailing operations and/or relocating all or a portion of our operations overseas.\nA disruption in our information technology infrastructure may interrupt our operations.\nWe depend on information systems to operate our website, process transactions, respond to customer inquiries, manage inventory and production, purchase, sell and ship goods on a timely basis and maintain cost-efficient operations. We may experience operational problems with our information systems as a result of system failures, viruses, computer \"hackers\" or other causes.\nAny material disruption or slowdown of our systems could cause information, including data related to customer orders, to be lost or delayed, delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and customers or lost sales.\nMoreover, we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our customers and might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary investments in technology to compete with our competitors. Accordingly, if changes in technology cause our information systems to become obsolete, or if our information systems are inadequate to handle our growth, we could lose customers.\nA failure in our online retail operations could significantly disrupt our business and lead to reduced sales and reputational damage.\nOur online retail operations accounted for approximately 10% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 and are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operational results. Risks to online revenue include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer preferences and buying trends relating to internet usage;\n\u2022\nchanges in required technology interfaces;\n\u2022\nwebsite downtime;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in recreating the in-store experience on our website; and\n\u2022\nrisks related to the failure of the systems that operate the web sites and their related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of customer information, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions.\nOur failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce Internet sales and damage our brand's reputation.\nFailure to protect the integrity and security of our information systems and our customers\u2019 information could materially adversely affect our results of operations, damage our reputation and expose us to litigation.\nOur operations, including sales through our e-commerce website and retail stores, involve the collection, storage and transmission of customers' credit card information and personal identification data, as well as employee information and non-public company data. The costs associated with maintaining the security of such information, including increased investments in technology, the costs of compliance with consumer protection laws, and costs resulting from consumer fraud or a malicious breach of our information systems, could materially adversely affect our results of operations. If the security of the customer data stored on our servers or transmitted by our network is breached, our reputation could be materially adversely affected, which could negatively impact our sales results, and we could be subject to litigation. To date, we have not experienced a significant security breach.\nWe rely heavily on immigrant labor, and changes in immigration laws or enforcement actions or investigations under such laws could materially adversely affect our labor force, manufacturing capabilities, operations and financial results.\nWe rely heavily on immigrant labor. Adverse changes to existing laws and regulations applicable to employment of immigrants, enforcement requirements or practices under those laws and regulations, and inspections or investigations by immigration authorities or the prospects or rumors of any of the foregoing, even if no violations exist, could negatively impact the availability and cost of personnel and labor to us. As a result, we could experience very substantial turnover of employees on short or no notice, which could result in manufacturing and other delays. We may also have difficulty attracting or hiring new employees in a timely manner, resulting in further delays. These delays could materially adversely affect our revenues and costs and our ability to compete. If we are not able to continue to attract and retain sufficient employees, our manufacturing capabilities, operations and financial results would be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to customs, advertising, consumer protection, privacy, zoning and occupancy, and labor and employment laws that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs.\nWe are subject to numerous regulations, including customs, advertising, consumer protection and privacy, zoning and occupancy laws and ordinances that regulate the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise. If these regulations were to change or were violated, we could be subject to litigations, fines and penalties and experience increased costs of certain goods and delays in shipments of goods, which would hurt our business and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to numerous federal and state labor laws, such as minimum wage laws and other laws relating to employee benefits. If these laws were to change, we may incur additional wage and benefit costs, which could adversely affect our profitability. We are currently defending several wage and hour suits. Should these matters be decided against us, we could incur substantial liability, experience an increase in similar suits, and suffer reputational harm. We are unable to predict the financial outcome of these matters at this time, but no assurance can be made that these matters will not result in material financial exposure. See \"Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8, Part II for a more detailed discussion of our pending litigation.\nLegal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. We may be required to make significant expenditures or modify our business practices to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, which may increase our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business.\nWe are currently being audited by government tax agencies regarding our operating activities in previous periods which may result in an assessment of a material amount, the payment of which may adversely impact our financial conditions and operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we are being audited by government agencies in various jurisdictions in regards to sales, VAT, income, and other taxes and customs duties for certain previous years. For example, in connection with one such audit, the German customs audited the import records of our German subsidiary for the years 2009 through 2011 and issued retroactive punitive duty assessments on our imports. The German authorities demanded, and we paid, in connection with such assessments, $5,183 in 2014.\nAlthough we believe that we properly assess and remit all required sales, VAT, income, and other taxes and customs duties in applicable jurisdictions, no assurance can be made that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThird party failure to deliver merchandise to stores and customers could result in lost sales or reduced demand for our merchandise.\nThe efficient operation of our stores and wholesale business depends on the timely receipt of merchandise from our distribution centers. Independent third party transportation companies deliver a substantial portion of our merchandise to our stores. These shippers may not continue to ship our products at current pricing or terms. These shippers may employ personnel represented by labor unions. Disruptions in the delivery of merchandise or work stoppages by employees or contractors of these third parties could delay the timely receipt of merchandise, which could result in canceled sales, a loss of loyalty to our brand and excess inventory. There can be no assurance that such stoppages or disruptions will not occur in the future. Any failure by these third parties to respond adequately to our distribution needs would disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nTimely receipt of merchandise by our stores and our customers may also be affected by factors such as inclement weather, natural disasters and acts of terrorism. We may respond by increasing markdowns or initiating marketing promotions, which would decrease our gross profits and net income.\nWe have potential exposure to credit risks on our wholesale sales.\nWe are exposed to the risk of financial non-performance by our customers, primarily in our wholesale business. Sales to wholesale customers represented approximately 31% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our extension of credit involves considerable use of judgment and is based on an evaluation of each customer's financial condition and payment history. We monitor our credit risk exposure by periodically obtaining credit reports and updated financials of our customers. One customer in our U.S. wholesale business accounted for 16.6% of our total trade accounts receivable as of December 31, 2014. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential credit losses based upon historical trends and other available information. However, delays in collecting or the inability to collect on sales to significant customers or a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Company's Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nOur stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of quarter to quarter variations in our actual or anticipated financial results or the financial results of other companies in the retail and apparel industries. In addition, the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Failure to meet the expectations of investors, security analysts or credit rating agencies in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of our common stock and cause our credit ratings to decline. In addition, the fluctuation of our stock price also could cause us to fail to meet listing standards on the NYSE MKT if our stock price trades at a low price per share for a substantial period of time and we fail to effect a reverse split of our shares.\nIf we are unable to maintain the listing of our common stock on the NYSE MKT or any other securities exchange, it may be more difficult for you to sell your securities.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the NYSE MKT. We are currently in compliance with the continued listing standards of the NYSE MKT; however, in the past we have failed to meet such standards. We are subject to periodic review by NYSE MKT and no assurance can be given that we will continue to meet the listing requirements of NYSE MKT in the future. If for any reason the NYSE MKT should delist our common stock, and we are unable to obtain listing on another national securities exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u2022\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage;\n\u2022\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future; and\n\u2022\na determination that the common stock is a \"penny stock,\" if the securities sell for a substantial period of time at a low price per share which would require brokers trading in the common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for the common stock.\nVoting control by our directors, lenders and other affiliates, including Standard General and Dov Charney, may limit your ability to influence the outcome of director elections and other matters requiring stockholder approval.\nIn connection with the Standstill and Support Agreement, five directors resigned from the Board, effective as of August 2, 2014, and five new directors were appointed to the Board, three of whom were designated by Standard General and two of whom were appointed by the mutual agreement of Standard General and us. The Standstill and Support Agreement provides Standard General and Mr. Charney with specified rights with respect to the appointment of their mutually agreed designees to the Board and the nomination of such designees for election at our annual meeting of stockholders, subject to specified limitations, including that Mr. Charney will not serve as a member of our Board or be nominated by us or Standard General as a Board member. In 2014, Lion exercised its right to designate two members to our Board, whose appointments were effective as of September 15, 2014 and January 13, 2015, respectively. On March 6, 2015, a member appointed by Lion resigned from the Board, and, on March 24, 2015, the Board elected a member designated by Lion to fill that vacancy.\nAs of March 13, 2015, Mr. Charney owned approximately 42% of our outstanding common stock and Mr. Charney and Standard General collectively controlled the right to vote such common stock. On July 9, 2014, Mr. Charney and Standard General, on behalf of one or more of its funds, entered into a cooperation agreement (the \"Cooperation Agreement\"), which provides among other things that neither Mr. Charney nor Standard General will vote the common stock owned by Mr. Charney except in a manner approved by the parties in writing, except that, notwithstanding the terms of the Standstill and Support Agreement, Mr. Charney may vote certain of his shares in favor of his own election to the Board and may vote all of such shares pursuant to the Investment Voting Agreement (defined below). In addition, according to Mr. Charney's Schedule 13D/A, dated June 25, 2014, Mr. Charney agreed to enter into warrant agreements with Standard General that would give Standard General the right, exercisable on or prior to July 15, 2017, to purchase from Mr. Charney shares representing approximately 18.4% of our currently outstanding common stock (consisting of the 27,351,407 shares purchased by Mr. Charney from Standard General using the proceeds of a loan from Standard General and 10% of Mr. Charney\u2019s 47,209,407 original shares which original shares also are pledged as security for such loan, which shares are further referenced in the Cooperation Agreement).\nAs of March 13, 2015, Lion owned warrants to acquire 24.5 million shares, or approximately 14%, of our outstanding common stock. Mr. Charney and Lion have the right to acquire additional beneficial ownership under certain circumstances. In addition, Mr. Charney and Lion are parties to an investment agreement pursuant to which Lion has the right to designate up to two directors on the Board and a board observer (or, if we increase our board size to 12, up to three directors and no board observers), subject to maintaining certain minimum ownership thresholds of common stock or shares of common stock issuable under Lion's warrants.\nMr. Charney and Lion also are parties to an investment voting agreement, dated March 13, 2009 (the \"Investment Voting Agreement\") which provides that, for so long as Lion has the right to designate any person or persons to the Board, Mr. Charney will vote his shares of common stock in favor of Lion's designees, and Lion will vote its shares of common stock in favor of Mr. Charney and each other designee of Mr. Charney, in each case subject to Mr. Charney maintaining certain minimum ownership thresholds of common stock.\nThis concentration of share ownership, agreements allowing Standard General and Lion to appoint members to the Board, and voting agreements between Mr. Charney and Standard General and Mr. Charney and Lion, may adversely affect the trading price for the common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders. Also, some or all of our significant stockholders, if they were to act together, would be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of facilitating, delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us, or encouraging or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, depending on the desires of our significant stockholders. Among other things, such actions may prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the current market price for their shares of common stock. Our significant stockholders may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote their shares of common stock in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. Furthermore, Standard General and its affiliates could be our sole lender under our revolving credit facility if it acquires our revolving credit facility.\nOur adoption of a stockholders rights plan may delay or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nOn December 21, 2014, our Board adopted a stockholders rights plan (the \"Rights Plan\"). Under the Rights Plan, we declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of our common stock held by shareholders of record as of January 2, 2015. Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from us a unit consisting of one ten-thousandth of a share (a \"Unit\") of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at a purchase price of $3.25 per Unit, subject to adjustment. The Rights Plan was implemented by us to protect our stockholders from a threat of creeping control and provide the Board and our stockholders with adequate time to properly assess any take-over bid without undue pressure. However, the Rights Plan may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing acquisitions that would otherwise have provided value to our stockholders and may not be effective in preventing an acquirer from ultimately acquiring control over us.\nRisks Related to the Company's Industry\nWe operate in the highly competitive retail and apparel industries and our market share may be adversely impacted at any time by the significant number of competitors in our industries that may compete more effectively than we can.\nThe apparel industry is characterized by rapid shifts in fashion, consumer demand, and competitive pressures, resulting in both price and demand volatility. The retail apparel industry - specifically, the imprintable apparel market - is fragmented and highly competitive. Prices of certain products we manufacture are determined based on market conditions including the price of raw materials. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future.\nWe compete with national and local department stores, specialty and discount store chains, independent retail stores, and internet businesses that market similar lines of merchandise. Many of these competitors have greater name recognition and are better capitalized than us, which may enable them to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly, devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products, generate greater national brand recognition, or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can.\nWe also face competition in European, Asian and Canadian markets from established regional and national chains. Our success in these markets depends on determining a sustainable profit formula to build brand loyalty and gain market share in these challenging retail environments. If our international business is not successful, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe wholesale business competes with numerous wholesale companies based on the quality, fashion, availability, and price of wholesale product offerings. Many of these companies have greater name recognition and greater financial and other resources than us. If we cannot successfully compete with these companies, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nPurchases of retail apparel merchandise are generally discretionary and economic conditions may cause a decline in consumer spending which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending, particularly in discretionary areas such as fashion apparel. Our business and financial performance, including sales and the collection of accounts receivable, may be adversely affected by, among other things, any future decrease in economic activity in the markets we serve, increased unemployment levels, higher fuel and energy costs, rising interest rates, adverse conditions in the housing markets, financial market volatility, recession, decreased access to credit, reduced consumer confidence in future economic and political conditions, acts of terrorism, consumer perceptions of personal well-being and security, and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. A decrease in consumer discretionary spending as a result of macroeconomic conditions may decrease the demand for our products. In addition, reduced consumer spending may cause us to lower prices or drive us to offer additional products at promotional prices, any of which would have a negative impact on gross profit.\nOur ability to meet customers' demands depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials, parts and components from our suppliers. Global financial conditions may materially and adversely affect the ability of our suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations. If certain key suppliers were to become capacity constrained or insolvent as a result of a financial crisis, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies and adversely impact consumer purchases and our financial results. As a consequence, our operating results for a particular period are difficult to predict, and prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Any of the foregoing effects could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to gauge fashion trends and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner, our sales will decrease.\nOur success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the fashion tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand in a timely manner. The retail apparel business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences, which are dictated, in part, by fashion and season. To the extent we misjudge the market for our merchandise or the products suitable for our market, our sales will be adversely affected. Merchandise misjudgments could have a material adverse effect on our brand image.\nFluctuations in the apparel retail market affect the level of inventory owned by apparel retailers since merchandise must be manufactured in advance of the season and frequently before fashion trends are evidenced by customer purchases. In addition, the cyclical nature of the retail apparel business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to peak selling seasons when we build up our inventory levels. As a result, we will be vulnerable to demand pricing shifts, suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise production. If sales do not meet expectations, excess inventory may lower planned margins.\nElimination or scaling back of U.S. import protections would weaken an important barrier to the entry of foreign competitors who produce their merchandise in lower labor cost locations. This could place us at a disadvantage to those competitors.\nOur products are subject to foreign competition. Foreign competitors often have significant labor cost advantages, which can enable them to sell their products at relatively lower prices. However, foreign competitors have faced significant U.S. government import restrictions in the form of tariffs and quotas. The extent of import protection afforded to domestic apparel producers has been, and is likely to remain, subject to political considerations, and is therefore unpredictable. Given the number of foreign low cost producers, the substantial elimination or scaling back of the import protections that protect domestic apparel producers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nCurrent environmental laws, or laws enacted in the future, may harm our business.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances that govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects (such as emissions to air, discharges to water, and the generation, handling, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes). We are also subject to laws, regulations and ordinances that impose liability for the costs of clean up or other remediation of contaminated property, including damages from spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances or wastes, in certain circumstances without regard to fault. Certain of our operations routinely involve the handling of chemicals and wastes, some of which are or may become regulated as hazardous substances. Our product design and procurement operations must comply with new and future requirements relating to the materials composition of our products. If we fail to comply with the rules and regulations regarding the use and sale of such regulated substances, we could be subject to liability. The costs and timing of costs under environmental laws are difficult to predict.\nAs is the case with manufacturers in general, if a release of hazardous substances occurs on or from our properties or any associated offsite disposal locations, or if contamination from prior activities is discovered at any of our properties, we may be held liable. The amount of such liability could be material.", "PERMNO": 91136, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "APPCQ"}
