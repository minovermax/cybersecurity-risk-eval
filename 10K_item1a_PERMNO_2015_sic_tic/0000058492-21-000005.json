{"cik": "58492", "company": "LEGGETT & PLATT INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our securities involves risk. Set forth below and elsewhere in this report are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC.\nOPERATIONAL RISK FACTORS\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could further have, an adverse impact to (i) our manufacturing operations' ability to remain open, or fully operate, (ii) our ability to obtain necessary raw materials and parts, maintain appropriate labor levels, and ship finished products to customers; and (iii) our operating costs related to pay and benefits for terminated employees; all of which, in the aggregate, have had, and could further have, a material negative impact on our trade sales, earnings, liquidity, cash flow, financial condition, and our stock price.\nWe have manufacturing facilities in the United States and 16 other countries. All of these countries have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. All of our facilities are open and running at this time. From time to time we have some capacity restrictions on our plants due to governmental orders in various parts of the world. We have been and could be further negatively affected by governmental action in any one or more of the countries in which we operate by the imposition, or re-imposition, of restrictive measures concerning shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders, public gatherings and human interactions, mandatory closures of retail establishments that sell our products or our customers\u2019 products, travel restrictions, and restrictions on the import or export of products.\nThe U.S. and other governments have ordered that certain nonwoven fabrics used to produce ComfortCore\u00ae innersprings be prioritized to produce medical supplies, resulting in shortages of fabrics used for non-medical applications. These shortages and strong bedding demand have caused the Company temporarily to be unable to supply full industry demand for ComfortCore\u00ae. We are engaging with customers in an effort to work through these issues. The shortages have resulted in higher pricing for nonwoven fabrics. If we are unable to obtain the fabrics, cannot pass the cost along to our customers, are required to modify existing contracts to accommodate customers, or pay damage claims to customers, our results of operations may be negatively impacted. As demand has improved, we also have experienced some temporary labor shortages. We are in the process of hiring additional employees and adding equipment, particularly in our U.S. Spring business, to meet this demand.\nBecause of the shift of production by semiconductor microchip manufacturers to consumer electronics, such as laptops and tablets for home schooling and home offices, and away from automotive applications during the COVID-19 related automotive industry shutdowns in 2020, currently there is a shortage of microchips in the automotive industry. Our Automotive Group uses the microchips in seat comfort products, and to a lesser extent in motors and actuators. Although, to date, our Automotive Group has been able to obtain an adequate supply of microchips, we are dependent on our suppliers to deliver these microchips in accordance with our production schedule, and a shortage of the microchips can disrupt our operations and our ability to deliver products to our customers. Also, because of the industry shortage, automotive OEMs and other suppliers have not been able to secure an adequate supply of microchips, and as a result have reduced their production of automobiles or parts, which in turn has recently reduced, and may continue to reduce our sale of products. If we cannot secure an adequate supply of microchips in our supply chain, and the microchips cannot be sourced from a different supplier, or the automotive OEMs and other suppliers continue to reduce their production as a result of such shortage, this may negatively impact our sales, earnings, and financial condition.\nPART I\nDepending on the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the timing and effectiveness of any vaccines, our ability to keep our manufacturing operations open or fully operational, build and maintain appropriate labor levels, obtain necessary raw materials and parts, and ship finished products to customers may be partially or completely disrupted, either on a temporary or prolonged basis. The continued realization of these risks to our manufacturing operations, labor force, and supply chain could also increase labor, commodity, and energy costs.\nAlso, some facilities have experienced problems delivering products to customers because of travel restrictions and disruption in logistics necessary to import, export, or transfer products across borders. Currently, our supply chains have also been hampered by congested ports.\nWhen our employees have tested positive for COVID-19, we follow governmental orders and internally adopted procedures which include enhanced disinfecting that targets areas that have likely exposure to COVID-19. The employee is required to observe a quarantine period, monitor symptoms, and follow medical guidance prior to returning to work. Contact tracing is performed to identify any other employees who had direct contact with the employee who tested positive for COVID-19. If any direct contacts are identified, those employees must also self-isolate, monitor symptoms, and follow medical guidance prior to returning to work. A significant increase in COVID-19 cases among our employees may disrupt our ability to maintain necessary labor levels and produce and deliver products to our customers if we are unable to shift production to other manufacturing facilities.\nIn connection with reduced demand for our products in certain business units, we decreased the size of our workforce worldwide. We incurred severance costs of $7 million in 2020 and we do not expect any additional material charges. However, if circumstances change because of lack of demand, additional governmental capacity restrictions related to our facilities or otherwise, we may incur future material separation costs.\nBusiness disruptions to our steel rod mill, if coupled with an inability to purchase an adequate and/or timely supply of quality steel rod from alternative sources, could have a material negative impact on our Bedding Products segment and Company results of operations.\nWe purchase steel scrap from third party suppliers. This scrap is converted into steel rod in our mill in Sterling, Illinois. Our steel rod mill has historically had annual output of approximately 500,000 tons, a substantial majority of which has been used internally by our wire mills, which convert the steel rod into drawn steel wire. This wire is used in the production of many of our products, including mattress innersprings.\nA disruption to the operation of, or supply of steel scrap to, our steel rod mill could require us to purchase steel rod from alternative supply sources, subject to market availability. Ongoing trade action by the United States government, along with the existence of antidumping and countervailing duty orders against multiple countries, could result in reduced market availability and/or higher cost of steel rod.\nIf we experience a disruption to our ability to produce steel rod in our mill, coupled with a reduction of adequate and/or timely supply from alternative market sources of quality steel rod, we could experience a material negative impact on our Bedding Products segment and the Company's results of operations.\nFINANCIAL RISK FACTORS\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could further have, an adverse impact on the collection of trade and other notes receivables in accordance with their terms due to customer bankruptcy, financial difficulties, or insolvency.\nBankruptcy, financial difficulties, or insolvency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, or otherwise, can and has occurred with some of our customers which can impact their ability to pay their debts to us. As of December 31, 2020, we had a $25 million allowance for doubtful accounts ($23 million on a note receivable and $2 million on trade accounts receivable) associated with a customer in our Bedding Products segment who is experiencing financial difficulty and liquidity problems. This customer was placed on nonaccrual status in 2018 and became delinquent in quarterly interest payments in the first quarter of 2020.\nIn addition to the customer referenced above, many of our customers and other third parties have been adversely affected by the social and governmental restrictions and limitations related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, we\nPART I\nincreased our allowance for doubtful accounts by $20 million in the first quarter of 2020, including $9 million for the customer referenced above. We had modest activity for the remainder of 2020, and our bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $17 million. If these parties suffer significant financial difficulty, they may be unable to pay their debts to us, they may reject their contractual obligations to us under bankruptcy laws or otherwise, or we may have to negotiate significant discounts and/or extend financing terms with these parties. If we are unable to collect trade receivables and other notes receivables on a timely basis, this inability will require additional provisions for bad debt and result in a negative impact on our earnings, liquidity, cash flow and financial condition.\nOur goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to potential impairment which could negatively impact our earnings.\nA significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired. At December 31, 2020, goodwill and other intangible assets represented $2.1 billion, or 44% of our total assets. In addition, net property, plant, and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, and sundry assets totaled $1.1 billion, or 22% of total assets.\nWe review our reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in the second quarter as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing, and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists. In addition, we test for the recoverability of long-lived assets at year end, and more often if an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable. We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations.\nThe 2020 goodwill impairment testing resulted in a $25 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of 2020 with respect to our Hydraulic Cylinders reporting unit, which is a part of the Specialized Products segment. Demand for hydraulic cylinders is dependent upon capital spending for material handling equipment.\nThe impairment charge reflects the complete write-off of the goodwill associated with the Hydraulic Cylinders reporting unit and will not result in future cash expenditures. Although we do not believe that a triggering event related to the impairment of goodwill or other long-lived assets occurred in the first quarter of 2020, the anticipated longer-term economic impacts of COVID-19 lowered expectations of future revenue and profitability causing its fair value to fall below its carrying value. We concluded on July 30, 2020, as part of our normal second quarter 2020 annual goodwill impairment testing and in connection with the preparation and review of the second quarter 2020 financial statements, that an impairment charge was required with respect to this reporting unit. We also evaluated other long-lived assets associated with this unit for impairment; no impairments were indicated other than goodwill.\nOf the remaining six reporting units, three had fair values in excess of carrying value of less than 100%.\n\u2022 Fair value for our Bedding reporting unit exceeded carrying value by 68%. Our 2019 acquisition of ECS is part of our Bedding reporting unit, and goodwill for our Bedding reporting unit was $857 million at December 31, 2020.\n\u2022 Fair value for our Aerospace reporting unit exceeded carrying value by 51%. Goodwill for the Aerospace reporting unit was $59 million at December 31, 2020.\n\u2022 Fair value for our Work Furniture reporting unit exceeded carrying value by 25%. Goodwill for the Work Furniture reporting unit was $97 million at December 31, 2020.\nIf there is a prolonged adverse economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, or otherwise, we may not be able to achieve projected performance levels. Although we do not believe that a triggering event has occurred, internal forecasts and industry data suggest that economic impacts of COVID-19 for the aerospace industry may be longer than previously expected during the second quarter impairment testing. We are continuing to monitor all factors impacting this industry. If actual results materially differ from the assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and long-lived asset valuation calculations, we could incur future impairment charges. These non-cash charges could have a material negative impact on our earnings.\nFor more information regarding potential goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment, please refer to Note C on page 90 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPART I\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact to our ability to access the commercial paper market, and has had, and could further have, an adverse impact on our ability to borrow under our credit facility, including our ability to comply with the restrictive covenants in our credit facility.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on our liquidity. Our inability to issue commercial paper in appropriate amounts and tenor, for cash management purposes, could cause us to borrow under our revolving credit facility which serves as support for our commercial paper program. If this were to happen, we would incur higher interest costs.\nThe credit facility is a multi-currency facility maturing in January 2024, providing us the ability, from time to time subject to certain restrictive covenants and customary conditions, to borrow, repay, and re-borrow up to $1.2 billion. The credit facility also provided for a one-time draw of up to $500 million under a five-year term loan facility, which we fully borrowed in January 2019 to consummate the ECS acquisition.\nBecause of the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, effective May 6, 2020, we amended the credit facility to, among other things, change the restrictive borrowing covenants. The prior leverage ratio covenant required us to maintain, as of the last day of each quarter, a leverage ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to trailing 12-month consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the credit facility) of not greater than 3.50 to 1.00. The leverage ratio covenant was changed in two ways: (i) the calculation of the ratio now subtracts unrestricted cash (as defined in the credit facility) from consolidated funded indebtedness; and (ii) the ratio levels, calculated as of the last day of the applicable fiscal quarter, were changed to 4.75 to 1.00 for each fiscal quarter end date through March 31, 2021; 4.25 to 1.00 at June 30, 2021; 3.75 to 1.00 at September 30, 2021; and 3.25 to 1.00 at December 31, 2021 and thereafter. In addition, the amount of total secured debt limit was changed from 15% to 5% of our total consolidated assets until December 31, 2021, at which time it will revert back to 15%. Various interest rate terms were also changed. The impact on our interest expense will depend upon our ability to access the commercial paper market, and if so, the degree of that access. The credit facility also contains an anti-cash hoarding provision that limits borrowing if the Company has a consolidated cash balance (as defined in the credit facility) in excess of $300 million without planned expenditures.\nIf our earnings are reduced because of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, the covenants in the credit facility will reduce our borrowing capacity, both under the credit facility or through commercial paper issuances. Depending on the degree of earnings reduction, our liquidity could be materially negatively impacted. This covenant may also restrict our current and future operations, including (i) our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our businesses and industries; and (ii) our ability to use our cash flows, or obtain additional financing, for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes.\nAlso, if we fail to comply with the covenants specified in the credit facility, we may trigger an event of default, in which case the lenders would have the right to: (i) terminate their commitment to provide additional loans under the credit facility; and (ii) declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. Additionally, our senior notes contain cross-default provisions which could make outstanding amounts under the senior notes immediately payable in the event of an acceleration of amounts due under the credit facility following a material uncured default. If debt under the credit facility or senior notes were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash to repay this debt, which would have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet depending upon the amount and source of future taxable income.\nOur ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income. As of December 31, 2020, we had $134 million of deferred tax assets ($152 million less an $18 million valuation allowance). After netting of deferred tax liabilities, the net amount presented within Sundry assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets is $11 million. It is possible the amount and source of our taxable income could materially change in the future. Particularly, our mix of earnings by taxing jurisdiction may materially change in that we may have more or less taxable income generated in North America, Europe, or Asia as compared to prior years. This change may impact our underlying assumptions on which valuation allowances are established and negatively affect future period earnings and balance sheets. As a result, we may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet.\nPART I\nMARKET RISK FACTORS\nCosts of raw materials could negatively affect our profit margins and earnings.\nRaw material cost increases (and our ability to respond to cost increases through selling price increases) can significantly impact our earnings. We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; accordingly, our raw material costs generally move with the market. When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs. Inability to recover cost increases (or a delay in the recovery time) can negatively impact our earnings. Conversely, if raw material costs decrease, we generally pass through reduced selling prices to our customers. Reduced selling prices combined with higher cost inventory can reduce our profit margins and earnings.\nSteel is our principal raw material. The global steel markets are cyclical in nature and have been volatile in recent years. This volatility can result in large swings in pricing and margins from year to year.\nAs a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by volatility in metal margins (the difference between the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod). If market conditions cause scrap costs and rod pricing to change at different rates (both in terms of timing and amount), metal margins could be compressed, and this would negatively impact our results of operations.\nWith the acquisition of ECS, we now have greater exposure to the cost of chemicals, including TDI, MDI, and polyol. We have experienced a shortage of chemicals, and these shortages have resulted in higher pricing. Chemical shortages are expected to continue at least through mid-2021. If we are unable to obtain an adequate supply of chemicals, or cannot purchase them at economically feasible prices and pass the additional cost along to our customers, either the shortages or increased costs may negatively impact our results of operations.\nHigher raw material costs could lead some of our customers to modify their product designs, changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods and replacing higher-cost components with lower-cost components. If this were to occur, it could negatively impact our results of operations.\nUnfair competition could adversely affect our market share, sales, profit margins, and earnings.\nWe produce innersprings for mattresses that are sold to bedding manufacturers. We produce steel wire rod for consumption by our wire mills (primarily to produce innersprings) and to sell to third parties. We also produce and sell finished mattresses.\nSince 2009, there have been antidumping duties on the import of innersprings from China, South Africa, and Vietnam imposed by the Department of Commerce (DOC) and International Trade Commission (ITC) extending through 2024. The DOC and ITC have also imposed antidumping duties and countervailing duties on imports of steel wire rod from various countries, including China. These duties will expire, unless extended, at different times ranging from 2022 to 2025. Also, antidumping duties have been imposed by the DOC and ITC on the import of finished mattresses from China through 2024, and additional preliminary antidumping duties are in place on import of finished mattresses from Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Serbia, Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam, and preliminary countervailing duties on China. If the existing antidumping and countervailing duties are not finalized or extended beyond their current terms and dumping and/or subsidization recurs, or manufacturers in the subject countries circumvent the existing duties through transshipment in other jurisdictions or otherwise, our market share, sales, profit margins, and earnings could be adversely affected.\nOur borrowing costs and access to liquidity may be impacted by our credit ratings.\nIndependent rating agencies evaluate our credit profile on an ongoing basis and have assigned ratings for our long-term and short-term debt. In April 2020, one of three rating agencies, which had our long-term debt rating on negative outlook, lowered that rating by one notch, but changed the outlook to stable. In May 2020, a second rating agency lowered our long-term and short-term ratings by one notch with a stable outlook. In August 2020, we obtained ratings on our long-term and short-term debt from a third rating agency. If we are not able to access the commercial paper market, either partially or completely, we expect to borrow under our credit facility for our liquidity needs but at higher interest costs. Because of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our credit ratings could decline further. If this were to occur,\nPART I\nour borrowing costs could increase materially, and our access to sources of liquidity, including the commercial paper market, may be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk which may negatively impact our competitiveness, profit margins, and earnings.\nInternational sales have represented a significant percentage of our total sales, which exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations. In 2020, 34% of our sales were generated by international operations, primarily in Europe, China, Canada, and Mexico. We expect that a significant amount of our sales will continue to come from outside the United States in the future. Nearly 50 of our manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. We are also exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations by our purchase of raw materials and component parts from suppliers in multiple countries. We experience currency-related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. As of December 31, 2020, we had foreign exchange rate risk associated with the U.S. Dollar, Mexican Peso, Danish Krone, Euro, South African Rand, Canadian Dollar, Swiss Franc, Chinese Yuan, British Pound Sterling, and the Polish Zloty. If these exchange rates devalue the currency we receive for the sale of our products, or the currency we use to purchase raw materials or component parts from our suppliers, it may have a material adverse effect on our competitiveness, profit margins, and earnings.\nFor more information regarding currency exchange rate risk, please refer to Note S on page 127 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could further have, an adverse impact to the market demand for our products and our customers\u2019 products, growth rates in the industries in which we participate, and opportunities in those industries.\nBecause of the COVID-19 pandemic various governments, primarily impacting us in Asia, Europe and North America, and elsewhere have instituted, and may reinstitute quarantines, shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders, or restrictions on public gatherings as well as limitations on social interactions. These restrictions and limitations have had, and could further have, an adverse effect on the economies and financial markets of the countries where our products, or our customers\u2019 products, are sold. The resulting economic downturn has had, and could further have, an effect on the market demand for our products and our customers\u2019 products, growth rates in the industries in which we participate, and opportunities in those industries. As a result of the decreased market demand, our trade sales, earnings, liquidity, cash flow, and financial condition have been and could be further materially negatively affected.\nTECHNOLOGY AND CYBERSECURITY RISK FACTORS\nTechnology failures or cybersecurity breaches could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nAs a manufacturer with 132 production facilities in 17 different countries, primarily in Asia, Europe, North America, and elsewhere, we rely on several on-premise and cloud-based computerized systems and networks to obtain, secure, process, analyze, and manage data, as well as to facilitate the manufacture and distribution of inventory to and from our production facilities. We receive, process, manufacture, and ship orders, manage the billing of and collections from our customers, and manage the accounting for and payment to our vendors. We also have risk associated with the network connectivity and systems for consolidated reporting. Technology failures or security breaches of a new or existing infrastructure could impede normal operations, create system disruptions, or create unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.\nWe have a formal process in place for both incident response and cybersecurity continuous improvement that includes a cross functional Cybersecurity Oversight Committee. Members of the Cybersecurity Oversight Committee update the Board of Directors quarterly on cyber activity, with procedures in place for interim reporting if necessary.\nAlthough we have not experienced any material technology failures or cybersecurity breaches, we have enhanced our cybersecurity protection efforts over the last few years. We use a third party to periodically benchmark our information security program against the National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s Cybersecurity Framework. We provide quarterly cybersecurity training for employees with access to our email and data systems, and we have purchased broad\nPART I\nform cyber insurance coverage. However, because of the risk due to the COVID-19 pandemic regarding increased remote access, remote work conditions, and associated strain on employees, technology failures or cybersecurity breaches could still create system disruptions or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. We cannot be certain that the attacker\u2019s capabilities will not compromise our technology protecting information systems. We could still experience material technology failures or cybersecurity breaches. If this occurs, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer financial loss because of lost or misappropriated information. Also, we may incur remediation costs, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information, litigation and legal costs, reputational damages, proprietary and confidentiality impacts, damage to our competitiveness, and negative impact on our stock price and long-term shareholder value. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities will not compromise our technology protecting information systems. If these systems are interrupted or damaged by these events or fail for any extended period of time, then our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTRADE RISK FACTORS\nTariffs by the United States government could result in materially lower margins, lost sales, and an overall adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWhile we frequently manufacture products where our customers are located, we do, in some cases, import and export various raw materials, components, or finished goods across several business units, including the Automotive and Bedding groups and the Machinery business. The United States has imposed broad-ranging tariffs on steel and aluminum (each of which we use in our manufacturing processes), a wide assortment of Chinese-made products, and other products on a country-specific basis. In retaliation, many other countries have imposed counter-tariffs on US-produced items. If we are unable to pass through additional costs created by these tariffs, it could result in materially lower margins, lost sales, and an overall adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union could adversely affect us.\nIn June 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (EU), commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d In January 2020, the Withdrawal Agreement Act was passed by the UK Parliament and the Brexit deal was ratified by the EU Parliament. This allowed the UK to formally leave the EU on January 31, 2020, with a transition period through December 31, 2020, while the EU and UK were to negotiate a trade agreement, among other things. Additional negotiations among the EU and UK continue, as well as negotiations of trade agreements between the UK and other countries, including the United States. Because we have multiple manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom, EU, and other countries, and these facilities purchase raw materials and component parts from suppliers in those countries, and sell products into the United Kingdom, EU, and elsewhere, the results of Brexit could cause disruptions and create uncertainty to our supply chain and distribution networks, tariff rates, and currencies, and could fluctuate the value of the British Pound and the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar and other currencies. These disruptions and uncertainties could increase our costs and adversely affect us.\nREGULATORY RISK FACTORS\nPrivacy and data protection regulations are complex and could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nGovernments around the world have adopted legislative and regulatory proposals concerning the collection and use of personal data of consumers, employees, and business contacts. As a company with primarily employee and business contact personal data, we are subject to many different data protection laws, including some U.S. states such as California and countries in Europe, China, and Brazil. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to our operations that collect or process personal information of EU individuals, such as personal information concerning our employees at our facilities in Croatia and Poland. If our EU operations are found to violate GDPR requirements, we may incur substantial fines, need to change our business practices, and face reputational harm, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. As a U.S. company, the ability to centrally manage aspects of our operation and workforce, and to make decisions based on complete and accurate global data, is important and requires the ability to transfer and access data. In order to enable the transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S., we have self-certified to the U.S.\nPART I\nDepartment of Commerce and committed to comply with specified requirements under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework.\nIn July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield is an invalid transfer mechanism, but upheld Standard Contractual Clauses, which we also use, as a valid transfer mechanism under appropriate circumstances. The validity of data transfer mechanisms remains subject to legal, regulatory, and political developments in both Europe and the U.S. The invalidation of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and potential invalidation of other data transfer mechanisms could have an adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the EU. This may inhibit our ability to transfer our employee data from our European operations to the Company\u2019s headquarters in the U.S., or elsewhere, making it much more difficult to effectively manage our global human capital. These evolving privacy and data protection requirements create uncertainty and added compliance obligations that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nClimate change laws and related regulations could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition, and competitive position.\nWe have 132 production facilities world-wide. Some of our facilities are engaged in manufacturing processes that produce greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide. We also maintain a fleet of over-the-road tractor trailers that emit greenhouse gases. Climate change has received increased attention worldwide. Many scientists, legislators, and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit such emissions. Although we have adopted an environmental sustainability program that encourages employees to carry out efforts, in part, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, either the enactment of, or change to existing laws and regulations, could mandate more restrictive standards or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. Our manufacturing facilities are primarily located in North America, Europe and Asia. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation in the jurisdictions where we operate, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. To the extent our customers are subject to any of these or other similar proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations, additional costs by customers to comply with such laws and regulations could impact their ability to operate at similar levels in certain jurisdictions, which could adversely impact their demand for our products and services. Also, if these laws or regulations impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements on us, they could increase costs associated with our operations, including costs for raw materials and transportation. In either event, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition, and competitive position.\nIncreased scrutiny from investors, lenders, and other market participants regarding our environmental, social and governance, or sustainability, responsibilities could expose us to additional costs or risks and adversely impact our liquidity, results of operations, reputation, employee retention, and stock price.\nInvestor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, lenders and other market participants, shareholders, and customers have focused increasingly on the environmental, social and governance (ESG) or \u201csustainability\u201d practices of companies. These parties have placed increased importance on the implications of the social cost of their investments. If our ESG practices do not meet investor, lender, or other industry stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our access to capital may be negatively impacted based on an assessment of our ESG practices. These limitations, in both the debt and equity markets, may materially negatively affect our ability to manage our liquidity, our ability to refinance existing debt, grow our businesses, implement our strategies, our results of operations, and the price of our common stock.\nWe are currently preparing and expect to publish our first sustainability report in 2021, which will detail how we seek to manage our operations responsibly and ethically. The sustainability report is expected to include our policies and practices on a variety of social and ethical matters, including, but not limited to, corporate governance, environmental compliance, employee health and safety practices, human capital management, product quality, supply chain management, and workforce inclusion and diversity. It is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of their adoption. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various ESG practices. Also, our failure, or perceived failure, to meet the standards set forth in the sustainability report could negatively impact our reputation, employee retention, and the willingness of our customers and suppliers to do business with us.\nPART I\nChanges in tax laws or challenges to our tax positions pursuant to ongoing tax audits could negatively impact our earnings and cash flows.\nWe are subject to the tax laws and reporting rules of the U.S. (federal, state, and local) and several foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make these tax rules (and governmental interpretation of these rules) in any jurisdiction, including the U.S., subject to significant change and uncertainty. There have been proposals, most notably by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, to reform tax laws or change interpretations of existing tax rules. These proposals, if adopted, could significantly impact how our earnings and transactions are taxed as a multinational corporation. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will become law, or how they might be interpreted, such changes could impact our assumptions related to the taxation of certain foreign earnings and have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows.\nWe are currently in various stages of audit by the U.S. and foreign governmental taxing authorities. We have established liabilities as we believe are appropriate, with such amounts representing what we believe is a reasonable provision for taxes that we ultimately might be required to pay. However, these liabilities could be increased over time as more information becomes known relative to the resolution of these audits, as either certain governmental tax positions may be sustained on audit or we may agree to certain tax adjustments. We could incur additional tax expense if we have adjustments higher than the liabilities recorded.\nLITIGATION RISK FACTORS\nWe are exposed to litigation contingencies that, if realized, could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAlthough we deny liability in all currently threatened or pending litigation proceedings and believe that we have valid bases to contest all claims made against us, we have recorded an immaterial aggregate litigation contingency accrual at December 31, 2020. Based on current facts and circumstances, aggregate reasonably possible (but not probable) losses in excess of the recorded accruals for litigation contingencies (which include Brazilian value-added tax and other matters) are estimated to be $12 million. If our assumptions or analyses regarding any of our contingencies are incorrect, or if facts and circumstances change, we could realize loss in excess of the recorded accruals (and in excess of the $12 million referenced above) which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. For more information regarding our legal contingencies, please see Note T on page 130 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.", "PERMNO": 60943, "SIC": 2510, "TIC": "LEG"}
