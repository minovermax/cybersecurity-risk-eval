RISK FACTORS\nYou\nshould carefully consider the following risk\nfactors in addition to the other information\nincluded in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nThese risk factors are not the only risks\nwe face.\nOur business could also be\naffected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently\nknown to us or that we currently consider to be\nimmaterial.\nIf any of these risks or other risks that are yet unknown\nwere to occur, our business, operating\nresults and financial condition, as well as the\nvalue of an investment in our common stock\ncould be adversely\naffected.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe have been negatively affected and may continue to be negatively affected by the prolonged drop in\ncommodity prices that began in early 2020.\nThe oil and gas business is fundamentally a commodity\nbusiness and our revenues, operating results\nand future\nrate of growth are highly dependent on the prices\nwe receive for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas,\nNGLs and\nLNG.\nSuch prices can fluctuate widely depending upon\nglobal events or conditions that affect supply and\ndemand, most of which are out of our control.\nSince early 2020, there has been a precipitous\ndecrease in\ndemand for oil globally, largely caused by the dramatic decrease in travel and commerce\nresulting from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\nSee Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof Operations, for additional information\non commodity prices and how we have been\nimpacted.\nThere is no\nassurance of when or if commodity prices will\nreturn to pre-COVID-19 levels,\nand if they do return to pre-\nCOVID levels, how long they will remain at those\nlevels.\nThe speed and extent of any recovery remains\nuncertain and is subject to various risk factors,\nincluding the duration, impact and actions taken\nto stem the\nproliferation of the COVID-19 pandemic, the extent\nto which those nations party to the OPEC\nplus production\nagreement decide to increase production of crude\noil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs and other factors\ndescribed herein.\nEven after a recovery, our industry will continue to be exposed to the\neffects of changing\ncommodity prices given the volatility\nin commodity price drivers and the worldwide political\nand economic\nenvironment generally, as well as continued uncertainty caused by armed hostilities\nin various oil-producing\nregions around the globe.\nLower crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, NGL and\nLNG prices may have a material adverse effect on our\nrevenues, earnings, cash flows and liquidity, and may also affect the amount of dividends\nwe elect to declare\nand pay on our common stock.\nAs a result of the oil market downturn that\nbegan in early 2020, we suspended\nour share repurchase program.\nLower prices may also limit the amount of reserves\nwe can produce\neconomically, thus adversely affecting our proved reserves and reserve replacement ratio\nand accelerating the\nreduction in our existing reserve levels as we continue\nproduction from upstream fields.\nProlonged depressed\ncrude oil prices may affect certain decisions related to\nour operations, including decisions to reduce\ncapital\ninvestments or curtail operated production.\nSignificant reductions in crude oil, bitumen, natural\ngas, NGLs and LNG prices could also\nrequire us to reduce\nour capital expenditures, impair the carrying value\nof our assets or discontinue the classification\nof certain\nassets as proved reserves.\nIn 2020, we recognized several impairments,\nwhich are described in Note 7-\nSuspended Wells and Exploration Expenses and Note 8-Impairments, in the Notes\nto Consolidated Financial\nStatements,\ndue to changes in assumptions for commodity\nprices and development plans.\nIf the outlook for\ncommodity prices remains low relative to historic\nlevels, and as we continue to optimize our investments\nand\nexercise capital flexibility, it is reasonably likely we will incur future impairments\nto long-lived assets used in\noperations, investments in nonconsolidated entities\naccounted for under the equity method and unproved\nproperties.\nIf oil and gas prices persist at depressed levels,\nour reserve estimates may decrease further, which\ncould incrementally increase the rate used to determine\nDD&A expense on our unit-of-production method\nproperties.\nSee Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis for further examination\nof DD&A rate impacts\nversus comparative periods.\nAlthough it is not reasonably practicable to quantify\nthe impact of any future\nimpairments or estimated change to our unit-of-production\nrates at this time, our results of operations could\nbe\nadversely affected as a result.\nOur business has been, and will continue to\nbe, adversely affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19)\npandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures put\nin place to address it have negatively impacted\nthe global\neconomy, disrupted global supply chains, reduced global demand for oil\nand gas, and created significant\nvolatility and disruption of financial and commodity\nmarkets.\nAccording to the National Bureau of Economic\nResearch, as a result of the pandemic and its broad\nreach across the entire economy, the U.S. entered a\nrecession in early 2020 and the timing, pace and extent\nof the recovery is still unknown.\nPublic health officials\nhave recommended or mandated certain precautions\nto mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including limiting\nnon-essential gatherings of people, ceasing all\nnon-essential travel and issuing \u201csocial or\nphysical distancing\u201d\nguidelines, \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders and mandatory\nclosures or reductions in capacity for non-essential\nbusinesses.\nAlthough some of these limitations and mandates\nhave been relaxed in certain jurisdictions,\nothers\nhave been reinstated in areas that have experienced\na resurgence of COVID-19 cases.\nIn addition, despite\napproval of vaccines to immunize against\nCOVID-19, the speed at which such vaccinations\nwill be available to\nthe public,\nthe public\u2019s willingness to be inoculated and the effectiveness of the vaccine\n(including to variants)\nstill remain unknown.\nAs a result, the full impact of the COVID-19\npandemic remains uncertain and will\ndepend on the severity, location and duration of the effects and spread of the disease,\nthe effectiveness and\nduration of actions taken by authorities to contain\nthe virus or treat its effect, the availability and effectiveness\nof vaccines or other treatments, and how quickly\nand to what extent economic conditions improve.\nWe have already been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSee Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations, for additional information on how we have\nbeen\nimpacted and the steps we have taken in response.\nOur business is likely to continue to be further\nnegatively impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic.\nThese\nimpacts could include but are not limited\nto:\n\u25cf\nContinued reduced demand\nfor our products as a result of prolonged reductions\nin travel and\ncommerce,\neven if restrictions are lifted;\n\u25cf\nDisruptions in our supply chain due in part to scrutiny\nor embargoing of shipments from infected areas\nor invocation of force majeure clauses in commercial\ncontracts due to restrictions imposed as a result\nof the global response to the pandemic;\n\u25cf\nFailure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, contract\nmanufacturers, contractors,\njoint venture partners and external business partners,\nto meet their obligations to the company, or\nsignificant disruptions in their ability to\ndo so, which may be caused by their own financial\nor\noperational difficulties or restrictions imposed in\nresponse to the disease outbreak;\n\u25cf\nReduced workforce productivity caused by, but not limited to, illness, travel\nrestrictions, quarantine,\nor government mandates;\n\u25cf\nBusiness interruptions resulting from a portion\nof our workforce continuing to telecommute,\nas well as\nthe implementation and maintenance of protections\nfor employees commuting for work, such as\npersonnel screenings and self-quarantines before or\nafter travel; and\n\u25cf\nVoluntary\nor involuntary curtailments to support oil prices\nor alleviate storage shortages for our\nproducts.\nAny of these factors, or other cascading effects of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable,\ncould materially increase our costs, negatively impact\nour revenues and damage our financial condition,\nresults\nof operations, cash flows and liquidity position.\nDespite the rollout of vaccines, the pandemic\ncontinues to\nprogress and evolve, and the full extent and duration\nof any such impacts cannot be predicted\nat this time\nbecause of the sweeping impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\non daily life around the world and a lack of\ncertainty as to if or when conditions will return\nto pre-COVID levels.\nUnless we successfully add to our existing proved\nreserves, our future crude oil, bitumen,\nnatural gas and\nNGL production will decline, resulting in an\nadverse impact to our business.\nThe rate of production from upstream fields\ngenerally declines as reserves are depleted.\nIf we do not conduct\nsuccessful exploration and development activities,\nor, through engineering studies, optimize production\nperformance or identify additional or secondary\nrecovery reserves, our proved reserves\nwill decline materially\nas we produce crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and\nNGLs, and our business will experience reduced cash\nflows\nand results of operations.\nAny cash conservation efforts we may undertake as a result\nof commodity price\ndeclines may further limit our ability to replace\ndepleted reserves.\nThe exploration and production of oil and gas\nis a highly competitive industry.\nThe exploration and production of crude oil,\nbitumen, natural gas and NGLs is a highly\ncompetitive business.\nWe compete with private, public and state-owned companies in all facets of the\nexploration and production\nbusiness, including to locate and obtain new\nsources of supply and to produce crude oil,\nbitumen, natural gas\nand NGLs in an efficient, cost-effective manner.\nSome of our competitors are larger and have greater\nresources than we do or may be willing to incur a\nhigher level of risk than we are willing to\nincur to obtain\npotential sources of supply.\nIn addition, we may be at a competitive disadvantage\nwhen competing with state-\nowned companies if they are motivated by political\nor other factors in making their business decisions,\nwith\nless emphasis on financial returns.\nIf we are not successful in our competition for\nnew reserves, our financial\ncondition and results of operations may be adversely\naffected.\nAny material change in the factors and assumptions\nunderlying our estimates of crude oil, bitumen,\nnatural\ngas and NGL reserves could impair the quantity\nand value of those reserves.\nOur proved reserve information included in this annual\nreport represents management\u2019s best estimates based\non assumptions, as of a specified date, of the volumes\nto be recovered from underground accumulations of\ncrude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs.\nSuch volumes cannot be directly measured\nand the estimates and\nunderlying assumptions used by management are\nsubject to substantial risk and uncertainty.\nAny material\nchanges in the factors and assumptions underlying\nour estimates of these items could result\nin a material\nnegative impact to the volume of reserves reported\nor could cause us to incur impairment expenses\non property\nassociated with the production of those reserves.\nFuture reserve revisions could also result\nfrom changes in,\namong other things, governmental regulation.\nOur business may be adversely affected by price controls,\ngovernment-imposed limitations on production\nof\ncrude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs, or the\nunavailability of adequate gathering, processing,\ncompression, transportation, and pipeline\nfacilities and equipment for our production\nof crude oil, bitumen,\nnatural gas and NGLs.\nAs discussed herein, our operations are subject\nto extensive governmental regulations.\nFrom time to time,\nregulatory agencies have imposed price controls\nand limitations on production by restricting\nthe rate of flow of\ncrude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGL wells\nbelow actual production capacity.\nBecause legal requirements\nare frequently changed and subject to interpretation,\nwe cannot predict whether future restrictions\non our\nbusiness may be enacted or become applicable to\nus.\nOur ability to sell and deliver the crude oil, bitumen,\nnatural gas, NGLs and LNG that we produce\nalso\ndepends on the availability, proximity, and capacity of gathering, processing, compression, transportation\nand\npipeline facilities and equipment, as well as any necessary\ndiluents to prepare our crude oil, bitumen, natural\ngas, NGLs and LNG for transport.\nThe facilities, equipment and diluents we rely\non may be temporarily\nunavailable to us due to market conditions, extreme\nweather events, regulatory reasons, mechanical\nreasons or\nother factors or conditions, many of which are\nbeyond our control.\nIn addition, in certain newer plays, the\ncapacity of necessary facilities, equipment and diluents\nmay not be sufficient to accommodate production\nfrom\nexisting and new wells, and construction and permitting\ndelays, permitting costs and regulatory or other\nconstraints could limit or delay the construction,\nmanufacture or other acquisition of new facilities\nand\nequipment.\nIf any facilities, equipment or diluents, or\nany of the transportation methods and channels\nthat we\nrely on become unavailable for any period of time,\nwe may incur increased costs to transport\nour crude oil,\nbitumen, natural gas, NGLs and LNG for sale or\nwe may be forced to curtail our production\nof crude oil,\nbitumen, natural gas or NGLs.\nOur investments in joint ventures decrease\nour ability to manage risk.\nWe conduct many of our operations through joint ventures in which we may share\ncontrol with our joint\nventure partners.\nThere is a risk our joint venture participants may\nat any time have economic, business or\nlegal interests or goals that are inconsistent with\nthose of the joint venture or us, or our joint\nventure partners\nmay be unable to meet their economic or other\nobligations and we may be required to\nfulfill those obligations\nalone.\nFailure by us, or an entity in which we have\na joint venture interest, to adequately manage\nthe risks\nassociated with any operations, acquisitions or\ndispositions could have a material adverse effect on the\nfinancial condition or results of operations of our\njoint ventures and, in turn, our business and\noperations.\nOur operations present hazards and risks that\nrequire significant and continuous oversight.\nThe scope and nature of our operations present\na variety of significant hazards and risks, including\noperational\nhazards and risks such as explosions, fires,\ncrude oil spills, severe weather, geological events, labor disputes,\narmed hostilities, terrorist attacks, sabotage, civil\nunrest or cyber attacks.\nOur operations may also be\nadversely affected by unavailability, interruptions or accidents involving services\nor infrastructure required to\ndevelop, produce, process or transport our production,\nsuch as contract labor, drilling rigs, pipelines, railcars,\ntankers, barges or other infrastructure.\nOur operations are subject to the additional hazards\nof pollution,\nreleases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards\nand risks.\nOffshore activities may pose incrementally\ngreater risks because of complex subsurface\nconditions such as higher reservoir pressures,\nwater depths and\nmetocean conditions.\nAll such hazards could result in loss of human\nlife, significant property and equipment\ndamage, environmental pollution, impairment\nof operations, substantial losses to us and damage to\nour\nreputation.\nFurther, our business and operations may be disrupted if\nwe do not respond, or are perceived not to\nrespond, in an appropriate manner to any of these hazards\nand risks or any other major crisis or if\nwe are\nunable to efficiently restore or replace affected operational\ncomponents and capacity.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating\ncosts as a result of our\ncompliance with existing and future environmental\nlaws and regulations.\nOur business is subject to numerous laws and regulations\nrelating to the protection of the environment, which\nare expected to continue to have an increasing\nimpact on our operations.\nFor a description of the most\nsignificant of these environmental laws and regulations,\nsee the \u201cContingencies-Environmental\u201d and\n\u201cContingencies-Climate Change\u201d sections\nof Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations.\nThese laws and regulations continue to increase in\nboth number and complexity\nand affect our operations with respect to, among other things:\n\u25cf\nPermits required in connection with exploration,\ndrilling, production and other activities, including\nthose issued by national, subnational, and local authorities;\n\u25cf\nThe discharge of pollutants into the environment;\n\u25cf\nEmissions into the atmosphere, such as nitrogen\noxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury and GHG emissions;\n\u25cf\nCarbon taxes;\n\u25cf\nThe handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal\nand cleanup of hazardous materials and hazardous\nand nonhazardous wastes;\n\u25cf\nThe dismantlement, abandonment and restoration\nof our properties and facilities at the end of\ntheir\nuseful lives;\nand\n\u25cf\nExploration and production activities\nin certain areas, such as offshore environments, arctic fields,\noil\nsands reservoirs and unconventional plays.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance,\nand remediation\nexpenditures as a result of these laws and regulations.\nAny failure by us to comply with existing\nor future\nlaws, regulations and other requirements could result\nin administrative or civil penalties, criminal\nfines, other\nenforcement actions or third-party litigation\nagainst us.\nTo the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are\nnot ultimately reflected in the prices of our products\nand services, our business, financial\ncondition, results of\noperations and cash flows in future periods could\nbe materially adversely affected.\nExisting and future laws, regulations and internal\ninitiatives relating to global climate change,\nsuch as\nlimitations on GHG emissions, may impact or limit\nour business plans, result in significant expenditures,\npromote alternative uses of energy or reduce demand\nfor our products.\nContinuing political and social attention to the\nissue of global climate change has resulted in\nboth existing and\npending international agreements and national,\nregional or local legislation and regulatory\nmeasures to limit\nGHG emissions, such as cap and trade regimes, carbon\ntaxes, restrictive permitting, increased fuel efficiency\nstandards and incentives or mandates for renewable\nenergy.\nFor example, in December 2015, the U.S. joined\nthe international community at the 21st Conference\nof the Parties of the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change in Paris that\nprepared an agreement requiring member countries\nto review and\nrepresent a progression in their intended GHG\nemission reduction goals every five years\nbeginning in 2020.\nWhile the U.S. previously withdrew from the\nParis Agreement, the new administration\nhas recommitted the\nUnited States to the Paris Agreement, and a significant\nnumber of U.S. state and local governments\nand major\ncorporations headquartered in the U.S. have also announced\ntheir intention to satisfy these commitments.\nIn\naddition, our operations continue in countries around\nthe world which are party to, and have not announced\nan\nintent to withdraw from, the Paris Agreement.\nThe implementation of current agreements\nand regulatory\nmeasures, as well as any future agreements or measures\naddressing climate change and GHG emissions,\nmay\nadversely impact the demand for our products,\nimpose taxes on our products or operations or\nrequire us to\npurchase emission credits or reduce emission of\nGHGs from our operations.\nAs a result, we may experience\ndeclines in commodity prices or incur substantial\ncapital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance\nand remediation costs, any of which may have\nan adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn October 2020, we announced the adoption of a\nParis-aligned climate risk framework, whereby\nwe\ncommitted to a reduction of our gross operated\n(scope 1 and 2) emissions intensity, with an ambition to\nachieve net zero by 2050 from operated emissions.\nWe also endorsed the World Bank Zero Routine Flaring by\n2030 initiative, with an ambition to meet that\ngoal by 2025 and reaffirmed our commitment to advocate\nfor\nreduction of scope 3 emissions intensity through\nour support for a U.S. carbon price.\nCompliance with, and\nachievement of, climate change related internal initiatives\nsuch as the foregoing may increase costs, require\nus\nto purchase emission credits, or limit or\nimpact our business plans, potentially resulting in the\nreduction to the\neconomic end-of-field life of certain assets\nand an impairment of the associated net book\nvalue.\nIncreasing attention to global climate change has\nalso resulted in pressure upon stockholders,\nfinancial\ninstitutions and/or financial markets to modify\ntheir relationships with oil and gas companies\nand to limit\ninvestments and/or funding to such companies.\nFor example, in 2019 Norway\u2019s Government Pension Fund\nannounced it would reduce its investment exposure\nto companies that explore for oil and gas,\nand in 2020 a\nnumber of major financial institutions\nannounced that they would no longer finance oil and\ngas exploration\nprojects in the Arctic.\nAs public pressure continues to mount, our access to\ncapital on terms we find favorable\n(if it is available at all) may be limited and our costs\nmay increase or our business and results\nof operations\nmay be otherwise adversely affected.\nFurthermore, increasing attention to global climate\nchange has resulted in an increased likelihood\nof\ngovernmental investigations and private litigation,\nwhich could increase our costs or otherwise adversely\naffect\nour business.\nBeginning in 2017, cities, counties, governments\nand other entities in several states in the U.S.\nhave filed lawsuits against oil and gas companies,\nincluding ConocoPhillips, seeking compensatory\ndamages\nand equitable relief to abate alleged climate change\nimpacts.\nAdditional lawsuits with similar allegations\nare\nexpected to be filed.\nThe amounts claimed by plaintiffs are unspecified\nand the legal and factual issues\ninvolved in these cases are unprecedented.\nConocoPhillips believes these lawsuits are factually\nand legally\nmeritless and are an inappropriate vehicle to address\nthe challenges associated with climate\nchange and will\nvigorously defend against such lawsuits.\nThe ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot\nbe predicted with\ncertainty, and we could incur substantial legal costs associated with defending\nthese and similar lawsuits in the\nfuture.\nIn addition, although we design and operate our\nbusiness operations to accommodate expected\nclimatic\nconditions, to the extent there are significant\nchanges in the earth\u2019s climate, such as more severe or frequent\nweather conditions in the markets where we operate\nor the areas where our assets reside, we could\nincur\nincreased expenses, our operations could be adversely\nimpacted, and demand for our products could fall.\nFor more information on legislation or precursors\nfor possible regulation relating to global climate\nchange that\naffect or could affect our operations and a description of the company\u2019s response, see the\n\u201cContingencies-\nClimate Change\u201d section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of\nOperations.\nDomestic and worldwide political and economic\ndevelopments could damage our operations and materially\nreduce our profitability and cash flows.\nActions of the U.S., state, local and foreign\ngovernments, through sanctions, tax and other\nlegislation,\nexecutive order and commercial restrictions,\ncould reduce our operating profitability both\nin the U.S. and\nabroad.\nIn certain locations, restrictions\non our operations; special taxes or tax assessments;\nand payment\ntransparency regulations that could require us to\ndisclose competitively sensitive information\nor might cause us\nto violate non-disclosure laws\nof other countries have been imposed or proposed\nby governments or certain\ninterest groups.\nFor example, in 2020 a ballot initiative\nknown as the Fair Share Act was proposed in the\nstate\nof Alaska, which, if enacted would have increased\nthe state\u2019s share of production revenues and required\nproducers to publicly disclose additional financial\ninformation.\nAlthough ultimately defeated, similar\ninitiatives may be proposed and may be successful\nin the future.\nThe change in control of Congress and the\nWhite House because of the 2020 election increases\nthe possibility of the promulgation of more stringent\nregulations of our operations and the enactment\nof tax law changes that may adversely affect the fossil\nfuel\nindustry.\nIn addition, the current administration\nmay use the Congressional Review Act to repeal\nthe\nregulations finalized in the last five months of the\nprior administration.\nWe also cannot rule out the possibility\nof similar regulatory shifts and attendant cost and\nmarket access implications in other international\njurisdictions.\nOne area subject to significant political\nand regulatory activity is the use of hydraulic\nfracturing, an essential\ncompletion technique that facilitates production\nof oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower\npermeability\nrock formations.\nA range of local, state, federal and national laws\nand regulations currently govern or, in some\nhydraulic fracturing operations, prohibit hydraulic\nfracturing in some jurisdictions.\nAlthough hydraulic\nfracturing has been conducted safely for many\ndecades, a number of new laws, regulations\nand permitting\nrequirements are under consideration which could\nresult in increased costs, operating restrictions,\noperational\ndelays or could limit the ability to develop oil and\nnatural gas resources.\nCertain jurisdictions in which we\noperate have adopted or are considering regulations\nthat could impose new or more stringent\npermitting,\ndisclosure or other regulatory requirements on\nhydraulic fracturing or other oil and natural\ngas operations,\nincluding subsurface water disposal.\nOn January 27, 2021, the new administration\nsigned an executive order\ndirecting the Secretary of the Interior to stop\nissuing new oil and gas leases on federal\nlands, allowing time to\nreview and reset the Federal Government\u2019s oil and gas leasing program.\nExisting production and permits\nalready issued on Federal lands were not impacted\nby this order.\nIf this temporary moratorium were to be\nextended indefinitely, we believe we can mitigate the impact for a considerable\nperiod of time with our current\npermits and adjusting our development plans across\nour diverse acreage position.\nIn addition, certain interest groups have also\nproposed ballot initiatives and constitutional\namendments\ndesigned to restrict oil and natural gas development\ngenerally and hydraulic fracturing in particular.\nIn the\nevent that ballot initiatives, local, state,\nor national restrictions or prohibitions are adopted\nand result in more\nstringent limitations on the production and development\nof oil and natural gas in areas where we conduct\noperations, we may incur significant costs to\ncomply with such requirements or may experience\ndelays or\ncurtailment in the permitting or pursuit of exploration,\ndevelopment or production activities.\nSuch compliance\ncosts and delays, curtailments, limitations or\nprohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness,\nprospects, results of operations, financial condition\nand liquidity.\nThe U.S. government can also prevent or restrict\nus from doing business in foreign countries.\nThese\nrestrictions and those of foreign governments\nhave in the past limited our ability to\noperate in, or gain access\nto, opportunities in various countries.\nActions by host governments, such as the expropriation\nof our oil assets\nby the Venezuelan government, have affected operations significantly in the past and may continue to\ndo so in\nthe future.\nChanges in domestic and international policies\nand regulations may affect our ability to collect\npayments such as those pertaining to the settlement\nwith PDVSA or the ICSID Award against the Government\nof Venezuela; or to obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for drilling and development\nof wells\nin various locations.\nSimilarly, the declaration of a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d could result in actions to limit\nexports of our products and other restrictions.\nLocal political and economic factors in international\nmarkets could have a material adverse effect on us.\nApproximately 48 percent of our hydrocarbon\nproduction was derived from production outside\nthe U.S. in\n2020, and 42 percent of our proved reserves, as\nof December 31, 2020, were located outside\nthe U.S.\nWe are\nsubject to risks associated with operations in international\nmarkets, including changes in foreign governmental\npolicies relating to crude oil, natural gas, bitumen,\nNGLs or LNG pricing and taxation, other\npolitical,\neconomic or diplomatic developments (including\nthe macro effects of international trade policies and\ndisputes), potentially disruptive geopolitical\nconditions,\nand international monetary and currency rate\nfluctuations.\nIn addition, some countries where we operate\nlack a fully independent judiciary system.\nThis,\ncoupled with changes in foreign law or policy, results in a lack of legal certainty\nthat exposes our operations to\nincreased risks, including increased difficulty in enforcing\nour agreements in those jurisdictions and increased\nrisks of adverse actions by local government authorities,\nsuch as expropriations.\nRisks Related to Our Acquisition of Concho\nCombining our business with Concho\u2019s may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming\nthan expected and\nwe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits\nof the Merger, which may adversely affect our business results\nand negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nOur acquisition of Concho (the Merger)\ninvolved\nthe combination of two companies which, until\nthe\ncompletion of the Merger,\noperated\nas independent public companies.\nThe success of the Merger will depend\non, among other things, the ability of our\ntwo companies to combine our businesses in\na manner that adds\nvalue to shareholders.\nHowever, there can be no assurances that our respective businesses\ncan be integrated\nsuccessfully, and we will be required to devote significant management attention\nand resources to the\nintegration process.\nWe must achieve the anticipated improvement in free cash flow generation and returns\nand achieve the planned cost savings without adversely\naffecting current revenues or compromising the\ndisciplined investment philosophy to maximize value\nfor shareholders.\nThere are a large number of processes, policies, procedures,\noperations and technologies and systems that must\nbe integrated, and although we expect that the\nelimination of duplicative costs, strategic\nbenefits, and\nadditional income, as well as the realization\nof other efficiencies related to the integration of the business,\nmay\noffset incremental transaction and Merger-related costs over time, we may\nencounter difficulties in the\nintegration and any net benefit may not be achieved\nin the near term or at all.\nIt is possible that the integration\nprocess could take longer than originally anticipated\nand could result in the loss of key employees;\nthe loss of\ncommercial and vendor partners;\nthe disruption of our ongoing businesses;\ninconsistencies in standards,\ncontrols, procedures and policies;\nunexpected integration issues;\nand higher than expected integration costs.\nAn inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated\nbenefits of the Merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, as well as any delays\nencountered in the integration process, could\nhave an adverse effect upon the revenues, level of expenses\nand operating results of ConocoPhillips, which\nmay adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nThe market value of our common stock could\ndecline if large amounts of our common\nstock are sold now\nthat the Concho acquisition has been consummated.\nWe issued shares of ConocoPhillips common stock to former Concho stockholders.\nFormer Concho\nstockholders may decide not to hold the shares\nof ConocoPhillips common stock that they received\nin the\nMerger, and ConocoPhillips stockholders may decide to reduce their investment\nin ConocoPhillips as a result\nof the changes to ConocoPhillips\u2019 investment\nprofile as a result of the Merger.\nOther Concho stockholders,\nsuch as funds with limitations on their permitted\nholdings of stock in individual issuers, may\nbe required to sell\nthe shares of ConocoPhillips common stock that\nthey received in the Merger.\nSuch sales of ConocoPhillips\ncommon stock could have the effect of depressing the\nmarket price for ConocoPhillips common stock.\nOther Risk Factors Facing our Business or\nOperations\nWe may need additional capital in the future, and it may not be available on acceptable\nterms or at all.\nWe have historically relied primarily upon cash generated by our operations to fund\nour operations and\nstrategy; however, we have also relied from time to time on access to\nthe debt and equity capital markets for\nfunding.\nThere can be no assurance that additional debt\nor equity financing will be available in the future\non\nacceptable terms, or at all.\nIn addition, although we anticipate we\nwill be able to repay our existing\nindebtedness when it matures or in accordance\nwith our stated plans, there can be no assurance\nwe will be able\nto do so.\nOur ability to obtain additional financing or refinance\nour existing indebtedness when it matures\nor in\naccordance with our plans, will be subject\nto a number of factors, including market conditions,\nour operating\nperformance, investor sentiment and our ability\nto incur additional debt in compliance with agreements\ngoverning our then-outstanding debt.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient funds from\noperations or raise\nadditional capital for any reason, our business could\nbe adversely affected.\nIn addition, we are regularly evaluated by the major\nrating agencies based on a number of factors,\nincluding\nour financial strength and conditions affecting the oil\nand gas industry generally.\nWe and other industry\ncompanies have had their ratings reduced in the\npast due to negative commodity price outlooks.\nAny\ndowngrade in our credit rating or announcement\nthat our credit rating is under review for possible\ndowngrade\ncould increase the cost associated with any additional\nindebtedness we incur.\nOur business may be adversely affected by deterioration\nin the credit quality of, or defaults under our\ncontracts with, third parties with whom we do\nbusiness.\nThe operation of our business requires us to engage\nin transactions with numerous counterparties\noperating in a\nvariety of industries, including other companies\noperating in the oil and gas industry.\nThese counterparties\nmay default on their obligations to us as a result\nof operational failures or a lack of liquidity, or for other\nreasons, including bankruptcy.\nMarket speculation about the credit quality\nof these counterparties, or their\nability to continue performing on their existing obligations,\nmay also exacerbate any operational difficulties\nor\nliquidity issues they are experiencing, particularly\nas it relates to other companies in the oil and gas industry\nas\na result of the volatility in commodity prices.\nAny default by any of our counterparties may\nresult in our\ninability to perform our obligations under agreements\nwe have made with third parties or may otherwise\nadversely affect our business or results of operations.\nIn addition, our rights against any of our counterparties\nas a result of a default may not be adequate to\ncompensate us for the resulting harm caused\nor may not be\nenforceable at all in some circumstances.\nWe may also be forced to incur additional costs as we attempt to\nenforce any rights we have against a defaulting\ncounterparty, which could further adversely impact our results\nof operations.\nIn particular, in August 2018, we entered into a settlement\nagreement with Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A.\n(PDVSA) providing for the payment of approximately\n$2 billion over a five-year period in connection\nwith an\narbitration award issued by the International\nChamber of Commerce (ICC) Tribunal in favor of ConocoPhillips\non a contractual dispute arising from Venezuela\u2019s expropriation of our interests in the Petrozuata and Hamaca\nheavy oil ventures and other pre-expropriation\nfiscal measures.\nWe have collected approximately $0.8 billion\nof the $2.0 billion settlement to date and PDVSA\nhas defaulted on its remaining payment obligations\nunder\nthis agreement.\nWe are therefore incurring additional costs as we seek to recover any unpaid amounts\nunder\nthe agreement.\nAdditionally, in March 2019, an ICSID arbitration tribunal issued an award\nunanimously\nordering the government of Venezuela to pay ConocoPhillips approximately $8.7 billion in compensation\nfor\nthe government\u2019s unlawful expropriation of the company\u2019s investments in Venezuela in 2007.\nConocoPhillips\nhas filed requests for recognition of the award in several\njurisdictions.\nOn August 29, 2019, the ICSID tribunal\nissued a decision rectifying the award and reducing\nit by approximately $227 million.\nThe award now stands\nat $8.5 billion plus interest.\nThe government of Venezuela is seeking annulment of the award before another\npanel at ICSID and annulment proceedings\nare underway.\nNo amounts have been collected as a result of this\naward yet.\nOur ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase\nshares is subject to certain considerations.\nDividends are authorized and determined by\nour Board of Directors in its sole discretion\nand depend upon a\nnumber of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nCash available for distribution;\n\u25cf\nOur results of operations and anticipated future\nresults of operations;\n\u25cf\nOur financial condition, especially in relation\nto the anticipated future capital needs of our\nproperties;\n\u25cf\nThe level of distributions paid by comparable companies;\n\u25cf\nOur operating expenses; and\n\u25cf\nOther factors our Board of Directors deems\nrelevant.\nWe expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders; however, our Board of Directors may\nreduce our dividend or cease declaring dividends\nat any time, including if it determines that\nour net cash\nprovided by operating activities,\nafter deducting capital expenditures and investments,\nare not sufficient to pay\nour desired levels of dividends to our stockholders\nor to pay dividends to our stockholders at all.\nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2020,\n$14.5 billion of repurchase authority remained\nof the $25 billion share\nrepurchase program our Board of Directors had\nauthorized.\nOur share repurchase program does not\nobligate us\nto acquire a specific number of shares during any\nperiod, and our decision to commence, discontinue\nor resume\nrepurchases in any period will depend on the same\nfactors that our Board of Directors\nmay consider when\ndeclaring dividends, among others.\nIn the past we have suspended our share repurchase\nprogram in response\nto market downturns, and we may do so again\nin the future.\nAny downward revision in the amount of dividends\nwe pay to stockholders or the number of shares\nwe\npurchase under our share repurchase program could\nhave an adverse effect on the market price of our common\nstock.\nThere are substantial risks with any acquisitions\nor divestitures we may choose to undertake.\nWe regularly review our portfolio and pursue growth through acquisitions\nand seek to divest non-core assets or\nbusinesses.\nWe may not be able to complete these transactions on favorable terms, on\na timely basis, or at all.\nEven if we do complete such\ntransactions, our cash flow from operations may be\nadversely impacted or\notherwise the transactions\nmay not result in the benefits anticipated\ndue to various risks, including, but not\nlimited to (i) the failure of the acquired assets or\nbusinesses to meet or exceed expected returns,\nincluding risk\nof impairment; (ii) difficulties in integrating the operations,\ntechnologies, products and personnel of the\nacquired assets or businesses; (iii) the inability\nto dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory\nterms and conditions; and (iv) the discovery of\nunknown and unforeseen liabilities or\nother issues related to\nany acquisition for which contractual protections\nare inadequate or we lack insurance or indemnities,\nincluding\nenvironmental liabilities, or with regard to divested\nassets or businesses, claims by purchasers\nto whom we\nhave provided contractual indemnification.\nOur technologies, systems and networks may be subject\nto cyber attacks.\nOur business, like others within the oil and gas\nindustry, has become increasingly dependent on digital\ntechnologies, some of which are managed by third-party\nservice providers on whom we rely to\nhelp us collect,\nhost or process information.\nAmong other activities, we rely on digital technology\nto estimate oil and gas\nreserves, process and record financial and operating\ndata, analyze seismic and drilling information\nand\ncommunicate with employees and third-parties.\nAs a result, we face various cyber security\nthreats such as\nattempts to gain unauthorized access to, or control\nof, sensitive information about our operations\nand our\nemployees, attempts to render our data or systems\n(or those of third-parties with whom we do\nbusiness)\ncorrupted or unusable, threats to the security\nof our facilities and infrastructure as well as\nthose of third-parties\nwith whom we do business and attempted cyber\nterrorism.\nIn addition, computers control oil and gas production,\nprocessing equipment and distribution\nsystems globally\nand are necessary to deliver our production to market.\nA disruption, failure, or a cyber breach of these\noperating systems, or of the networks and infrastructure\non which they rely, many of which are not owned or\noperated by us, could damage critical production,\ndistribution or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery\nto\nmarkets or make it difficult or impossible to accurately\naccount for production and settle transactions.\nAlthough we have experienced occasional breaches\nof our cyber security, none of these breaches have had a\nmaterial effect on our business, operations or reputation.\nAs cyber attacks continue to evolve, we must\ncontinually expend additional resources to continue\nto modify or enhance our protective measures\nor to\ninvestigate and remediate any vulnerabilities\ndetected.\nOur implementation of various procedures\nand controls\nto monitor and mitigate security threats\nand to increase security for our information, facilities\nand\ninfrastructure may result in increased costs.\nDespite our ongoing investments in security\nresources, talent and\nbusiness practices, we are unable to assure that\nany security measures will be effective.\nIf our systems and infrastructure were to be breached,\ndamaged or disrupted, we could be subject to serious\nnegative consequences, including disruption of\nour operations, damage to our reputation,\na loss of counterparty\ntrust, reimbursement or other costs, increased compliance\ncosts, significant litigation exposure and legal\nliability or regulatory fines, penalties or intervention.\nAny of these could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations or financial condition.\nAlthough we have business continuity plans in\nplace, our\noperations may be adversely affected by significant and\nwidespread disruption to our systems and\ninfrastructure that support our business.\nWhile we continue to evolve and modify our\nbusiness continuity\nplans, there can be no assurance that they will\nbe effective in avoiding disruption and business impacts.\nFurther, our insurance may not be adequate to compensate us\nfor all resulting losses, and the cost to obtain\nadequate coverage may increase for us in the future.", "PERMNO": 13928, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "COP"}
