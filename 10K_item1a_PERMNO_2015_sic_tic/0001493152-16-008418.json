{"cik": "1021435", "company": "hopTo Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\tRisk Factors\nThe risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. The Risk Factors described below include the considerable risks associated with the current economic environment and the related potential adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. You should read these Risk Factors in conjunction with \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Item 8. There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. Those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of operating losses and expect these losses to continue, at least for the near future.\nWe have experienced significant operating losses since we began operations. We incurred losses from operations before provision for income taxes of $4,387,400 and $3,590,800 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We expect to report an operating loss on a consolidated basis for the year ended December 31, 2016. In subsequent reporting periods, if revenues grow more slowly than anticipated, or if aggregate operating expenses exceed expectations, we will continue to be unprofitable. Even if we become profitable, we may be unable to sustain such profitability.\nhopTo is subject to the risks of new software products in development and any failure to successfully commercially launch hopTo could have a material negative impact on us. Our integration with Citrix is subject to these risks as well as the additional risks of being reliant on Citrix for cooperation.\nDuring April 2013, we launched the first public release of hopTo through Apple\u2019s App Store and on November 14, 2013 we launched the first commercial version of hopTo through Apple\u2019s App Store. The releases were targeted at Apple\u2019s tablet devices, the iPad and the iPad Mini. On November 10, 2014 we launched the first commercial version of hopTo Work through Apple\u2019s App Store. On November 12, 2015 we launched hopTo Work for Citrix through Apple\u2019s App Store.\nFuture releases will be targeted at other devices such as Apple\u2019s iPhone, as well as competing devices such as those based on Google\u2019s Android platform. There is no assurance that we will be able to develop a commercially viable version of our hopTo product, or that we may be able to successfully penetrate into its perceived marketplace. Any failure to develop a commercially viable version or to successfully penetrate into the market could have a material negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flow.\nhopTo and hopTo Work are new products in development. As such they face both development and market risks. Our development timetable could be adversely impacted by technical challenges that take longer than expected or require more engineering or capital resources to resolve. Our development timetable can also be adversely affected by third party delays, such as our current integration efforts with Citrix Systems or qualification standards imposed by companies such as Apple Inc. in the administration of the Apple App Store.\nOur current Citrix integration effort, begun in the fourth quarter of 2015, is a substantial technical challenge, and is subject to the aforementioned software development risks, as well as the added risk that we require cooperation from Citrix to complete the integration, which is at their sole discretion to provide.\nEven a successful and timely launch on app stores does not assure wide-scale adoption of a new product given the extremely competitive market for new productivity applications and the changing and difficult to ascertain demands of our target customers and users. In addition, we must develop a successful pricing policy to economically benefit from our development investments. Pricing policies are subject to considerable variation and require a high degree of judgment, and any significant failure to appropriately price our products could limit or even prevent our ability to effectively compete and profit from those products.\nOur revenue is typically generated from a limited number of significant customers.\nA material portion of our revenue, all of which is currently derived from our GO-Global products, during any reporting period is typically generated from a limited number of significant customers, all of which are unrelated third parties. We categorize our customers into three broad categories for revenue recognition purposes: stocking resellers, non-stocking resellers and direct end users. If any of our significant non-stocking resellers or direct end users reduce their order level or fail to order during a reporting period, our revenue could be materially adversely impacted because we recognize revenue on sales to these customers upon product delivery, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nOur significant stocking resellers are typically ISVs who have bundled our products with theirs to sell as Web-enabled versions of their products. These customers maintain inventories of our products for resale, and we do not recognize revenue until our products are resold to end users, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. If these customers decide to maintain a lower level of inventory in the future and/or they are unable to sell their inventory to end users as quickly as they have in the past, our revenue and business could be materially adversely impacted.\nIf we are unable to develop new products and enhancements to our existing products, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted.\nThe market for our products and services is characterized by:\n\u25cf frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements;\n\u25cf rapid technological change;\n\u25cf evolving industry standards;\n\u25cf fluctuations in customer demand; and\n\u25cf changes in customer requirements.\nOur future success depends on our ability to continually enhance our current products and develop and introduce new products that our customers choose to buy. If we are unable to satisfy our customers\u2019 demands and remain competitive with other products that could satisfy their needs by introducing new products and enhancements, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted. Our future success could be hindered by, among other factors:\n\u25cf the amount of cash we have available to fund investment in new products and enhancements;\n\u25cf delays in our introduction of new products and/or enhancements of existing products;\n\u25cf delays in market acceptance of new products and/or enhancements of existing products; and\n\u25cf a competitor\u2019s announcement of new products and/or product enhancements or technologies that could replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing products.\nFor example, sales of our GO-Global Windows Host software could be affected by the announcement from Microsoft of an intended release, and the subsequent actual release, of a new Windows-based operating system, or an upgrade to a previously released Windows-based operating system version. These new or upgraded systems may contain similar features to our products or they could contain architectural changes that would temporarily prevent our products from functioning properly within a Windows-based operating system environment.\nOur operations consume cash and we will need to raise additional capital in the future to fund our continued operating needs.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our cash balance was $1,777,300, as compared with $1,557,100 as of December 31, 2014, an increase of $220,200, or 14.1%. The increase primarily resulted from the cash provided by the payment received in January 2015 for a $1.5 million stocking order from one of our GO-Global ISV resellers and cash received of $2,550,500 on July 28, 2015 as a result of the sale of shares of our common stock in a private placement (the \u201c2015 Private Placement\u201d). These cash receipts were partially offset by consumption by our operations, as well as the investments we made in fixed assets, and employee costs, primarily associated with our new products development team.\nBased on our cash on hand as of December 31, 2015, the cash we anticipate to derive from our legacy GO-Global business, and the cash we anticipate to derive from our hopTo Work product, we believe that we will have sufficient resources to support our operational plans for the next twelve months; however full implementation of our business plans for the next twelve months will require capital from issuances of debt or equity, or greater than expected revenue from our recently launched hopTo Work product or our GO-Global product line.\nThere can be no assurance of new revenue from new or existing product lines or additional capital from debt or equity issuances. In addition, issuances of new capital stock would dilute existing stockholders and may give the purchasers of new capital stock additional rights, preferences and privileges relative to existing stockholders. There can be no assurance that additional capital necessary for full execution of our hopTo business strategy will be available on a timely basis, on reasonable terms or at all.\nIn the event that revenues from our current products or future products are not consistent with the levels assumed in our current operational plans and we are not able to secure new capital through issuances of debt or equity, we may need to reorganize our operations to continue to maintain our current business.\nSales of products within our GO-Global product families are likely to be our primary source of revenue during 2016.\nAlthough we believe that we will begin to generate revenue through sales of hopTo Work during 2016, we anticipate that sales of products within our GO-Global product families, and related enhancements, will be our primary source of revenue during 2016. The success, if any, of our new GO-Global releases may depend on a number of factors, including market acceptance of the new GO-Global releases and our ability to manage the risks associated with introducing such releases. Declines in demand for our GO-Global products could occur as a result of, among other factors:\n\u25cf lack of success with our strategic partners;\n\u25cf new competitive product releases and updates to existing competitive products;\n\u25cf decreasing or stagnant information technology spending levels;\n\u25cf price competition;\n\u25cf technological changes; or\n\u25cf general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate.\nIf our customers do not continue to purchase GO-Global products as a result of these or other factors, our revenue would decrease and our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nOur operating results in one or more future periods are likely to fluctuate significantly and may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of investors.\nOur operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future on a quarterly and annual basis due to a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. Factors that could cause our operating results and therefore our revenues to fluctuate include the following, among other factors:\n\u25cf our ability to maximize the revenue opportunities of our patents;\n\u25cf variations in the size of orders by our customers;\n\u25cf increased competition; and\n\u25cf the proportion of overall revenues derived from different sales channels such as distributors, original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d) and others.\nIn addition, our royalty and license revenues are impacted by fluctuations in OEM licensing activity from quarter to quarter, which may involve one-time orders from non-recurring customers, or customers who order infrequently. Our expense levels are based, in part, on expected future orders and sales; therefore, if orders and sales levels are below expectations, our operating results are likely to be materially adversely affected. Additionally, because significant portions of our expenses are fixed, a reduction in sales levels may disproportionately affect our net income. Also, we may reduce prices and/or increase spending in response to competition or to pursue new market opportunities. Because of these factors, our operating results in one or more future periods may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of investors. In that event, the trading price of our common stock would likely be adversely affected.\nWe will encounter challenges in recruiting, hiring and retaining new personnel and/or replacements for any members of key management or other personnel who depart.\nOur success and business strategy is dependent in large part on our ability to attract and retain key management and other personnel in certain areas of our business. If any of these employees were to leave, we would need to attract and retain replacements for them. We have lost employees, including at the officer level and in our new products engineering group, in the past. Without a successful replacement, the loss of the services of one or more key members of our management group and other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWith the exception of the employment agreement we entered into with our Chief Executive Officer during 2013, we do not have long-term employment agreements with any of our key personnel and any officer or other employee can terminate their relationship with us at any time. We may also need to add key personnel in the future in order to successfully implement our business strategies. The market for such qualified personnel is highly competitive and it includes other potential employers whose financial resources for such qualified personnel are more substantial than ours. Consequently, we could find it difficult to attract, assimilate or retain such qualified personnel in sufficient numbers to successfully implement our business strategies.\nOur failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights may adversely affect us.\nOur commercial success is dependent, in large part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, as well as trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. These measures afford only limited protection. We cannot assure you that measures we have taken or may take in the future will be adequate to protect us from misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property. Despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property or other proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that the existence of any proprietary rights will prevent the development of competitive products. The infringement upon, or loss of, any proprietary rights, or the development of competitive products despite such proprietary rights, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business significantly benefits from strategic relationships and there can be no assurance that such relationships will continue in the future.\nOur business and strategy relies to a significant extent on our strategic relationships with other companies. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain or further develop any of these relationships or to replace them in the event any of these relationships are terminated. In addition, any failure to renew or extend any license between any third party and us may adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on indirect distribution channels for our products and may not be able to retain existing reseller relationships or develop new reseller relationships.\nOur GO-Global and hopTo Work products are primarily sold through several distribution channels. An integral part of our strategy is to strengthen our relationships with resellers such as OEMs, systems integrators, VARs, distributors and other vendors to encourage these parties to recommend or distribute our products and to add resellers both domestically and internationally. We currently invest, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources to expand our sales and marketing capabilities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and/or retain resellers to market our products effectively. Our inability to attract resellers and the loss of any current reseller relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Additionally, we cannot assure you that resellers will devote enough resources to provide effective sales and marketing support to our products.\nThe markets in which we participate are highly competitive and have more established competitors.\nThe markets we participate in with GO-Global and hopTo Work are intensely competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to continuous technological changes. We expect competition to increase in each of these markets as other companies introduce additional competitive products. In order to compete effectively, we must continually develop and market new and enhanced products and market those products at competitive prices. As markets for our products continue to develop, additional companies, including companies in the computer hardware, software and networking industries with significant market presence, may enter the markets in which we compete and further intensify competition. A number of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and significantly greater financial, sales, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. We cannot give any assurance that our competitors will not develop and market competitive products that will offer superior price or performance features, or that new competitors will not enter our markets and offer such products. We believe that we will need to invest significant financial resources in research and development to remain competitive in the future in each of the markets in which we compete. Such financial resources may not be available to us at the time or times that we need them, or upon terms acceptable to us, or at all. We cannot assure you that we will be able to establish and maintain a significant market position in the face of our competition and our failure to do so would adversely affect our business.\nRisk Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock is thinly traded and its price has been historically volatile.\nOur stock is thinly traded. As such, holders of our stock are subject to a high risk of illiquidity, e.g., you may not be able to sell as many shares at the price you would like, or you may not be able to purchase as many shares at the price you would like, due to the low average daily trading volume of our stock. Additionally, the market price of our stock has historically been volatile; it has fluctuated significantly to date. The trading price of our stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. Your investment in our stock could lose some or all of its value.\nFuture sales of our common stock could adversely affect its price and our future capital-raising activities, and could involve the issuance of additional equity securities, which would dilute current shareholder investments in our common stock and could result in lowering the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may sell securities in the public or private equity markets if and when conditions are favorable. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital. We may issue additional common stock in future financing transactions or as incentive compensation for our management team and other key personnel, consultants and advisors. Issuing any equity securities would be dilutive to the equity interests represented by our then-outstanding shares of common stock. The market price for our common stock could decrease as the market takes into account the dilutive effect of any of these issuances. Furthermore, we may enter into financing transactions and issue securities with rights and preferences senior to the rights and preferences of our common stock, and we may issue securities at prices that represent a substantial discount to the market price of our common stock. A negative reaction by investors and securities analysts to any discounted sale of our equity securities could result in a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have a significant number of outstanding warrants and options, and future sales of these shares could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had outstanding warrants for an aggregate of 1,411,619 and 1,411,619 shares of common stock, respectively, at weighted average exercise prices of $6.90 per share for both years. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 705,990 and 685,867 shares of common stock, respectively, at weighted average exercise prices of $2.63 and $2.70 per share, respectively. The holders may sell these shares exercisable under warrants or options in the public markets from time to time. In addition, as our stock price rises, more outstanding warrants and options will be \u201cin-the-money\u201d and the holders may exercise their warrants and options and sell a large number of shares. This could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur common stock is quoted on the FINRA OTC Bulletin Board, which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.\nOur common stock is currently quoted under the symbol \u201cHPTO\u201d on the OTC Bulletin Board market (\u201cOTCBB\u201d) operated by FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) and on the OTC Markets Group QB tier (\u201cOTCQB\u201d). Neither the OTCBB nor the OTCQB is a \u201cnational securities exchange,\u201d and in general, each is a significantly more limited market than the markets operated by the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. The quotation of our shares on the OTCBB and the OTCQB could result in a less liquid market being available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock, which could depress the trading price of our common stock and have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future. Because of the limited trading market for our common stock, and because of the significant price volatility, investors may not be able to sell their shares of common stock when they want to do so.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock, nor do we anticipate paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the operations and expansion of our business. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon the earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements and other factors as deemed necessary by our Board of Directors.\nFINRA\u2019s sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our stock.\nFINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA\u2019s requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws and applicable Delaware law may prevent or discourage third parties or our stockholders from attempting to replace our management or influencing significant decisions.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or our management, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include authorizing our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders and providing that stockholders cannot take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting. As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), which among other things, and subject to various exceptions, restricts against certain business transactions between a corporation and a stockholder owning 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock (\u201can interested stockholder\u201d) for a period of three years from the date the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder unless our Board of Directors approved the holder\u2019s acquisition of our stock in advance. Together, these charter and statutory provisions could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nRisks Related to the Reverse Split\nOn January 27, 2016, we filed an amendment of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to effect a 1-for-15 reverse stock split of our common stock. The reverse stock split became effective in the stock market upon commencement of trading on January 28, 2016. If the market price of our common stock declines following the reverse stock split, the percentage decline may be greater than would occur in the absence of a reverse stock split.\nThe reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock is intended to increase the market price of our common stock. However, the effect of a reverse stock split upon the market price of our common stock cannot be predicted with certainty, and the results of reverse stock splits by companies in similar circumstances have been varied. It is not uncommon for the market price of a company\u2019s common stock to decline in the period following a reverse stock split. If the market price of our common stock declines following the reverse stock split, the percentage decline may be greater than would occur in the absence of a reverse stock split. In any event, other factors unrelated to the number of shares of our common stock outstanding, such as negative financial or operational results, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe reverse stock split may decrease the liquidity of the shares of our common stock.\nThe liquidity of the shares of our common stock may be affected adversely by the reverse stock split given the reduced number of shares that are outstanding following the reverse stock split, especially if the market price of our common stock does not increase as a result of the reverse stock split. In addition, the reverse stock split increased the number of stockholders who own odd lots (less than 100 shares) of our common stock, creating the potential for such stockholders to experience an increase in the cost of selling their shares and greater difficulty effecting such sales.\nFollowing the reverse stock split, the resulting market price of our common stock may not attract new investors, including institutional investors, and may not satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. Consequently, the trading liquidity of our common stock may not improve.\nAlthough we believe that a higher market price of our common stock may help generate greater or broader investor interest, there can be no assurance that the reverse stock split will result in a share price that will attract new investors, including institutional investors. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. As a result, the trading liquidity of our common stock may not necessarily improve.", "PERMNO": 87163, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "HPTO"}
