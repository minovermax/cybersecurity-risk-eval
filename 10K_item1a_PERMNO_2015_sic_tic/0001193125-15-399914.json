{"cik": "887733", "company": "CENTRAL GARDEN & PET CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-12-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThis Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of factors both in and out of our control, including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below. In addition, the risks described below are not the only ones facing us. We have only described the risks we consider to be material. However, there may be additional risks that are viewed by us as not material at the present time or are not presently known to us. Conditions could change in the future, or new information may come to our attention that could impact our assessment of these risks.\nIf any of the events described below were to occur, our business, prospects, financial condition and/or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. When we say below that something could or will have a material adverse effect on us, we mean that it could or will have one or more of these effects. In any such case, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in our company.\nOur operating results and cash flow are susceptible to fluctuations.\nWe expect to continue to experience variability in our net sales, net income and cash flow on a quarterly basis. Factors that may contribute to this variability include:\n\u2022\nseasonality and adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in prices of commodity grains and other input costs;\n\u2022\noperational problems;\n\u2022\nshifts in demand for lawn and garden and pet products;\n\u2022\nchanges in product mix, service levels, marketing and pricing by us and our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe effect of acquisitions; and\n\u2022\neconomic stability and strength of our relationships with retailers.\nThese fluctuations could negatively impact our business and the market price of our common stock.\nSeeds and grains we use to produce bird feed and grass seed are commodity products subject to price volatility that has had, and could have, a negative impact on us.\nOur financial results are partially dependent upon the cost of raw materials and our ability to pass along increases in these costs to our customers. In particular, our Pennington and Kaytee businesses are exposed to fluctuations in market prices for commodity seeds and grains used to produce bird feed. Historically, market prices for commodity seeds and grains have fluctuated in response to a number of factors, including changes in United States government farm support programs, changes in international agricultural and trading policies and weather conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons.\nTo mitigate our exposure to changes in market prices, we enter into purchase contracts for grains, bird feed and grass seed to cover a limited portion of our purchase requirements for a selling season. Since these contracts\ncover only a portion of our purchase requirements, as market prices for such products increase, our cost of production increases as well. In contrast, if market prices for such products decrease, we may end up purchasing grains and seeds pursuant to the purchase contracts at prices above market.\nIn fiscal 2013, our weighted average cost per pound for our primary bird feed grains increased approximately 15% compared to fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2014, our weighted average cost per pound for our primary bird feed grains decreased approximately 32% compared with fiscal year 2013. In fiscal 2015, our weighted average cost per pound for our primary bird feed grains decreased slightly from fiscal 2014. Although we have been able to negotiate some price increases in the past with our retailers, it is possible that price increases may not fully offset rising costs in the future, resulting in margin erosion. We can provide no assurance as to the timing or extent of our ability to implement additional price adjustments in the event of increased costs in the future. Similarly, we can provide no assurance of our ability to retain pricing with our retailers in the context of declining costs. We also cannot predict to what extent price increases may negatively affect our sales volume. As retailers pass along price increases, consumers may shift to our lower margin bird feed, switch to competing products or reduce purchases of wild bird feed products.\nOur success depends upon our retaining key personnel.\nOur performance is substantially dependent upon the continued services of our senior management team. We have entered into an amendment to the employment agreement with John R. Ranelli, our President, Chief Executive Officer and acting President - Pet Segment which contemplates his retirement in September 2016, and plan to launch a search for his successor during fiscal 2016. William E. Brown, our Chairman of the Board, commenced a leave of absence in July as he continues to recover from injuries he sustained in an accident in his home earlier in the year. In addition, in September 2015, our Chief Financial Officer resigned, and our board of directors appointed David N. Chichester, a member of our board, as Acting Chief Financial Officer through February 2016. The loss of the services of these persons could have a material adverse effect on our business unless adequate replacements are found. Our future performance depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees, including a new Chief Executive Officer and new Chief Financial Officer. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees in the future.\nWe are subject to significant risks associated with innovation, including the risk that our new product innovations will not produce sufficient sales to recoup our investment.\nWe believe that our future success will depend upon, in part, our ability to continue to improve our existing products through product innovation and to develop, market and produce new products. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in the introduction, marketing and production of any new products or product innovations, or that we will develop and introduce in a timely manner improvements to our existing products which satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance. Our failure to develop new products and introduce them successfully and in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDuring fiscal 2013, we introduced two new Garden products. Despite support from our retailers and substantial marketing spend, the new products did not sell through as expected, and we took an $11.2 million charge related to inventory and product and packaging changes at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 relating to the new products. Despite a concerted effort to improve consumer takeaway of the products through product, packaging and placement changes, as well as aggressive promotions, we continued to experience weak consumer sales of the products in their second season and late in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 major retailers indicated that they would not support the products going forward. Consequently, we made the decision to discontinue the two products at the end of the 2014 garden season. As a result, we recorded a $16.9 million charge to operating income in fiscal 2014, to write off the remaining inventory of these products and to account for product returns, promotional allowances and other costs related to the discontinuance of the products. We believe that the period of time to gain consumer acceptance of major innovations is longer in the garden industry than in many industries, which compounds the risks generally associated with major new product innovations.\nA decline in consumers\u2019 discretionary spending or a change in consumer preferences could reduce our sales and harm our business.\nOur sales ultimately depend on consumer discretionary spending, which is influenced by factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, the availability of discretionary income and credit, weather, consumer confidence and unemployment levels. Any material decline in the amount of consumer discretionary spending could reduce our sales and harm our business. These economic and market conditions, combined with continuing difficulties in the credit markets and the resulting pressures on liquidity, may also place a number of our key retail customers under financial stress, which would increase our credit risk and potential bad debt exposure.\nThe success of our business also depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Our failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and lawn and garden and pet care needs could adversely affect the demand for our products and our profitability.\nInflation, deflation, economic uncertainty and other adverse macro-economic conditions may harm our business.\nOur revenues and margins are dependent on various economic factors, including rates of inflation or deflation, energy costs, consumer attitudes toward discretionary spending, currency fluctuations, and other macro-economic factors which may impact levels of consumer spending. If we are unable to pass through rising input costs and raise the price of our products, or consumer confidence continues to weaken, we may experience gross margin declines.\nSupply disruptions in pet birds and small animals may negatively impact our sales.\nThe federal government and many state governments have increased restrictions on the importation of pet birds and the supply of small animals. These restrictions have resulted in reduced availability of new pet birds and animals and thus reduced demand for pet bird and small animal food and supplies. If these restrictions become more severe, our future sales of these products would likely suffer, which would negatively impact our profitability. In addition, some countries have experienced outbreaks of avian flu. While the number of cases worldwide has declined, a significant outbreak in the United States would reduce demand for our pet and wild bird food and negatively impact our financial results.\nOur lawn and garden sales are highly seasonal and subject to adverse weather.\nBecause our lawn and garden products are used primarily in the spring and summer, the Garden business is seasonal. In fiscal 2015, approximately 66% of our Garden segment\u2019s net sales and 58% of our total net sales occurred during our second and third fiscal quarters. Substantially all of the Garden segment\u2019s operating income is generated in this period. Our working capital needs and our borrowings generally peak in our second fiscal quarter, because we are generating lower revenues while incurring expenses in preparation for the spring selling season. If cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility are ever insufficient to meet our seasonal needs or if cash flow generated during the spring and summer is insufficient to repay our borrowings on a timely basis, this seasonality could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBecause demand for lawn and garden products is significantly influenced by weather, particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season, our results of operations and cash flow could also be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures, heavy rains, water shortages or floods.\nRising energy prices could adversely affect our operating results.\nDuring fiscal 2012, energy prices increased substantially, which resulted in increased fuel costs for our businesses and increased raw materials costs for many of our branded products. Energy prices have significantly declined since then. Rising energy prices in the future could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both of which would reduce our sales and operating income.\nWe depend on a few customers for a significant portion of our business.\nWal*Mart, our largest customer, accounted for approximately 16% of our net sales in fiscal 2015, 17% of our net sales in fiscal 2014 and 16% in fiscal 2013. Lowe\u2019s accounted for approximately 8% of our net sales in fiscal 2015, 7% in fiscal 2014 and 8% in fiscal 2013. Home Depot accounted for approximately 7% of our net sales in fiscal 2015, 8% in fiscal 2014 and 8% in fiscal 2013. In addition, PetSmart and PETCO are also significant customers, and together with Wal*Mart, Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot, accounted for approximately 40% of our net sales in fiscal 2015, 41% in fiscal 2014 and 43% in fiscal 2013. The market shares of many of these key retailers have increased and may continue to increase in future years.\nThe loss of, or significant adverse change in, our relationship with any of these key retailers could cause our net sales, income from operations and cash flow to decline. The loss of, or reduction in, orders from any significant customer, losses arising from customer disputes regarding shipments, fees, merchandise condition or related matters, or our inability to collect accounts receivable from any major customer could reduce our income from operations and cash flow.\nWe may be adversely affected by trends in the retail industry.\nWith the growing trend towards retail trade consolidation, we are increasingly dependent upon key retailers whose leverage is growing. Our business may be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retailers, such as inventory destocking, limitations on access to shelf space, price demands and other conditions. In addition, retailers continue to more closely manage inventory levels and make purchases on a \u201cjust-in-time\u201d basis. This requires us to shorten our lead time for production in certain cases and to more closely anticipate demand, which could in the future require the carrying of additional inventories and an increase in our working capital and related financing requirements. This shift to \u201cjust-in-time\u201d can also cause retailers to delay purchase orders, which can cause a shift in sales from quarter to quarter. Decisions to move in or out of a market category by leading retailers can also have a significant impact on our business.\nA significant deterioration in the financial condition of one of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability and cash flow. We continually monitor and evaluate the credit status of our customers and attempt to adjust sales terms as appropriate. Despite these efforts, a bankruptcy filing or liquidation by a key customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in the future.\nIssues with products may lead to product liability, personal injury or property damage claims, recalls, withdrawals, replacements of products, regulatory actions by governmental authorities that could divert resources, affect business operations, decrease sales, increase costs, and put us at a competitive disadvantage, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, issues with products that may lead to product liability, recalls, withdrawals, replacements of products, or regulatory actions by governmental authorities. Product recalls or other governmental regulatory action directed at product sales could result in increased governmental scrutiny, reputational harm, reduced demand by consumers for our products, decreased willingness by retailer customers to purchase or provide marketing support for those products, unavailability or increased\ncost of insurance, or additional safety and testing requirements. Such results could divert development and management resources, adversely affect our business operations, decrease sales, increase legal fees and other costs, and put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other manufacturers not affected by similar issues with products, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nCompetition in our industries may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy, increase our profitability or maintain relationships with existing customers.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries, which have experienced increased consolidation in recent years. We compete against numerous other companies, some of which are more established in their industries and have substantially greater revenue and resources than we do. Our products compete against national and regional products and private label products produced by various suppliers. Our largest competitors in the Pet segment are Spectrum Brands and Hartz Mountain, and our largest competitors in the Garden segment are Scotts and Spectrum Brands.\nTo compete effectively, among other things, we must:\n\u2022\ndevelop and grow brands with leading market positions;\n\u2022\ngrow market share;\n\u2022\nmaintain and expand our relationships with key retailers;\n\u2022\ncontinually develop innovative new products that appeal to consumers;\n\u2022\nimplement effective marketing and sales promotion programs;\n\u2022\nmaintain strict quality standards;\n\u2022\ndeliver products on a reliable basis at competitive prices; and\n\u2022\neffectively integrate acquired companies.\nCompetition could lead to lower sales volumes, price reductions, reduced profits, losses, or loss of market share. Our inability to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur acquisition strategy involves a number of risks.\nWe are regularly engaged in acquisition discussions with other companies and anticipate that one or more potential acquisition opportunities, including those that would be material, may become available in the near future. If and when appropriate acquisition opportunities become available, we intend to pursue them actively. Acquisitions involve a number of special risks, including:\n\u2022\nfailure of the acquired business to achieve expected results, as well as the potential impairment of the acquired assets if operating results decline after an acquisition;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain key personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nadditional financing, if necessary and available, which could increase leverage and costs, dilute equity, or both;\n\u2022\nthe potential negative effect on our financial statements from the increase in goodwill and other intangibles;\n\u2022\nthe high cost and expenses of identifying, negotiating and completing acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nrisks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities.\nThese risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have faced, and expect to continue to face, intense competition for acquisition candidates, which may limit our ability to make acquisitions and may lead to higher acquisition prices. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify, acquire or manage profitably additional businesses or to integrate successfully any acquired businesses into our existing business without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial difficulties. In future acquisitions, we also could incur additional indebtedness or pay consideration in excess of fair value, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or other long-term assets become impaired, we will be required to record impairment charges, which may be significant.\nA significant portion of our long-term assets consists of goodwill and other intangible assets recorded as a result of past acquisitions. We do not amortize goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, but rather review them for impairment on a periodic basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. We consider whether circumstances or conditions exist which suggest that the carrying value of our goodwill and other long-lived intangible assets might be impaired. If such circumstances or conditions exist, further steps are required to determine whether the carrying value of each of the individual assets exceeds its fair value. If analysis indicates that an individual asset\u2019s carrying value does exceed its fair value, we would record a loss equal to the excess of the individual asset\u2019s carrying value over its fair value.\nThe steps required by GAAP entail significant amounts of judgment and subjectivity. Events and changes in circumstances that may indicate that there may be an impairment and that interim impairment testing is necessary include, but are not limited to: competitive conditions; the impact of the economic environment on our customer base and on broad market conditions that drive valuation considerations by market participants; our internal expectations with regard to future revenue growth and the assumptions we make when performing impairment reviews; a significant decrease in the market value of our assets; a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which our assets are used; a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect our assets; and significant changes in the cash flows associated with an asset. As a result of such circumstances, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or other long-term assets is determined. Any such impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nDuring fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we performed evaluations of the fair value of our indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks. Our expected revenues were based on our future operating plan and market growth or decline estimates for future years. In fiscal 2015, we recognized a $7.3 million non-cash impairment charge related to certain indefinite-lived intangible assets in our Pet Segment as a result of increased competition in the marketplace and an expected decline in the volume of sales. The fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded the remaining $15.0 million carrying value at September 26, 2015. No impairment was indicated during our fiscal 2014 or 2013 analysis of our indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks.\nOur goodwill is associated with one of the reporting units within our Pet segment. In connection with our annual goodwill impairment testing performed during fiscal 2015, the first step of such testing indicated that the fair value of our reporting segments exceeded their carrying value by more than 10%, and accordingly, no further testing of goodwill was required. During fiscal 2014, the reporting unit\u2019s operating income declined approximately 50% from the comparable fiscal 2013 period. In connection with our annual goodwill impairment testing performed during fiscal 2014, the first step of such testing indicated that the fair value of our reporting segments exceeded their carrying value by more than 10%, and accordingly, no further testing of goodwill was required.\nWe continue to implement an enterprise resource planning information technology system.\nIn fiscal 2005, we began incurring costs associated with designing and implementing SAP, a new company-wide enterprise resource planning (ERP) software system with the objective of gradually migrating to the new system. This new system replaces numerous accounting and financial reporting systems, most of which were obtained in connection with business acquisitions. To date, we have reduced the number of ERP systems from 26 to 7. Capital expenditures for our new enterprise resource planning software system for fiscal 2016 and beyond will depend upon the pace of conversion for those remaining legacy systems. If the implementation is not executed successfully, we could experience business interruptions. If we do not complete the implementation of the project timely and successfully, we may experience, among other things, additional costs associated with completing this project and a delay in our ability to improve existing operations, support future growth and enable us to take advantage of new applications and technologies. All of this may also result in a distraction of management\u2019s time, diverting their attention from our operations and strategy.\nOur inability to protect our trademarks and any other proprietary rights may have a significant, negative impact on our business.\nWe consider our trademarks to be of significant importance in our business. Although we devote resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks, we cannot assure you that the actions we have taken or will take in the future will be adequate to prevent violation of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others or prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as an alleged violation of their trademarks and proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that future litigation will not be necessary to enforce our trademarks or proprietary rights or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement or the rights of others. Any future litigation of this type could result in adverse determinations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our inability to use our trademarks and other proprietary rights could also harm our business and sales through reduced demand for our products and reduced revenues.\nSome of the products that we manufacture and distribute require governmental permits and also subject us to potential environmental liabilities.\nSome of the products that we manufacture and distribute are subject to regulation by federal, state, foreign and local authorities. Environmental health and safety laws and regulations are often complex and are subject to change. Environmental health and safety laws and regulations may affect us by restricting the manufacture, sale or use of our products or regulating their disposal. Regulatory or legislative changes may cause future increases in our operating costs or otherwise affect operations. There is no assurance that in the future we may not be adversely affected by such laws or regulations, incur increased operating costs in complying with such regulations or not be subject to claims for personal injury, property damages or governmental enforcement. In addition, due to the nature of our operations and the frequently changing nature of environmental compliance standards and technology, we cannot predict with any certainty that future material capital expenditures will not be required.\nIn addition to operational standards, environmental laws also impose obligations on various entities to clean up contaminated properties or to pay for the cost of such remediation, often upon parties that did not actually cause the contamination. Accordingly, we may become liable, either contractually or by operation of law, for remediation costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by us, or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to our ownership or operation of the property. With our extensive acquisition history, we have acquired a number of manufacturing and distribution facilities. Given the nature of the past operations conducted by us and others at these properties, there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil or groundwater contamination have been identified, even for those properties where an environmental site assessment has been conducted. Future events, such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement, or the discovery of currently unknown contamination, may give rise to future remediation liabilities that may be material.\nOur business is dependent upon our ability to continue to source products from China.\nWe outsource a significant amount of our manufacturing requirements to third party manufacturers located in China. This international sourcing subjects us to a number of risks, including: the impact on sourcing or manufacturing of public health and contamination risks in China; quality control issues; social and political disturbances and instability; export duties, import controls, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers; shipping and transportation problems; and fluctuations in currency values. Because we rely on Chinese third party manufacturers for a substantial portion of our product needs, any disruption in our relationships with these manufacturers could adversely affect our operations.\nThe products that we manufacture and distribute could expose us to product liability claims.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks in the manufacture and distribution of certain of our products. Although we generally seek to insure against such risks, there can be no assurance that such coverage is adequate or that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms. A successful product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on us and could prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially reasonable terms.\nDeterioration in operating results could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness or impact our ability to refinance our debt on favorable terms as it matures.\nWe have, and we will continue to have, a significant amount of indebtedness. As of September 26, 2015, we had total indebtedness of approximately $400 million. This level of indebtedness and future borrowing needs could have material adverse consequences for our business, including:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the terms of our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other business activities;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse industry conditions, including unfavorable weather conditions or commodity price increases;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds at reasonable rates, if at all.\nIn addition, since a portion of our debt commitments bear interest at variable rates, an increase in interest rates or interest rate margins as defined under the credit agreement will create higher debt service requirements, which would adversely affect our cash flow.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.\nOur business employs systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, employees, suppliers and others, including personal identification information. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly-evolving types of cyber attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our customers and suppliers, or others who have entrusted us with information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. In addition, data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including\nbreach by us or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. Any compromise or breach of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.\nWe do not presently expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock or Class A common stock and currently do not intend to do so. Provisions of our credit facility and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes restrict our ability to pay cash dividends. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to limitations under applicable law and contractual restrictions, and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock or Class A common stock that could dilute the value and market price of your stock.\nWe may decide or be required to issue, including upon the exercise of any outstanding stock options, or in connection with any acquisition made by us, additional shares of our common stock or Class A common stock that could dilute the value of your common stock or Class A common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock or Class A common stock.\nOur Chairman, through his holdings of our Class B common stock, exercises effective control of the Company, which may discourage potential acquisitions of our business and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock.\nHolders of our Class B common stock are entitled to the lesser of ten votes per share or 49% of the total votes cast, and each share of Class B common stock is convertible at any time into one share of our common stock. Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share owned. Holders of our Class A common stock and Series B preferred stock have no voting rights, except as required by Delaware law.\nAs of November 30, 2015, William E. Brown, our Chairman, beneficially controlled approximately 55% of the voting power of our capital stock. Accordingly, except to the extent that a class vote of the common stock is required by applicable law, he can effectively control all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of our directors, and can exert substantial control over our management and policies. The disproportionate voting rights of our common stock and Class B common stock and Mr. Brown\u2019s substantial holdings of Class B common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and Class A common stock. Also, such disproportionate voting rights and Mr. Brown\u2019s controlling interest may make us a less attractive target for a takeover than we otherwise might be, or render more difficult or discourage a merger proposal, tender offer or proxy contest, even if such actions were favored by our other stockholders, which could thereby deprive holders of common stock or Class A common stock of an opportunity to sell their shares for a \u201ctake-over\u201d premium.\nWe have authorized the issuance of shares of common stock, Class A common stock and preferred stock, which may discourage potential acquisitions of our business and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our Class A common stock.\nPursuant to our Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 80,000,000 shares of our common stock, 100,000,000 shares of our nonvoting Class A common stock and up to 1,000,000 additional shares of preferred stock without seeking the approval or consent of our stockholders, unless required by the NASDAQ Global Market. Although the issuance of the nonvoting Class A common stock would not dilute the voting rights of the existing stockholders, it would have a dilutive effect on the economic interest of currently outstanding shares of common stock and Class B common stock similar to the dilutive effect of subsequent issuances of ordinary common stock. The issuance of the preferred\nstock could, depending on the rights and privileges designated by the board with respect to any particular series, have a dilutive effect on the voting interests of the common stock and Class B common stock and the economic interests of our common stock, Class A common stock and Class B common stock. In addition, the disproportionate voting rights of our common stock, preferred stock, Class B common stock and Class A common stock, and the ability of the board to issue stock to persons friendly to current management, may make us a less attractive target for a takeover than we otherwise might be or render more difficult or discourage a merger proposal, tender offer or proxy contest, even if such actions were favored by our common stockholders, which could thereby deprive holders of common stock of an opportunity to sell their shares for a \u201ctake-over\u201d premium.", "PERMNO": 91815, "SIC": 5140, "TIC": "CENTA"}
