RISK FACTORS\nInvestment in our common stock involves significant risk. You should carefully consider the information described in the following risk factors, together with the other information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock. If any of the events or circumstances described in these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or a part of your investment in our common stock. Moreover, the risks described below are not the only ones that we face.\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives or may adversely affect our business, clinical and commercialization activities, the manufacturing of our product candidates, intellectual property, third-party relationships, competition factors, product and environmental liability, and common stock. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risks related to:\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\u25cf the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on our business and operations;\n\u25cf substantial additional funding is needed to complete the development of our product candidates;\n\u25cf the Company has incurred significant losses and may never be profitable;\n\u25cf the occurrence of security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, and other cyber incidents or undesirable cyber activity related to our, or our third party vendor\u2019s systems and data;\n\u25cf we may not have adequate personnel and may not be able to attract or retain personnel needed to develop our products;\nRisks Related to Clinical and Commercialization Activities\n\u25cf our success depends upon the viability of our product candidates, all of which require regulatory approval to commercialize and we cannot be certain any of them will receive regulatory approval to be commercialized;\n\u25cf delays in commencement, enrollment, and completion of clinical testing could result in increased costs to us and delay or limit our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates;\n\u25cf our exosome technologies are unproven in their ability to achieve sufficient biological activity or scale in development to date;\n\u25cf product candidates can fail to meet their efficacy endpoints at any time during the clinical development process, which would likely make them ineligible for becoming commercial products;\n\u25cf we may not be able to use our facilities to manufacture product for use in our Phase III trial of CAP-1002 for DMD;\nRisks Related to the Manufacturing of our Product Candidates\n\u25cf the manufacturing of our product candidates is heavily reliant on supply chain requirements including the availability of donor hearts and other raw materials that are critical for the manufacturing of our product candidates;\n\u25cf we may need to rely upon third party manufacturers for the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities for later-stage clinical trials and for ultimate commercialization;\n\u25cf we may not have adequate manufacturing facilities required for any scale-up of manufacturing which may be required in the future;\n\u25cf we may not be able to replicate our manufacturing processes;\n\u25cf we may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations;\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n\u25cf our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf potential challenges to the enforceability or scope of our intellectual property;\n\u25cf potential claims from third parties that we are infringing their patents or other intellectual property rights;\nRisks Related to Our Relationships with Third Parties\n\u25cf we depend on our relationships with our licensors and collaborators and there is no guarantee that such relationships will continue;\n\u25cf we will depend on the ability of Nippon Shinyaku to perform according to the terms of the NS Distribution Agreement and all applicable laws, and to successfully commercialize our lead product CAP-1002 in DMD;\nRisks Related to Competitive Factors\n\u25cf our products will likely face intense competition;\n\u25cf any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could limit the revenue that we will generate from their sales, if any;\nRisks Related to Product and Environmental Liability\n\u25cf our products may expose us to potential product liability;\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\u25cf we expect that our stock price will continue to fluctuate significantly; and\n\u25cf we have never paid dividends and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe need substantial additional funding before we can complete the development of our product candidates. If we are unable to obtain such additional capital, we will be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development and clinical programs and may not have the capital required to otherwise operate our business.\nDeveloping biopharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and establishing manufacturing capabilities, is expensive. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $34.9 million. Additionally, under the terms of our Distribution Agreement with Nippon Shinyaku, we expect to receive a $30.0 million upfront payment. We have not generated any revenues from the commercial sale of products. We will not be able to generate any product revenues until, and only if, we receive approval to sell our drug candidates from the FDA or other regulatory authorities.\nFrom inception, we have financed our operations through public and private sales of our equity securities, grants from the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and the Department of Defense, or DoD, a loan commitment and grant award from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, or CIRM and through various partnership agreements. As we have not generated any revenue from commercial sales to date and we do not expect to generate revenue for several years, if ever, we will need to raise substantial additional capital in order to fund our general corporate activities and to fund our research and development, including our ongoing clinical trials and plans for new clinical trials and product development.\nWe may seek to raise additional funds through various potential sources, such as equity and debt financings, or through strategic collaborations and license agreements. We can give no assurances that we will be able to secure such additional sources of funds to support our operations or, if such funds are available to us, that such additional financing will be sufficient to meet our needs. Moreover, to the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience additional significant dilution, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nIf we are unable to raise sufficient funds to support our current and planned operations, we may elect to discontinue certain of our ongoing activities or programs. The inability to raise additional funds could also prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities to pursue promising new or existing programs in the future.\nOur forecasts regarding our beliefs in the sufficiency of our financial resources to support our current and planned operations are forward-looking statements and involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf the scope, rate of progress, cost and results of our research and development activities, especially our CAP-1002 and exosomes programs;\n\u25cf the next steps in the development of our Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, program, which includes a Phase III clinical trial for our CAP-1002 product candidate for DMD;\n\u25cf the availability of funding from government programs including the NIH, DoD, and CIRM, if applicable;\n\u25cf the costs of developing adequate manufacturing processes and facilities;\n\u25cf the costs associated with and timing of regulatory approval;\n\u25cf the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf the costs and risks involved in conducting clinical trials and manufacturing operations in the U.S. and internationally;\n\u25cf the effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u25cf the terms and timing of any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u25cf the cost and timing of technology transfer for, and completion of, clinical and commercial-scale outsourced manufacturing activities; and\n\u25cf the costs of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, as applicable, for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval.\nWe have a history of net losses, and we expect losses to continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, a number of factors may cause our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nWe have a history of net losses, expect to continue to incur substantial net losses for the foreseeable future, and may never achieve or maintain profitability. Our operations to date have been primarily limited to organizing and staffing our company, developing our technology, and undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates. We have not yet obtained regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. Specifically, our financial condition and operating results have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include the following factors:\n\u25cf our need for substantial additional capital to fund our trials and development programs;\n\u25cf delays in the commencement, enrollment, and timing of clinical testing;\n\u25cf the viability of CAP-1002 as a potential product candidate and its development through all stages of clinical development;\n\u25cf the viability of our exosome technologies as potential product candidates and the advancement of our exosome technologies through all stages of its preclinical and clinical development;\n\u25cf any delays in regulatory review and approval of our product candidates in clinical development;\n\u25cf our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, within and outside the United States;\n\u25cf potential side effects of our current or future products and product candidates that could delay or prevent commercialization or cause an approved treatment drug to be taken off the market;\n\u25cf market acceptance of our product candidates;\n\u25cf our ability to establish an effective sales and marketing infrastructure once our products are commercialized, as necessary or to establish partnerships with other companies who have greater sales and marketing capabilities;\n\u25cf the ability of our distribution partner, Nippon Shinyaku, to successfully market and sell our CAP-1002 product if and to the extent it is approved;\n\u25cf our ability to establish or maintain collaborations, licensing or other arrangements, including strategic partnerships for CAP-1002 outside of DMD and our exosomes technologies;\n\u25cf our ability and third parties\u2019 abilities to obtain and protect intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf competition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u25cf guidelines and recommendations of therapies published by various organizations;\n\u25cf the ability of patients to obtain coverage of, or sufficient reimbursement for, our product candidates;\n\u25cf our ability to maintain adequate insurance policies;\n\u25cf our ability to successfully manufacture our product candidates in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis to meet clinical trial and potential commercial demand;\n\u25cf our dependency on third parties to formulate and manufacture our product candidates;\n\u25cf our ability to maintain our current manufacturing facility;\n\u25cf our ability to build or secure new manufacturing facilities and achieve and maintain current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and obtain required certifications as necessary;\n\u25cf costs related to and outcomes of potential intellectual property litigation;\n\u25cf compliance with obligations under intellectual property licenses with third parties;\n\u25cf our ability to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure;\n\u25cf our ability to adequately support future growth;\n\u25cf if our products are approved for commercial sale, the ability to secure reimbursement for our products;\n\u25cf our ability to attract and retain key personnel to manage our business effectively; and\n\u25cf the ability of members of our senior management who have limited experience in managing a public company to manage our business and operations.\nThe Company\u2019s technology is not yet proven and each of our product candidates is still in clinical or preclinical development.\nThe Company\u2019s product candidates, CAP-1002 and our exosome technologies, are in development and each requires further and, in some cases, extensive clinical testing before it may be approved by the FDA, or another regulatory authority in a jurisdiction outside the United States, which could take several years to complete, if ever. The Company\u2019s failure to establish the efficacy of its technologies would have a material adverse effect on the Company. We cannot predict with any certainty the results of such clinical testing, including the results of our planned Phase III trial of our CAP-1002 product candidate for DMD. Additionally, we cannot predict with any certainty if, or when, we might commence any additional clinical trials of our product candidates, whether we will be able to secure additional partners, or whether our current trials will yield sufficient data to permit us to proceed with additional clinical development and ultimately submit an application for regulatory approval of our product candidates in the United States or abroad, or whether such applications will be accepted by the appropriate regulatory agencies. We are also unable to predict whether our preclinical studies of our exosomes products will result in a viable clinical development program.\nOur business depends entirely on the successful development and commercialization of our product candidates. We currently have no products approved for sale and generate no revenues from sales of any products, and we may never be able to develop a marketable product.\nOur product candidates will require additional clinical development, evaluation of clinical, preclinical and manufacturing activities, marketing approval in multiple jurisdictions, substantial investment and significant marketing efforts before we generate any revenues from product sales. We are not permitted to market or promote our product candidates before we receive marketing approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and we may never receive such marketing approvals.\nThe success of our product candidates will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u25cf successful and timely completion of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf initiation and successful patient enrollment and completion of additional clinical trials on a timely basis;\n\u25cf the impact of COVID-19 on our operations, ability to conduct clinical trials and on the ability of our regulators to review and approve or authorize our products;\n\u25cf our ability to demonstrate our products\u2019 safety, tolerability and efficacy to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority for emergency use authorization (EUA) or marketing approval;\n\u25cf timely receipt of an EUA or marketing approval for our products;\n\u25cf obtaining and maintaining patent protection, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;\n\u25cf successfully defending and enforcing our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u25cf avoiding and successfully defending against any claims that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated any intellectual property of any third party;\n\u25cf the performance of our current and future collaborators, if any;\n\u25cf the extent of, and our ability to timely complete, any required post-marketing approval commitments imposed by FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf successfully developing a companion diagnostic test on a timely and cost effective basis, if required;\n\u25cf establishment of supply arrangements with third-parties for raw materials and drug product supplies and potential manufacturers who are able to manufacture clinical trial and commercial quantities of drug substance and drug products and to develop, validate and maintain a commercially viable manufacturing process that is compliant with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, at a scale sufficient to meet anticipated demand and over time enable us to reduce our cost of manufacturing;\n\u25cf establishment of scaled production arrangements with third-party manufacturers to obtain finished products that are compliant with cGMP and appropriately packaged for sale;\n\u25cf successful launch of commercial sales following any EUA or marketing approval;\n\u25cf a continued acceptable safety profile following any EUA or marketing approval;\n\u25cf commercial acceptance by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u25cf the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities;\n\u25cf the availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of alternative and competing treatments; and\n\u25cf our ability to compete with other therapies.\nWe do not have complete control over many of these factors, including certain aspects of clinical development and the regulatory submission process, potential threats to our intellectual property rights and the manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sales efforts of any future collaborator. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will ever be able to generate revenue through the sale of our products. If we are not successful in marketing or commercializing our products, or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nBusiness disruptions such as natural disasters, widespread infectious diseases or pandemics could seriously harm our future revenues and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur corporate headquarters and our manufacturing and research facilities are located in San Diego and in the greater Los Angeles, California area, a region known for seismic activity, as well as being susceptible to drought and fires. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, flood or fire, occurring at our headquarters or manufacturing facilities, or at the facilities of any third-party manufacturer or vendor, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, outbreaks of viruses, infectious diseases or pandemics (including, for example, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)), terrorist acts or acts of war targeted at the United States, and specifically in the California region, could cause damage or disruption to us, our employees, facilities, contractors and collaborators, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe coronavirus outbreak could adversely impact our business.\nAn epidemic or pandemic disease outbreak, including COVID-19, could severely disrupt our operations or the operations of third parties that we depend on, including any third-party contract manufacturer, our CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In December 2019, it was first reported that there had been an outbreak of COVID-19, in China. COVID-19 has since spread globally and while cases and hospitalization are currently on the decline in the US, there can be no assurances they will not continue at the current rate or increase in the future especially in light of the number of variants that are emerging across the world. Governments in the United States and elsewhere have taken and are continuing to take measures to slow the spread of COVID-19.\nIf COVID-19 continues to spread and further variants emerge, we may experience disruptions that could severely impact our business, including:\n\u25cf delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials and having patients complete their assessments in accordance with the clinical protocol;\n\u25cf restrictions preventing trial investigators, patients or other critical staff from traveling to our trial sites;\n\u25cf diversion of healthcare resources to address COVID-19, which could limit the availability of medical facilities for our clinical trials;\n\u25cf forced closures, or reductions in operations, at our facilities or the facilities of third parties with whom we do business;\n\u25cf supply chain disruptions which could have a material adverse effect on the availability or cost of materials for our product candidates; and\n\u25cf disruptions to our workforce, or the workforces of third parties with whom we do business, caused by sickness, travel restrictions or quarantines.\nAdditionally, disruptions at the at FDA, the EMA and other regulators, caused by global health concerns, including the COVID-19 pandemic, including delays in inspections of clinical trial or manufacturing sites required as part of the application review process, could result in delays of reviews and approvals of our product candidate or our proposed clinical trials. For example, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 10, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to postpone most inspections of foreign manufacturing facilities and products inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities through April 2020. On March 18, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to temporarily postpone routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities and provided guidance regarding the conduct of clinical trials. On July 10, 2020, the FDA announced that it is working toward the goal of restarting on-site inspections it deems to be \u201cmission critical.\u201d In May 2021, the FDA updated its guidance, first published in August 2020, clarifying how it intends to conduct inspections during the COVID-19 pandemic, including how it plans to determine which inspections are \u201cmission critical.\u201d Additionally, on April 14, 2021, the FDA issued a guidance document in which the FDA described its plans to conduct voluntary remote interactive evaluations of certain drug manufacturing facilities and clinical research sites. According to the guidance, the FDA intends to request such remote interactive evaluations in situations where an in-person inspection would not be prioritized, deemed mission-critical, or where direct inspection is otherwise limited by travel restrictions, but where the FDA determines that remote evaluation would still be appropriate. The FDA intends to use this risk-based assessment system to identify the categories of regulatory activity that can occur within a given geographic area, ranging from mission critical inspections to resumption of all regulatory activities. Regulatory authorities outside the United States may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear how FDA\u2019s and other health agencies\u2019 policies and guidance will impact any inspections of our facilities, including our clinical trial sites.\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 continues to evolve and its ultimate impact on our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Any of the disruptions listed above, or other disruptions caused by new developments associated with the COVID-19 outbreak or other outbreak could severely impact our business.\nA breakdown or breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems and data, as well as the information technology systems and data of our third-party vendors, especially if we expand our clinical trials and therefore our databases of patient information. Our or our third-party vendors\u2019 computer systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and random attack. Likewise, data privacy or security breaches by individuals authorized to access our information technology systems or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us, our patients, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity. While we continue to build and improve our information systems and infrastructure and believe we have taken appropriate security measures to minimize these risks to our data and information technology systems, we intend to defend against and respond to data security incidents, and there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems, or adequately contain and mitigate risks from a data security incident, that could adversely affect our business.\nOur internal computer systems, or those used by our CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches.\nWe utilize and rely on services of third parties to perform services in connection with our clinical trials, which services involve the collection, use, storage and analysis of personal health information. While we receive assurances from these vendors that their services are compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and other applicable privacy and cybersecurity laws, there can be no assurance that such third parties will comply with applicable laws or regulations. Non-compliance by such vendors or weaknesses in their information security programs may result in liability for us which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and future clinical research organizations, or CROs, and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses and unauthorized access. While we have not experienced any such material system failure or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed.\nIf we achieve our near-term product development milestones, we may not be able to manage any subsequent growth.\nShould we achieve our near-term product development milestones, of which no assurance can be given, our long-term viability will depend upon the expansion of our operations and the effective management of our growth, which will place a significant strain on our management and on our administrative, operational and financial resources, especially if we expand our business and operations internationally. To manage this growth, we may need to expand our facilities, augment our operational, financial and management systems and hire and train additional qualified personnel. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business would be harmed.\nRisks Related to Clinical and Commercialization Activities\nOur success depends upon the viability of our product candidates and we cannot be certain any of them will receive regulatory approval to be commercialized.\nWe will need FDA approval to market and sell any of our product candidates in the United States and approvals from FDA-equivalent regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions to commercialize our product candidates in those jurisdictions. In order to obtain FDA approval of any of our product candidates, we must submit to the FDA a new drug application, or NDA, or a biologics license application, or BLA, demonstrating that the product candidate is safe for humans and effective for its intended use. This demonstration requires significant research and animal testing, which are referred to as preclinical studies, as well as human testing, which are referred to as clinical trials. Satisfaction of the FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements typically takes many years, depends upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product candidate, and requires substantial resources for research, development, testing and manufacturing. We cannot predict whether our research and clinical approaches will result in drugs that the FDA considers safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. The FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process and may require us to conduct additional preclinical and clinical testing or to perform post-marketing studies. The approval process may also be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation, administrative action or changes in FDA policy that occur prior to or during our regulatory review.\nEven if we comply with all FDA requests, the FDA may ultimately reject one or more of our NDAs or BLAs, as applicable. We cannot be sure that we will ever obtain regulatory clearance for our product candidates. Failure to obtain FDA approval of any of our product candidates will reduce our number of potentially salable products, if any, and, therefore, corresponding product revenues, and will have a material and adverse impact on our business.\nAs the results of earlier preclinical studies or clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, any product candidate we advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive regulatory approval.\nEven if our preclinical studies and clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support the claims of our product candidates. Positive results in preclinical testing and early clinical trials do not ensure that results from later clinical trials will also be positive, and we cannot be sure that the results of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and preclinical testing.\nOur clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. This failure would cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of other product candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay or cause us to refrain from the filing of our NDAs and/or BLAs with the FDA and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues. In addition, our clinical trials to date involve small patient populations. Because of the small sample size, the results of these clinical trials may not be indicative of future results.\nDespite the results reported in earlier clinical trials for our product candidates, we do not know whether any Phase II, Phase III or other clinical trial which we may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market our product candidates. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including those with greater resources and experience, have suffered significant setbacks in Phase II or Phase III clinical trials, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical trials.\nOur exosome technologies are based on a novel therapeutic approach which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of development and of subsequently obtaining regulatory approval, if at all.\nOur exosome technologies involve a relatively new therapeutic approach which will face both clinical and regulatory challenges. To date, no products based on exosomes have been approved in the United States or the European Union. It is therefore difficult to accurately predict the developmental challenges we may face for our exosome technologies as they proceed through preclinical studies and clinical trials. In addition, because we have only conducted preclinical studies with our exosome technologies, we have not yet been able to assess their safety in humans, and there may be short-term or long-term effects from treatment with our exosomes that we cannot predict at this time. Also, animal models for the indications we may explore may not exist or may be difficult to obtain for our preclinical studies. As a result of these factors, we are unable to predict the time and cost of development of the exosome technologies and we cannot predict whether the application of the exosome technologies, or any similar or competitive exosome technologies, will result in regulatory approval of any products. There can be no assurance that any development problems we experience in the future related to our exosomes or any of our research programs will not cause significant delays or unanticipated costs, or that such development problems can be solved. We may also decide to discontinue exosome development programs if we believe that there is excessive competition in a disease target. Any of these factors may prevent us from completing our preclinical studies or any clinical trials that we may initiate or commercializing any product candidates we may develop on a timely or profitable basis, if at all.\nThe clinical trial requirements of the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and other regulatory authorities and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity and intended use and market of the product candidate. As a result, the regulatory approval process for our exosomes is uncertain and may be more expensive and take longer than the approval process for other product candidates. It is difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for our exosomes in either the United States or the European Union or other regions of the world or how long it will take to commercialize our product candidates, if at all. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential product candidate to market could decrease our ability to generate sufficient product revenue, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely impacted.\nNegative developments in the field of exosomes could damage public perception of any product candidates that we develop, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for such product candidates.\nExosome-based therapeutics and vaccines are novel and unproven therapies which may not gain the acceptance of the public, patients or the medical community. To date, efforts by others to leverage natural exosomes have generally demonstrated an inability to generate exosomes with predictable biologically active properties or to manufacture exosomes at suitable scale to treat more than a small number of patients. Our success will depend on our ability to demonstrate that our exosome technologies can overcome these challenges.\nAdditionally, our success will depend upon physicians who specialize in the treatment of diseases targeted by our exosomes prescribing treatments that involve the use of our product candidates in lieu of, or in addition to, existing treatments with which they are more familiar and for which greater clinical data may be available. Adverse events in clinical trials of our exosomes or in clinical trials of others developing similar products and the resulting publicity, as well as any other adverse events in the field of exosome therapeutics, could result in a decrease in demand for any products that we may develop. These events could also result in the suspension, discontinuation, or clinical hold of, or modification to, our clinical trials. Any future negative developments in the field of exosomes and their use as therapies could also result in greater governmental regulation, stricter labeling requirements and potential regulatory delays in the testing or approvals of our exosomes or other potential future product candidates. Any increased scrutiny could delay or increase the costs of obtaining marketing approval for our exosomes or any other product candidates which we may develop in the future.\nAdvancing product candidates based on our exosome platform as novel products creates significant challenges for us, including:\n\u25cf obtaining marketing approval, as obtaining an EUA or regulatory approval of such a product candidate from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities has never been done before;\n\u25cf educating medical personnel regarding the potential efficacy and safety benefits, as well as the challenges, of incorporating our product candidates, if approved, into treatment regimens; and\n\u25cf establishing the sales and marketing capabilities to gain market acceptance, if approved.\nWe may not be able to file INDs to commence additional clinical trials on the timelines we expect, and even if we are able to do so, the FDA may not permit us to proceed.\nWe hope to file additional investigational new drug applications, or INDs, over the next several years, including with respect to our exosome technologies in one or more indications. However, the timing of our filing of these INDs is primarily dependent on receiving further data from our preclinical studies, having sufficient processes in place in connection with the manufacturing of the exosomes and the availability of necessary funding for any potential clinical trial.\nWe cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing further clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that result in the suspension or termination of such clinical trials. Any IND we submit could be denied by the FDA or the FDA could place any future investigation of ours on clinical hold until we provide additional information, either before or after clinical trials are initiated. Additionally, even if such regulatory authorities agree with the design and implementation of the clinical trial set forth in an IND or clinical trial application, we cannot guarantee that such regulatory authorities will not change their requirements in the future. The FDA may also impose clinical holds at any time before or during clinical trials due to unacceptable and significant risks to clinical trial subjects or non-compliance with FDA requirements. Unfavorable future trial results or other factors, such as insufficient capital to continue development of a product candidate or program, could also cause us to voluntarily withdraw an effective IND.\nThe Company has limited experience in conducting late-stage clinical trials, which are complex and subject to strict regulatory oversight.\nThe Company has limited late-stage clinical trial experience with respect to its product candidates. The clinical testing process is governed by stringent regulation and is highly complex, costly, time-consuming, and uncertain as to outcome, and pharmaceutical products and products used in the regeneration of tissue may invite particularly close scrutiny and requirements from the FDA and other regulatory bodies. Our failure or the failure of our collaborators to conduct clinical trials successfully or our failure to capitalize on the results of clinical trials for our product candidates would have\na material adverse effect on the Company. If our clinical trials of our product candidates or future product candidates do not sufficiently enroll or produce results necessary to support regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere, or if they show undesirable side effects, we will be unable to commercialize these product candidates.\nTo receive regulatory approval for the commercial sale of our product candidates, we must conduct adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy and safety in humans. Clinical failure can occur at any stage of testing. Our clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical and/or non-clinical testing. In addition, the results of our clinical trials may show that our product candidates are ineffective or may cause undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, resulting in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Furthermore, negative, delayed or inconclusive results may result in:\n\u25cf the withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf the termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u25cf costly litigation arising out of the trials;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u25cf the requirement that additional trials be conducted;\n\u25cf impairment of our business reputation;\n\u25cf loss of revenues; and\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize our product candidates.\nDelays in the commencement, enrollment, and completion of clinical testing could result in increased costs to us and delay or limit our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nDelays in the commencement, enrollment or completion of clinical testing could significantly affect our product development costs. The current pandemic has had an impact on the ability to conduct clinical trials due to inabilities to enroll or even get subjects to complete the trials due to lockdowns, reluctance to travel, limitations set by trial sites and other reasons. We cannot predict how long this will exist and while the hospitalization rates and number of cases seem to be on the decline, there is no assurance that it will not revert to prior critical levels. A clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by the Company, the FDA, or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors. The commencement and completion of clinical trials require us to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs for the same indication as our product candidates or may otherwise be resource constrained. We may be required to withdraw from a clinical trial as a result of changing standards of care, or we may become ineligible to participate in clinical studies. We do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. The commencement, enrollment and completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, delays related to:\n\u25cf findings in preclinical studies;\n\u25cf reaching agreements on acceptable terms with prospective CROs, vendors and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs, vendors and trial sites;\n\u25cf obtaining regulatory clearance to commence a clinical trial;\n\u25cf complying with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or term of a clinical trial, or being required to conduct additional trials before moving on to the next phase of trials;\n\u25cf obtaining institutional review board, or IRB, approval to conduct a clinical trial at numerous prospective sites;\n\u25cf recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including the size of the patient population, nature of trial protocol, meeting the enrollment criteria for our studies, screening failures, the inability of the sites to conduct trial procedures properly, the inability of the sites to devote their resources to the trial, the availability of approved effective treatments for the relevant disease and competition from other clinical trial programs for similar indications;\n\u25cf the impact of COVID-19 on patient screening and patient enrollment;\n\u25cf developing and validating any companion diagnostic to be used in the trial, to the extent we are required to do so;\n\u25cf patients failing to comply with the clinical trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;\n\u25cf clinical trial sites failing to comply with the clinical trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;\n\u25cf addressing any conflicts with new or existing laws or regulations;\n\u25cf the need to add new clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf retaining patients who have initiated their participation in a clinical trial but may be prone to withdraw due to the treatment protocol, lack of efficacy, personal issues, or side effects from the therapy, or who are lost to further follow-up;\n\u25cf manufacturing sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials on a timely basis;\n\u25cf obtaining advice from regulatory authorities regarding the statistical analysis plan to be used to evaluate the clinical trial data or other trial design issues;\n\u25cf demonstrating the bioequivalence of products we manufacture to prior products manufactured by us;\n\u25cf complying with design protocols of any applicable special protocol assessment we receive from the FDA;\n\u25cf severe or unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by patients in a clinical trial;\n\u25cf collecting, analyzing and reporting final data from the clinical trials;\n\u25cf breaches in quality of manufacturing runs that compromise all or some of the doses made; positive results in FDA-required viral testing; karyotypic abnormalities in our cell product; or contamination in our manufacturing facilities, all of which events would necessitate disposal of all cells made from that source;\n\u25cf availability of materials provided by third parties necessary to manufacture our product candidates;\n\u25cf availability of adequate amounts of acceptable tissue for preparation of master cell banks for our products;\n\u25cf requirements to conduct additional trials and studies, and increased expenses associated with the services of the Company\u2019s CROs and other third parties; and\n\u25cf meeting logistical requirements for the delivery of investigational product.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, we or our development partners, if any, may be delayed in obtaining, or may not be able to obtain or maintain, clinical or marketing approval for these product candidates. We may not be able to obtain approval for indications that are as broad as intended, or we may be able to obtain approval only for indications that are entirely different from those indications for which we sought approval.\nChanges in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur, and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes with appropriate regulatory authorities. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for re-examination which may impact the costs, timing, or successful completion of a clinical trial. If we experience delays in the completion of, or if we terminate, our clinical trials, the commercial prospects for our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed or will not be realized. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate. Even if we are able to ultimately commercialize our product candidates, other therapies for the same or similar indications may have been introduced to the market and already established a competitive advantage. Any delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may:\n\u25cf delay commercialization of, and our ability to derive product revenues from, our product candidates;\n\u25cf impose costly procedures on us; or\n\u25cf diminish any competitive advantages that we may otherwise enjoy.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u25cf we may receive feedback from regulatory authorities that requires us to modify the design of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon drug development programs;\n\u25cf the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u25cf our third-party contractors, including our CROs, may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u25cf we, our investigators, or any of the overseeing IRBs or ethics committees might decide to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including non-compliance with\nregulatory requirements, a finding that our product candidates have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u25cf the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u25cf the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate;\n\u25cf regulators may revise the requirements for approving our product candidates, or such requirements may not be as we anticipate; and\n\u25cf any future collaborators that conduct clinical trials may face any of the above issues, and may conduct clinical trials in ways they view as advantageous to them but that are suboptimal for us.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are insufficiently positive to support marketing approval, or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u25cf incur unplanned costs;\n\u25cf be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates or not obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u25cf obtain marketing approval in some countries and not in others;\n\u25cf obtain marketing approval for indications or patient populations that are narrower or more limited in scope than intended or desired;\n\u25cf obtain marketing approval subject to significant use or distribution restrictions or with labeling that includes significant safety warnings, including boxed warnings;\n\u25cf be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n\u25cf have the drug removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nOur drug development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing approvals. We do not know whether clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Furthermore, we rely on third-party CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials, and while we have agreements governing their committed activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance. Significant clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring drugs to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nThe outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results, and the results of our clinical trials may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nWe currently have no products approved for sale and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have marketable drugs. Clinical failure can occur at any stage of clinical development. Clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we or any future collaborators may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or preclinical studies. We will be required to demonstrate with substantial evidence through adequate and well-controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in treating specific conditions in order to obtain marketing approvals for their commercial sale. Success in preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials does not mean that future larger registration clinical trials will be successful because product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities despite having progressed through preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials. Product candidates that have shown promising results in preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials may still suffer significant setbacks in subsequent registration clinical trials. Additionally, the outcome of preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later-stage clinical trials.\nFrom time to time, we may publish or report interim or preliminary data from our clinical trials, once initiated. Interim or preliminary data from clinical trials that we may conduct may not be indicative of the final results of the trial and are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Interim or preliminary data also remain subject to audit and verification\nprocedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the interim or preliminary data. As a result, interim or preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available.\nIn addition, the design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a drug and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. We have limited experience in designing late-stage clinical trials and may be unable to design and conduct a clinical trial to support marketing approval. Further, if our product candidates are found to be unsafe or lack efficacy, we will not be able to obtain marketing approval for them and our business would be harmed. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including those with greater resources and experience than us, have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after obtaining promising results in preclinical studies and earlier clinical trials.\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety and efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial protocols, differences in size and type of the patient populations, differences in and adherence to the dosing regimen and other trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. We do not know whether any clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate consistent or adequate efficacy and safety sufficient to obtain marketing approval to market our product candidates.\nIn the event that an adverse safety issue, clinical hold or other adverse finding occurs in one or more of our clinical trials, once initiated, such event could adversely affect our other clinical trials using the same product candidate. Moreover, there is a relatively limited safety data set for product candidates using an exosome platform. An adverse safety issue or other adverse finding in a clinical trial conducted by a third party with a product candidate similar to ours could adversely affect our clinical trials.\nFurther, our product candidates may not be approved even if they achieve their primary endpoints in Phase 3 clinical trials or registration trials. The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our trial design and our interpretation of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials. In addition, any of these regulatory authorities may change requirements for the approval of a product candidate even after reviewing and providing comments or advice on a protocol for a pivotal clinical trial that has the potential to result in approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. In addition, any of these regulatory authorities may also approve a product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than we request or may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not approve the labeling claims that we believe would be necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval for the commercial sale of any product candidate for a target indication, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, and, with respect to approval in the United States, to the satisfaction of the FDA and elsewhere to the satisfaction of other comparable foreign regulatory authorities, that the product candidate is safe and effective for use for that target indication. There is no assurance that the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities will consider our future clinical trials to be sufficient to serve as the basis for approval of one of our product candidates for any indication. The FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities retain broad discretion in evaluating the results of our clinical trials and in determining whether the results demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and effective. If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials of a product candidate than we expect prior to its approval, we will need substantial additional funds and there is no assurance that the results of any such additional clinical trials will be sufficient for approval.\nThe regulatory pathway for COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines is continually evolving, and may result in unexpected or unforeseen challenges.\nThe speed at which all parties are acting to create and test many therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19 is atypical, and evolving or changing plans or priorities within the FDA or the regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, including changes based on new knowledge of COVID-19 and how the disease affects the human body, and new variants of the virus, may significantly affect the regulatory timeline for further authorizations or approvals. We cannot anticipate or predict with certainty the timelines or regulatory processes that may be required for the development of our COVID-19 therapeutic or potential vaccines that may be developed to fight against variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We may also decide to discontinue exosome development programs if we believe that there is excessive competition in a disease target.\nWe may not be able to obtain Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for CAP-1002 for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, or any other therapies or vaccines for COVID-19, and, even if we do, absent supplemental BLA approval for that indication, such EUA would be revoked when the COVID-19 emergency terminates.\nSection 564 of the FDCA allows the FDA to authorize the shipment of drugs, biological products, or medical devices that either lack required approval, licensure, or clearance (unapproved products), or are approved but are to be used for unapproved ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious diseases or conditions in the event of an emergency declaration by the HHS Secretary.\nOn February 4, 2020, then-HHS Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency for COVID-19, under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360bbb-3(b)(1), justifying the authorization of emergency use of unapproved therapeutic products, or unapproved uses of approved or cleared therapeutic products, to treat COVID-19. This determination was published in the Federal Register on February 7, 2020.\nWhile this emergency declaration is effective, the FDA may authorize the use of an unapproved product or an unapproved use of an approved product if it concludes that:\n\u25cf an agent referred to in the emergency declaration could cause a serious or life-threatening disease or condition;\n\u25cf it is reasonable to believe that the authorized product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing that disease or condition or a serious or life-threatening disease or condition caused by an approved product or a product marketed under an EUA;\n\u25cf the known and potential benefits of the authorized product, when used for that disease or condition, outweigh known and potential risks, taking into consideration the material threat of agents identified in the emergency declaration;\n\u25cf there is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the authorized product for diagnosing, preventing, or treating the relevant disease or condition;\n\u25cf any other criteria prescribed by the FDA is satisfied.\nMedical products that are granted an EUA are only permitted to commercialize their products under the terms and conditions provided in the authorization. The FDCA authorizes FDA to impose such conditions on an EUA as may be necessary to protect the public health. Consequently, postmarketing requirements will vary across EUAs. In addition, FDA has, on occasion, waived requirements for drugs marketed under an EUA.\nGenerally, EUAs for unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved products require that manufacturers distribute factsheets for healthcare providers, addressing significant known and potential benefits and risk, and the extent to which benefits and risks are unknown, and the fact that FDA has authorized emergency use; and, distribution of factsheets for recipients of the product, addressing significant known and potential benefits and risk, and the extent to which benefits and risks are unknown, the option to accept or refuse the product, the consequences of refusing, available alternatives and the fact that FDA has authorized emergency use.\nGenerally, EUAs for unapproved products and, per FDA\u2019s discretion, EUAs for unapproved uses of approved products, include requirements for adverse event monitoring and reporting, and other recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Note, however, that approved products are already subject to equivalent requirements.\nIn addition, the FDA may include various requirements in an EUA as a matter of discretion as deemed necessary to protect the public health, including restrictions on which entities may distribute the product, and how to perform distribution (including requiring that distribution be limited to government entities), restrictions on who may administer the product, requirements for collection and analysis of safety and effectiveness data, waivers of cGMP, and restrictions applicable to prescription drugs or restricted devices (including advertising and promotion restrictions).\nThe FDA may revoke an EUA when it is determined that the underlying health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization, if the conditions for the issuance of the EUA are no longer met, or if other circumstances make revocation appropriate to protect the public health or safety. We cannot predict how long, if ever, an EUA would remain in place.\nWe cannot predict with certainty whether we will be able to collect data that can support an application for EUA for CAP-1002 or any other COVID-19 therapies or vaccines we may develop. Even if we do submit an application, we cannot predict whether FDA will grant an EUA for CAP-1002 or any other COVID-19 therapies or vaccines we may develop based on the study data. We also cannot predict how long, if ever, an EUA would remain in place.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to identify or discover additional potential product candidates.\nOur research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons, including:\n\u25cf the research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential product candidates;\n\u25cf potential product candidates may, on further study, be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be drugs that will receive marketing approval and/or achieve market acceptance; and\n\u25cf potential product candidates may not be safe or effective in treating their targeted diseases.\nResearch programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. If we are unable to identify suitable compounds for preclinical and clinical development, our business would be harmed.\nNegative perception of the efficacy, safety, or tolerability of any investigational medicines that we develop, or of other products similar to products we are developing, such as mRNA medicines or vaccines, could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business, advance our investigational medicines, or obtain regulatory approvals.\nA limited number of mRNA medicines have been granted EUA or have been approved to date by the FDA or any other regulatory agency. Adverse events in clinical trials of our investigational medicines or in clinical trials of others developing similar products, including other mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, and the resulting publicity, as well as any other adverse events in the field of mRNA medicine, or other products that are perceived to be similar to mRNA medicines, such as those related to gene therapy or gene editing, could result in a decrease in the perceived benefit of one or more of our programs, increased regulatory scrutiny, decreased confidence by patients and clinical trial collaborators in our investigational medicines, and less demand for any product that we may develop. If and when they are used in clinical trials, our developmental candidates and investigational medicines could result in a greater quantity of reportable adverse events, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, other reportable negative clinical outcomes, manufacturing reportable events or material clinical events that could lead to clinical delay or hold by the FDA or applicable regulatory authority or other clinical delays, any of which could negatively impact the perception of one or more of our programs, as well as our business as a whole. In addition, responses by U.S., state, or foreign governments to negative public perception may result in new legislation or regulations that could limit our ability to develop any investigational medicines or commercialize any approved products, obtain or maintain regulatory approval, or otherwise achieve profitability. More restrictive statutory regimes, government regulations, or negative public opinion would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects and may delay or impair the development of our investigational medicines and commercialization of any approved products or demand for any products we may develop.\nIf any of our product candidates receives marketing approval or an EUA and we, or others, later discover that the drug is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that were not previously identified, our ability, or that of any future collaborators, to market the drug could be compromised.\nClinical trials of our product candidates must be conducted in carefully defined subsets of patients who have agreed to enter into clinical trials. Consequently, it is possible that our clinical trials, or those of any future collaborator, may indicate an apparent positive effect of a product candidate that is greater than the actual positive effect, if any, or alternatively fail to identify undesirable side effects. If one or more of our product candidates receives marketing approval and we, or others, discover that the drug is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that were not previously identified, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the drug or seize the drug;\n\u25cf we, or any future collaborators, may be required to recall the drug, change the way the drug is administered or conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u25cf additional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of, or the manufacturing processes for, the particular drug;\n\u25cf we may be subject to fines, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \u201cblack box\u201d warning or a contraindication;\n\u25cf we, or any future collaborators, may be required to create a Medication Guide outlining the risks of the previously unidentified side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u25cf we, or any future collaborators, could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u25cf the drug may become less competitive in the marketplace; and\n\u25cf our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our operations and business and could adversely impact our stock price.\nEven if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, they may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nIf any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, they may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community. If our product candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant revenues from sales of drugs and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf the efficacy and safety of the product;\n\u25cf the potential advantages of the product compared to alternative therapies;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u25cf whether the product is designated under physician and other provider treatment guidelines as a first-, second- or third-line therapy;\n\u25cf our ability, or the ability of any future collaborators, to offer the product for sale at competitive prices;\n\u25cf the product\u2019s convenience and ease of administration for patients and healthcare practitioners compared to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf the willingness of the target patient population to try, and of physicians to prescribe, the product;\n\u25cf limitations or warnings, including distribution or use restrictions and safety information contained in the product\u2019s approved labeling;\n\u25cf the strength of sales, marketing and distribution support;\n\u25cf the performance of our exclusive distributor for our lead product candidate, CAP-1002;\n\u25cf changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for the product; and\n\u25cf the availability of coverage by, and the amount of reimbursement from, government payors, managed care plans and other third-party payors.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, evolving understanding of disease etiology and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. We face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to discover and develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Potential competitors also include academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.\nMany of the companies that we compete or may compete against in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Small or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and\nestablishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any drugs that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.\nThe FDA has granted orphan drug status and a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to CAP-1002 for the treatment of DMD, but we may be unable to maintain or receive the benefits associated with orphan drug status, including market exclusivity, or an RMAT designation.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition or for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for a disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. If a biological product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full Biologics License Application, or BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity.\nWe have received orphan drug status for CAP-1002 for the treatment of DMD. Even though we have received orphan drug designation (ODD) as described above, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for the orphan-designated indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products. For any product candidate for which we have been or will be granted ODD in a particular indication, it is possible that another company also holding ODD for the same product candidate will receive marketing approval for the same indication before we do. If that were to happen, our applications for that indication may not be approved until the competing company\u2019s period of exclusivity expires.\nIn addition, our exclusive marketing rights in the United States, if obtained, may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan designated indication and may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if we are unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Even though we have obtained orphan drug designation for CAP-1002 for a select indication, we may be unable to seek or obtain orphan drug designation for our future product candidates and we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for any particular orphan indication.\nWe have also obtained an RMAT designation for CAP-1002 for the treatment of DMD. The RMAT designation program is intended to fulfill the Cures Act requirement that the FDA facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of, any drug that meets the following criteria: (1) it qualifies as a RMAT, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions; (2) it is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (3) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. Like breakthrough therapy designation, RMAT designation provides potential benefits that include more frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate, and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. Products granted RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval on the basis of a surrogate or intermediate endpoint reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or may be able to rely upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites. RMAT designation does not change the standards for product approval, and there is no assurance that such designation will result in expedited review or approval or that the approved indication will not be narrower than the indication covered by the RMAT designation. Additionally, RMAT designation can be revoked if the criteria for eligibility cease to be met as clinical data emerges.\nEven if we were to obtain approval for CAP-1002 for the treatment of DMD with the rare pediatric disease designation, the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program may no longer be in effect at the time of such approval.\nCAP-1002 has received rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA for the treatment of DMD. The FDA generally define a \"rare pediatric disease\" as a serious or life-threatening disease that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. primarily under the age of 18 years old. Under the FDA's Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, upon the approval of a NDA or BLA for the treatment of a rare pediatric disease, the sponsor of such application would be eligible for a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher that can be used to obtain priority review for a subsequent NDA or BLA. The Priority Review Voucher may be sold or transferred an unlimited number of times, as long as the sponsor making the transfer has not yet submitted the application. Also, although Priority Review Vouchers may be sold or transferred to third parties, there is no guaranty that we will be able to realize any value if we were to sell a Priority Review Voucher. The FDA may also revoke any priority review voucher if the rare pediatric disease drug for which the voucher was awarded is not marketed in the U.S. within one year following the date of approval.\nCongress has only authorized the rare pediatric disease priority review voucher program until September 30, 2024. However, if a drug candidate receives RPD designation before September 30, 2024, it is eligible to receive a voucher if it is approved before September 30, 2026. This program has been subject to criticism, including by the FDA, and it is possible that even if we obtain approval for CAP-1002 and qualify for such a Priority Review Voucher, the program may no longer be in effect at the time of approval.\nProviding product for use in third party trials poses risks to our product candidates.\nIn addition to manufacturing CAP-1002 for its own clinical trials, Capricor provided CAP-1002 for investigational purposes in two clinical trials sponsored by CSMC. The first trial is known as \u201cRegression of Fibrosis and Reversal of Diastolic Dysfunction in HFpEF Patients Treated with Allogeneic CDCs.\u201d The second trial is known as \u201cPulmonary Arterial Hypertension treated with Cardiosphere-derived Allogeneic Stem Cells.\u201d In both studies, Capricor provided doses of CAP-1002 and received a negotiated amount of monetary compensation in exchange for doing so.\nProviding product for clinical trials sponsored by third parties poses significant risks for the Company as we will not have control over the conduct of the trial even though we have used our commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the investigative sites are contractually bound to follow the protocol and other procedures established by Capricor. Additionally, even though the investigative sites have experience in conducting clinical trials, any adverse event that may occur during the trial may have a negative impact on our efforts to obtain regulatory approval for our product. There are no assurances that the clinical trial sites will perform the studies in accordance with the protocol, the manuals provided by Capricor or the sponsor\u2019s instructions, or otherwise act in accordance with applicable law. There is no assurance that if research injuries are sustained, any insurance carrier will compensate Capricor for any liabilities or other losses sustained by Capricor arising out of these injuries. We have been informed by CSMC that both of these trials have ceased enrollment and that the trials have been concluded. Notwithstanding their cessation, there is a risk that injuries could result from the use of the product or other claims may arise.\nOur products face a risk of failure due to adverse immunological reactions.\nA potential risk of an allogeneic therapy such as that being tested by the Company with CAP-1002 is that patients might develop an immune response to the cells being infused. Such an immune response may induce adverse clinical effects which would impact the safety and efficacy of the Company\u2019s products and the success of our trials. Additionally, if research subjects have pre-existing antibodies or other immune sensitization to our cells, our cells and the therapy could potentially be rendered ineffective which could have a negative impact on the regulatory pathway for our product as well as the viability for other potential indications. After a patient in the HOPE-2 trial had a serious adverse event in the form of anaphylaxis, we put a voluntary hold on dosing in December 2018 to develop a plan to manage potential allergic reactions. The investigation suggests that the patient may have been allergic to something contained in the investigational product, including possibly an excipient, or inactive ingredient, in the formulation. To reduce the risk of future events, we initiated a pre-medication strategy commonly used by physicians to prevent and treat allergic reactions. We cannot provide any assurances that this will not happen again in any future studies. If these or other reactions continue to occur, it could have a material adverse impact on the effectiveness of the product, our ability to receive approval of our product candidates, and could result in substantial delays, increased costs and potentially termination of the trial.\nOur business faces significant government regulation, and there is no guarantee that our product candidates will receive regulatory approval.\nOur research and development activities, preclinical studies, clinical trials, and manufacturing and marketing of our potential products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States, as well as by regulatory authorities in other countries. In the United States, our product candidates are subject to regulation as biological products or as combination biological products/medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and other statutes, and as further provided in the Code of Federal Regulations. Different regulatory requirements may apply to our products depending on how they are categorized by the FDA under these laws. These regulations can be subject to substantial and significant interpretation, addition, amendment or revision by the FDA and by the legislative process. The FDA may determine that we will need to undertake clinical trials beyond those currently planned. Furthermore, the FDA may determine that results of clinical trials do not support approval for the product. Similar determinations may be encountered in foreign countries. The FDA will continue to monitor products in the market after approval, if any, and may determine to withdraw its approval or otherwise seriously affect the marketing efforts for any such product. The same possibilities exist for trials to be conducted outside of the United States that are subject to regulations established by local authorities and local law. Any such determinations would delay or deny the introduction of our product candidates to the market and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDrug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Agency, other federal agencies and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with good manufacturing practices, and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards, nor can we guarantee that we will maintain compliance with such regulations in regards to our own manufacturing processes. Other risks include:\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, specific warnings, a contraindication, or field alerts to physicians and pharmacies;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the IND or the product or require us to take our approved products off the market;\n\u25cf we may be required to change the way the product is manufactured or administered, and we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products;\n\u25cf we will be required to manufacture on our own behalf or retain the services of a commercial manufacturer to develop product suitable for commercial sale in compliance with cGMP requirements;\n\u25cf we may have limitations on how we or our distributor promote our products; and\n\u25cf we may be subject to litigation or product liability claims.\nThere are additional risks involved in conducting clinical trials internationally.\nIf we decide to expand one or more of our clinical trials to investigative sites in Europe, Asia, or other countries outside of the United States, we will have additional regulatory requirements that we will have to meet in connection with our manufacturing, distribution, use of data and other matters. For example, if we decide to conduct our trials in Europe, we may have to move our manufacturing facility to a facility located in Europe, enter into an agreement with a European manufacturer to manufacture our product candidates for us, enter into an agreement with a domestic manufacturer who maintains an acceptable cGMP facility or maintain a facility that meets European specifications. Any of those options would involve a significant monetary investment, time delays, and increased risk and may impact the progress of our clinical trials and regulatory approvals.\nTo the extent we conduct business in the European Union, or EU, or receive information about EU residents, we will also have to comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which was officially adopted in April 2016 and went into effect in May 2018. The GDPR introduces new data protection requirements in the EU, as well as substantial fines for breaches of data protections rules. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information, mandatory data breach notification requirements and onerous new obligations on services providers. Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of personal data, such as healthcare data or other sensitive information, could greatly increase\nour cost of providing our products and services or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions in which we operate.\nAdditionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations. As we expand our business outside of the United States, ensuring compliance with the FCPA and the laws of other countries will involve additional monetary and time commitments on behalf of the Company.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, we may still face future development and FDA regulatory difficulties.\nEven if U.S. regulatory approval is obtained, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies. If any of our products were granted accelerated approval, the FDA could require post-marketing confirmatory trials to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under the accelerated approval pathway if any of the following were to occur: a trial required to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product fails to verify such benefit; other evidence demonstrates that the product is not shown to be safe or effective under the conditions of use; the applicant fails to conduct any required post-approval trial of the drug with due diligence; or the applicant disseminates false or misleading promotional materials relating to the product. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval the pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.\nGiven the number of recent high-profile adverse safety events with certain drug products, the FDA may require, as a condition of approval, costly risk management programs, which may include safety surveillance, restricted distribution and use, patient education, enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre-approval of promotional materials, and restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising. Furthermore, heightened Congressional scrutiny on the adequacy of the FDA\u2019s drug approval process and the FDA\u2019s efforts to assure the safety of marketed drugs have resulted in the proposal of new legislation addressing drug safety issues. If enacted, any new legislation could result in delays or increased costs during the period of product development, clinical trials, and regulatory review and approval, as well as increased costs to assure compliance with any new post-approval regulatory requirements. Any of these restrictions or requirements could force us to conduct costly studies or increase the time for us to become profitable. For example, any labeling approved for any of our product candidates may include a restriction on the term of its use, or it may not include one or more of our intended indications.\nOur product candidates will also be subject to ongoing FDA requirements for the labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, record-keeping, and submission of safety and other post-market information on the drug. New issues may arise during a product lifecycle that did not exist, or were unknown, at the time of product approval, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured. Since approved products, manufacturers, and manufacturers\u2019 facilities are subject to continuous review and periodic inspections, these new issues post-approval may result in voluntary actions by Capricor or may result in a regulatory agency imposing restrictions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market or for use in a clinical trial. If our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, such as good manufacturing practices, a regulatory agency may:\n\u25cf issue warning or untitled letters;\n\u25cf require us to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions, and penalties for noncompliance;\n\u25cf impose other civil or criminal penalties;\n\u25cf suspend regulatory approval;\n\u25cf suspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u25cf refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us;\n\u25cf impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u25cf seize or detain products or require a product recall.\nIn order to market and commercialize any product candidate outside of the United States, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding manufacturing, safety and efficacy. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process in other countries may include all of the risks detailed above regarding FDA approval in the United States as well as other risks. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in other countries, or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval, could have the same adverse effects detailed above regarding FDA approval in the United States. Such effects include the risks that our product candidates may not be approved for all indications requested, which could limit the uses of our product candidates and have an adverse effect on product sales and potential royalties, and that such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or require costly, post-marketing follow-up studies.\nIf we or current or future collaborators, manufacturers, or service providers fail to comply with healthcare laws and regulations, we or they could be subject to enforcement actions and substantial penalties, which could affect our ability to develop, market and sell our products and may harm our reputation.\nAlthough we do not currently have any products on the market, if our therapeutic candidates or clinical trials become covered by federal health care programs, we will be subject to additional healthcare statutory and regulatory requirements and enforcement by the federal, state and foreign governments of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any therapeutic candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, transparency, and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our therapeutic candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual for a healthcare item or service, or the purchasing or ordering of an item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to clarify that a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. The Anti-Kickback Statute applies to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and individuals, such as healthcare providers and prescribers, patients, purchasers, pharmacy benefit managers, group purchasing organizations, third-party payors, wholesalers and distributors on the other hand, including, for example, consulting/speaking arrangements, discount and rebate offers, certain pricing arrangements, grants, charitable contributions, and patient support offerings, among others. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in significant civil monetary penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act. Violations can also result in criminal penalties, including criminal fines and imprisonment. Similarly, violations can result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u25cf the federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or knowingly making or causing to be made, a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from\na violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose significant civil fines and penalties for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes \u201cany request or demand\u201d for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the federal False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to \u201ccause\u201d the submission of false or fraudulent claims;\n\u25cf the Federal Criminal Statute on False Statements Relating to Health Care Matters makes it a crime to knowingly and willfully falsify, conceal, or cover up a material fact, make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations, or make or use any materially false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services;\n\u25cf the Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law authorizes the imposition of substantial civil monetary penalties against an entity, such as a pharmaceutical manufacturer, that engages in activities including, among others (1) knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a claim for services not provided as claimed or that is otherwise false or fraudulent in any way; (2) arranging for or contracting with an individual or entity that is excluded from participation in federal health care programs to provide items or services reimbursable by a federal health care program; (3) violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute; or (4) failing to report and return a known overpayment;\n\u25cf the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, includes a fraud and abuse provision referred to as the HIPAA All-Payor Fraud Law, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u25cf HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which impose obligations on certain covered entity healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding, the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information;\n\u25cf the FDCA, which prohibits the adulteration and misbranding of drugs, including therapeutic biological products;\n\u25cf federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;\n\u25cf the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the government information related to payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d made to, at the request of, or on behalf of \u201ccovered recipients,\u201d which include physicians, certain other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to the government ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and\n\u25cf analogous state laws and regulations, such as, state anti-kickback and false claims laws potentially applicable to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by nongovernmental third party payors, including private insurers; and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant\ncompliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nThe scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Responding to investigations can be time-and resource-consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business.\nEfforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations could involve substantial costs. If our operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, we may be subject to significant penalties, including the imposition of civil, criminal or administrative penalties, monetary fines, damages, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, or exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, any of which could adversely affect our financial results. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these or any other health regulatory laws that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely impact our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nAlthough effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for an alleged or suspected violation, even the mere issuance of a subpoena or the fact of an investigation alone, regardless of the merit, could result in negative publicity, a drop in our share price, or other harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations. Defending against any such actions could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and could divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business, even if our defense is successful. In addition, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be costly to us in terms of money, time and resources.\nAny drugs we develop may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third party coverage and reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, thereby harming our future business prospects.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drugs vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. Although we intend to monitor these regulations, our programs are currently in earlier stages of development and we will not be able to assess the impact of price regulations for a number of years. As a result, we might obtain regulatory approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country.\nOur ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. However, there may be significant delays in obtaining coverage for newly-approved drugs. Moreover, eligibility for coverage does not necessarily signify that a drug will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution costs. Also, interim payments for new drugs, if applicable, may be insufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Thus, even if we succeed in bringing one or more products to the market, these products may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective, and the amount reimbursed for any products may be insufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis. Because our programs are in early stages of development, we are unable at this time to determine\ntheir cost effectiveness or the likely level or method of reimbursement. In addition, obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our product on a payor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. A payor\u2019s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor\u2019s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate that we successfully develop.\nIncreasingly, the third-party payors who reimburse patients or healthcare providers, such as government and private insurance plans, are seeking greater upfront discounts, additional rebates and other concessions to reduce the prices for pharmaceutical products. If the price we are able to charge for any products we develop, or the reimbursement provided for such products, is inadequate in light of our development and other costs, our return on investment could be adversely affected.\nWe currently expect that certain drugs we develop may need to be administered under the supervision of a physician on an outpatient basis. Under currently applicable U.S. law, certain drugs that are not usually self-administered (including injectable drugs) may be eligible for coverage under Medicare through Medicare Part B. Specifically, Medicare Part B coverage may be available for eligible beneficiaries when the following, among other requirements have been satisfied:\n\u25cf the product is reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of the illness or injury for which the product is administered according to accepted standards of medical practice;\n\u25cf the product is typically furnished incident to a physician's services;\n\u25cf the indication for which the product will be used is included or approved for inclusion in certain Medicare-designated pharmaceutical compendia (when used for an off-label use); and\n\u25cf the product has been approved by the FDA.\nAverage prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the U.S. Reimbursement rates under Medicare Part B would depend in part on whether the newly approved product would be eligible for a unique billing code. Self-administered, outpatient drugs are typically reimbursed under Medicare Part D, and drugs that are administered in an inpatient hospital setting are typically reimbursed under Medicare Part A under a bundled payment. It is difficult for us to predict how Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies will be applied to our products in the future and coverage and reimbursement under different federal healthcare programs are not always consistent. Medicare reimbursement rates may also reflect budgetary constraints placed on the Medicare program.\nThird party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. These coverage policies and limitations may rely, in part, on compendia listings for approved therapeutics. Our inability to promptly obtain relevant compendia listings, coverage, and adequate reimbursement from both government-funded and private payors for new drugs that we develop and for which we obtain regulatory approval could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our financial condition.\nThere have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Among policy makers and payors in the United States there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access and the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. We expect that these and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other\nhealthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs, once marketing approval is obtained.\nA number of legislative and regulatory changes in the healthcare system in the U.S. and other major healthcare markets have been proposed, and such efforts have expanded substantially in recent years. These developments could, directly or indirectly, affect our ability to sell our products, if approved, at a favorable price. For example, in the U.S., in 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the ACA, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of health spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the healthcare industry and impose additional policy reforms.\nThe ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things: (1) introduced a new average manufacturer price definition for drugs and biologics that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected and not generally dispensed through retail community pharmacies; (2) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, or MDRP; (3) established a branded prescription drug fee that pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs must pay to the federal government; (4) expanded the list of covered entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program; (5) established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts (which through subsequent legislative amendments, was increased to 70% from 50% starting in 2019) off negotiated prices of applicable branded drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; (6) extended manufacturers\u2019 MDRP rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; (7) expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals, including individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liabilities; (8) created a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products; and (9) established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to test innovative payment and service delivery models to improve patient care and lower costs.\nThe framework of the ACA and other healthcare reforms continues to evolve as a result of executive, legislative, regulatory, and administrative developments; in addition, healthcare-related litigation and judicial proceedings contribute to regulatory uncertainty. While Congress has not passed legislation to comprehensively repeal the ACA, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, included a provision that, effective January 1, 2019, changed to $0 the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequent laws, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 enacted as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or the CARES Act, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. New laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which may materially adversely affect customer demand and affordability for our products and, accordingly, the results of our financial operations.\nIn addition, effective January 1, 2019, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, further amended portions of the Social Security Act implemented as part of the ACA to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that pharmaceutical manufacturers participating in the Coverage Gap Discount Program must provide to eligible Medicare Part D beneficiaries during the coverage gap phase of the Part D benefit, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole,\u201d and to reduce standard beneficiary cost sharing in the coverage gap from 30% to 25% in most Medicare Part D plans. In the future, there may be additional challenges and/or amendments to the ACA. It remains to be seen precisely what any new legislation will provide, when or if it will be enacted, and what impact it will have on the availability and cost of healthcare items and services, including drug products.\nIn addition, in recent years the pricing and costs of prescription pharmaceuticals has been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. A number of federal reports and inquiries have focused on these issues, and various legislative and regulatory provisions have been proposed and enacted at the federal and state level that seek to bring more transparency to product pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. On December 21, 2020, Congress passed a $900 billion U.S. coronavirus relief and government appropriations legislation, or the Act, which contains several important new drug price reporting and transparency measures that could result in additional transparency with respect to manufacturers\u2019 prescription drug prices. Among other things, the Act includes provisions requiring Medicare Part D prescription drug plan, or PDP, sponsors and Medicare Advantage organizations, or MAOs, to implement tools to display Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit information in real time and provisions requiring group and health insurance issuers offering health insurance coverage to report information on certain pharmacy benefit and drug costs to the Secretaries of HHS, Labor, and the Treasury. We believe that the efforts of governments and third-party payors to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare and legislative and regulatory proposals to broaden the availability of healthcare will continue to affect the business and financial condition of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies.\nFurther, the Biden Administration and Congress may pursue additional and potentially significant changes to the current healthcare laws, regulations, and related guidance. The Biden Administration issued a memorandum on January 20, 2021 (President Biden\u2019s inauguration day) that, like similar memoranda issued by prior incoming Administrations, directed federal agencies to take steps to halt, delay, or conduct further review of certain regulatory actions taken by the Trump Administration, such as those that had not taken effect by inauguration day. The Biden Administration\u2019s review is ongoing and we cannot predict which regulatory actions it may or may not affect. We also cannot predict what other healthcare reforms will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation and, accordingly, face uncertainties that might result from additional reforms.\nOur risk mitigation measures cannot guarantee that we effectively manage all operational risks and that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or other requirements.\nThe development, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, sale, marketing and reimbursement of our product candidates, together with our general operations, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation in the United States and may be subject to extensive regulation in foreign countries. In addition, our business is complex, involves significant operational risks and includes the use of third parties to conduct business. While we intend to implement numerous risk mitigation measures to comply with such regulations in this complex operating environment, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to effectively mitigate all operational risks. We cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our consultants, our contractors or other third parties are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and/or laws, and all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or laws. If we fail to adequately mitigate our operational risks or if we or our agents fail to comply with any of those regulations or laws, a range of actions could result, including, but not limited to, the termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product candidate, restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of our products from the market, significant fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs or other sanctions or litigation. Any of these occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur employees and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee or consultant fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by our employees or consultants could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply with manufacturing standards, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. Employee and consultant misconduct could involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter such misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and result in the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions against us.\nOur ability to obtain reimbursement or funding for our programs from the federal government may be impacted by possible reductions in federal spending.\nU.S. federal government agencies currently face potentially significant spending reductions. For example, as a result of the Budge Control Act of 2011, the Bipartisan Budget Act, or BBA, and the CARES Act, an annual 2% reduction to Medicare payments took effect on April 1, 2013, and has been extended through 2030 (though the reduction was temporarily suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 in connection with COVID-19 relief related legislation). The U.S. federal budget remains in flux, however, which could, among other things, result in a cut to Medicare payments to providers and otherwise affect federal spending on clinical and preclinical research and development. The Medicare program is frequently mentioned as a target for spending cuts. The full impact on our business of any future cuts in Medicare or other programs is uncertain. In addition, we cannot predict any impact which the actions of President Biden\u2019s administration and the U.S. Congress may have on the federal budget. Following the most recent federal elections, Congress has again focused on reducing the cost of drugs and other medical treatments. If federal spending is reduced, anticipated budgetary shortfalls may also impact the ability of relevant agencies, such as the FDA or the National Institutes of Health, to continue to function at current levels. Amounts allocated to federal grants and contracts may be reduced or eliminated. These reductions may also impact the ability of relevant agencies to timely review and approve drug research and development, manufacturing, and marketing activities, which may delay our ability to develop, market and sell any products we may develop.\nVaccines carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative impact on future results of operations.\nWe are planning to potentially develop vaccine candidates using our exosome technologies. The successful development, testing, manufacturing and commercialization of vaccines is a long, complex, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties associated with vaccines, including:\n\u25cf There may be limited access to, and supply of, normal and diseased tissue samples, cell lines, media pathogens, bacteria, viral strains, synthesized nucleic acids, including mRNA and other biological materials. In addition, government regulations in multiple jurisdictions, such as the United States and the EU, could result in restricted access to, or the transport or use of, such materials. If the Company in unable to access sufficient sources of such materials, or if tighter restrictions are imposed on the use of such materials, the Company may not be able to conduct research or product development activities as planned and may incur additional costs.\n\u25cf The development, manufacturing and marketing of vaccines are subject to regulation by the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory bodies that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. For example, in the United States, a BLA, including both preclinical and clinical trial data and extensive data regarding the manufacturing procedures, is required for human vaccine candidates, and FDA approval is generally required for the release of each manufactured commercial lot.\n\u25cf Vaccines are frequently costly to manufacture because production ingredients are inactive biological materials derived from virus, animals, or plants and most biologics and vaccines cannot be made synthetically. In particular, keeping up with the demand for vaccines may be difficult due to the complexity of producing vaccines.\nRisks Related to the Manufacturing of our Product Candidates\nWe have limited manufacturing capability and may not be able to maintain our manufacturing licenses.\nOur primary research facility is located in San Diego, California. We also maintain a portion of our laboratories, research and manufacturing facilities in leased premises at CSMC in Los Angeles, California. In that portion of the leased premises where we manufacture CAP-1002 and may manufacture our exosome technologies, we believe that we follow good manufacturing practices sufficient for an investigational stage product. Capricor manufactured CAP-1002 in this facility for our previous clinical studies as well as our HOPE-2 clinical trial.\nAs we initiate a Phase III study for DMD, we are unsure at this time if the FDA will allow us to produce doses in our current facility or whether the FDA will require us to use a cGMP facility. If we are required to use a cGMP facility to produce product for a Phase III study, it may result in delays and significant expenses which would have a negative impact on our business and product development. In addition, FDA may disagree with our position that the drug used in our prior clinical studies is sufficiently comparable to the drug to be used in the forthcoming Phase III study. This could\nresult in us being required to conduct further comparability testing and may result in us being required to conduct additional clinical trials before we are able to submit a BLA for approval. Additional testing or clinical trial requirements could lead us not to pursue an application for approval. Conducting a clinical trial may prove too difficult or too expensive, and the process of designing a clinical trial, enrolling enough patients, and completing treatment and data collection under the protocol could take a significant amount of time, effort, and resources. Even if we do complete the clinical trial, the study may not meet its prespecified endpoints, and even if it does, FDA may still disagree with our determination that the trial is sufficient to support submission and approval of a marketing application.\nIn 2020, we initiated a technology transfer with Lonza Houston, Inc., a leading global contract manufacturing organization to prepare for commercial or possibly late-stage clinical manufacturing of CAP-1002. Process development has been the focus of the work done by Lonza to date. We are evaluating whether it would be in our best interests to have Lonza move forward to complete the technology transfer process or whether we should manufacture our CAP-1002 product candidate in a cGMP facility leased by us.\nOur plans to use this facility for future trials could change if we decide to expand any of our clinical trials to include international sites, such as in Europe or if we fail to meet the specifications necessary to produce our product in a qualified manner. Currently, we also intend to utilize our premises at CSMC to develop and manufacture our exosomes technologies. Currently, our CSMC Facilities Lease is scheduled to expire on July 31, 2022. There can be no assurance that the Facilities Lease for the manufacturing space will be continued beyond July 31, 2022. If the Facilities Lease with CSMC is terminated or expires, we would have to secure alternative facilities in which to manufacture our products, which would involve a significant monetary investment and would negatively impact the progress of our clinical trials and regulatory approvals. At this time, we are actively considering new or expanded facilities for development and manufacturing activities and the possible extension of our current Facilities Lease.\nWe may be required to obtain and maintain certain licenses in connection with our manufacturing facilities and activities. There is no guarantee that any licenses issued to us will not expire, be revoked, forfeited by operation of law or otherwise. If we were denied any required license or if any of our licenses were to be revoked or forfeited, we would suffer significant harm. Additionally, if a serious adverse event in any of our clinical trials were to occur during the period in which any required license was not in place, we could be exposed to additional liability if it were determined that the event was due to our fault and we had not secured the required license. Other states may impose additional licensing requirements upon us which, until obtained, would limit our ability to conduct our trials in such states.\nWe obtain the donor hearts from which our CDCs are manufactured from organ procurement organizations, or OPOs. There is no guarantee that the OPOs which currently provide donor hearts to us will be able to continue to supply us with donor hearts in the future or, in that case, that an alternative OPO will be available to us. If those OPOs or an alternative OPO is not able or willing to supply us with donor hearts, we would be unable to produce our CDCs or exosomes and the development of our lead product candidates would be significantly impaired and possibly terminated. Additionally, OPOs are subject to regulations of various government agencies. There is no guarantee that laws and regulations pursuant to which our OPOs provide donor hearts will not change, making it more difficult or even impossible for the OPOs to continue to supply us with the hearts we need to produce our product.\nWe have no prior experience in manufacturing products for large, late-stage clinical trials or commercial use.\nTo date, our manufacturing experience has been limited to manufacturing CAP-1002 for clinical use in multiple clinical trials. Our experience in the manufacturing of exosomes is limited to producing product for preclinical use. We have no prior history or experience in manufacturing our allogeneic product for large scale, late-stage (Phase III) clinical trials or for commercial use. Our product candidates have not previously been tested in any large trials to show safety or efficacy, nor are they available for commercial use. We face risks of manufacturing failures and risks of making products that are not proven to be safe or effective.\nWe are subject to a number of manufacturing risks, any of which could substantially increase our costs and limit supply of our product candidates.\nThe process of manufacturing our product candidates is complex, highly regulated, and subject to several risks. For example, the process of manufacturing our product candidates is extremely susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure or improper installation or operation of equipment, or vendor or operator error. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes for any of our product candidates could result in reduced\nproduction yields, product defects, and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral, or other contaminations are discovered in our product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities in which our product candidates are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. In addition, the manufacturing facilities in which our product candidates are made could be adversely affected by supply chain issues, equipment failures, labor shortages, natural disasters, power failures and numerous other factors.\nIf we continue with the development of CAP-1002 or our exosome technologies, we may need to rely exclusively on third parties to formulate and manufacture these product candidates and provide us with the devices and other products necessary to administer such a product.\nAt this time, we have not established our own manufacturing facilities sufficient for the production of CAP-1002 or our exosome technologies for commercial purposes. Our resources and expertise to formulate or manufacture this product candidate on a large or commercial scale basis are limited. Additionally, if the field of RNA and other nucleic acid medicines continues to expand, we may encounter increasing competition for these supplies, materials and services. Demand for third-party manufacturing or testing facilities may grow at a faster rate than their existing capacity, which could disrupt our ability to find and retain third-party manufacturers capable of producing sufficient quantities of such raw materials, components, parts, and consumables required to manufacture our exosome-based RNA products. If CAP-1002 or any of our exosome technologies receives FDA approval, we may need to rely on one or more third-party contractors to manufacture supplies of these drug products which may cause delays in our ability to sell commercially. Our current and anticipated future reliance on a limited number of third-party manufacturers exposes us to the following risks:\n\u25cf We may be unable to identify manufacturers needed to manufacture our product candidates on acceptable terms or at all, because the number of potential manufacturers is limited, and subsequent to approval of an NDA or BLA, the FDA must approve any replacement contractor. This approval would require new testing and compliance inspections. In addition, a new manufacturer may have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our products or the devices after receipt of FDA approval, if any. FDA may also exercise oversight over manufacturing facilities for products authorized under an EUA.\n\u25cf Our third-party manufacturers may not be able to formulate and manufacture our drugs in the volume and of the quality required to meet our clinical and commercial needs, if any.\n\u25cf Our third-party manufacturers may not be able to manufacture or supply us with sufficient quantities of acceptable materials necessary for the development or use of our product candidates.\n\u25cf Our future contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store, and distribute our products or the materials needed to manufacture or utilize our product candidates.\n\u25cf Our contract manufacturers may elect to terminate our agreements with them.\n\u25cf Drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Agency, and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with good manufacturing practices and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards.\nEach of these risks could delay our clinical trials, the approval, if any, of our product candidates by the FDA, or the commercialization of our product candidates, or result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues.\nThe third parties we use in the manufacturing process for our product candidates may fail to comply with cGMP regulations.\nIf we decide to transfer the manufacturing of our product candidates for future clinical trials or for commercial supply, our contract manufacturers will be required to produce our drug products in compliance with cGMP. These contract manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign authorities to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign requirements. We do not have control over a third-party manufacturer\u2019s compliance with these regulations and requirements. In addition, changes in cGMP could negatively impact the ability of our contract manufacturers to complete the manufacturing process of our product candidates in a compliant manner on the schedule we require for clinical trials or for potential commercial use. The failure to achieve and maintain high quality compliance, including failure to detect or control anticipated or unanticipated manufacturing errors, could result in patient injury or death or product recalls. Any difficulties or delays in our contractors\u2019 manufacturing and supply of product candidates, or any failure of our contractors\nto maintain compliance with the applicable regulations and requirements could increase our costs, make us postpone or cancel clinical trials, prevent or delay regulatory approvals by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign authorities, prevent the import and/or export of our products, cause us to lose revenue, result in the termination of the development of a product candidate, or have our product candidates recalled or withdrawn from use.\nThe process of manufacturing our products is complex and we may encounter difficulties in production, particularly with respect to process development or scaling-up of our manufacturing capabilities.\nWe will be required to produce additional doses of CAP-1002 in order to conduct our Phase III clinical trial. The process of manufacturing our products is complex, highly regulated and subject to multiple risks. The complex processes associated with the manufacture of our product candidates expose us to various manufacturing challenges and risks, which may include delays in manufacturing adequate supply of our product candidates, limits on our ability to increase manufacturing capacity, and the potential for product failure and product variation that may interfere with preclinical and clinical trials, along with additional costs. We also may make changes to our manufacturing process at various points during development, and even after commercialization, for various reasons, such as controlling costs, achieving scale, decreasing processing time, increasing manufacturing success rate, or other reasons. Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve their intended objectives, and any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of current or future clinical trials, or the performance of the product, once commercialized. In some circumstances, changes in the manufacturing process may require us to perform ex vivo comparability studies and to collect additional data from patients prior to undertaking more advanced clinical trials. For instance, changes in our process during the course of clinical development may require us to show the comparability of the product used in earlier clinical trials or at earlier portions of a trial to the product used in later clinical trials or later portions of the trial. We may also make further changes to our manufacturing process before or after commercialization, and such changes may require us to show the comparability of the resulting product to the product used in the clinical trials using earlier processes. We may be required to collect additional clinical data from any modified process prior to obtaining marketing approval for the product candidate produced with such modified process. If clinical data are not ultimately comparable to that seen in the earlier trials in terms of safety or efficacy, we may be required to make further changes to our process and/or undertake additional clinical testing, either of which could significantly delay the clinical development or commercialization of the associated product candidate.\nAlthough we continue to build on our experience in manufacturing our products, we have no experience, as a company, manufacturing product candidates for commercial supply. We may never be successful in manufacturing product candidates in sufficient quantities or with sufficient quality for commercial use. Our manufacturing capabilities could be affected by cost-overruns, unexpected delays, equipment failures, labor shortages, operator error, natural disasters, unavailability of qualified personnel, difficulties with logistics and shipping, problems regarding yields or stability of product, contamination or other quality control issues, power failures, and numerous other factors that could prevent us from realizing the intended benefits of our manufacturing strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurthermore, compliance with cGMP requirements and other quality issues may arise during our internal efforts to scale-up manufacturing, and with our current or any future CMOs. If contaminants are discovered in our supply of our product candidates or in our manufacturing facilities or those of our CMOs, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. We cannot assure you that any stability failures or other issues relating to the manufacture of our product candidates will not occur in the future. Additionally, we and our CMOs may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes or unstable political environments. If we or our CMOs were to encounter any of these difficulties, our ability to provide our product candidate to patients in clinical trials, or to provide product for treatment of patients once approved, would be jeopardized.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may face uncertainty and difficulty in obtaining and enforcing our patents and other proprietary rights.\nOur success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain, maintain, and defend patents on our product candidates, obtain licenses to use third-party technologies, protect our trade secrets and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Legal standards regarding the scope of claims and validity of biotechnology patents are uncertain and evolving. There can be no assurance that our pending, in-licensed or Company-owned patent applications will be approved, or that challenges will not be instituted against the validity or enforceability of any patent licensed-in or\nowned by us. Additionally, we have entered into various confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties. There is no assurance that such agreements will be honored by such parties or enforced in whole or part by the courts. The cost of litigation to uphold the validity and prevent infringement of a patent is substantial. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent technologies not covered by patents to which we have rights or obtain access to our know-how. In addition, the laws of certain countries may not adequately protect our intellectual property. Our competitors may possess or obtain patents on products or processes that are necessary or useful to the development, use, or manufacture of our product candidates.\nThere can also be no assurance that our proposed technology will not infringe upon patents or proprietary rights owned by others, with the result that others may bring infringement claims against us and require us to license such proprietary rights, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any such litigation, if instituted, could have a material adverse effect, potentially including monetary penalties, diversion of management resources, and injunction against continued manufacture, use, or sale of certain products or processes.\nSome of our technology has resulted and/or will result from research funded by agencies of the U.S. government and the State of California. As a result of such funding, the U.S. government and the State of California have certain rights in the technology developed with the funding. These rights include a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable, paid-up, worldwide license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the government(s) such inventions. In addition, the government(s) has the right to \u201cmarch in\u201d and require us to grant third parties licenses to such technology, in certain circumstances, such as if we fail to take effective steps to achieve practical application of such inventions.\nThe licenses by which we have obtained some of our intellectual property are subject to the rights of the funding agencies. We also rely upon non-patented proprietary know-how and trade secrets. There can be no assurance that we can adequately protect our rights in such non-patented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques or gain access to our proprietary know-how and trade secrets. Any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, if any of our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information were to be disclosed, or misappropriated, the value of our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary rights would be significantly impaired and our business and competitive position would suffer.\nIn September 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. In particular, under the Leahy-Smith Act, the United States transitioned in March 2013 to a \u201cfirst to file\u201d system in which the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent. Third parties are allowed to submit prior art before the issuance of a patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and may become involved in derivation, post-grant review, or inter partes review, proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of our licensors. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our or our licensors\u2019 patent rights, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection. If we fail to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights adequately or secure rights to patents of others, the value of our intellectual property rights would diminish.\nOur commercial viability will depend, in part, on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of our product candidates, and the methods used to manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing our products is dependent upon the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities.\nWe have licensed certain patent and other intellectual property rights that cover cardiospheres (CSps), and cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs), (including our CAP-1002 product candidate) from Universit\u00e0 Degli Studi Di Roma La Sapienza, or the University of Rome, The Johns Hopkins University, or JHU, and CSMC. We have also licensed certain patent and other intellectual property rights from CSMC and JHU that cover extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes and microvesicles. Under the license agreements with the University of Rome and JHU, those institutions prosecute and maintain their patents and patent applications in collaboration with us. We rely on these institutions to file, prosecute, and maintain patent applications, and otherwise protect the intellectual property to which we have a license, and we have not\nhad and do not have primary control over these activities for certain of these patents or patent applications and other intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that such activities by these institutions have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights. Under our Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement with CSMC and our Exclusive License Agreement with CSMC, as the same have been amended, we have assumed, in coordination with CSMC, financial responsibility for the prosecution and maintenance of certain patents and patent applications thereunder. Our enforcement of certain of these licensed patents or defense of any claims asserting the invalidity and/or unenforceability of these patents would also be subject to the cooperation of the University of Rome, JHU, and/or CSMC.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent laws regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biopharmaceutical patents has emerged to date in the United States. The biopharmaceutical patent situation outside the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in the patents we own or that are in-licensed. Further, if any of our owned or in-licensed patents are determined by legal authority to be invalid or unenforceable, it could impact our ability to commercialize or license our technology.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u25cf others may be able to make products that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of any of our patents;\n\u25cf we might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by any issued patents or patent applications we may have (or third parties from whom we license intellectual property may have);\n\u25cf we might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u25cf it is possible that any pending patent applications we may have will not result in issued patents;\n\u25cf any issued patents may not provide us with any competitive advantage, or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges by third parties;\n\u25cf we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable or protectable under trade secrets law; and\n\u25cf the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe also may rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators, and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods, and know-how.\nIf any of our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information is improperly disclosed, the value of our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary rights would be significantly impaired and our business and competitive position would suffer.\nOur viability also depends upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, our consultants and advisors, as well as our licensors and contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how and our inventions for which patents may be unobtainable or difficult to obtain, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and contractors to enter into agreements which prohibit unauthorized disclosure and use of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. These agreements are often limited in duration and may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information. In addition, enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. If any of our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information is improperly disclosed, the value of our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary rights would be significantly impaired and our business and competitive position would suffer.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other adversarial proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights and we may be unable to protect our rights to, or use of, our technology.\nIf we choose to go to court to stop a third party from using the inventions covered by our patents, that individual or company has the right to ask the court to rule that such patents are invalid and/or should not be enforced against that third party. These lawsuits are expensive and would consume time and other resources, even if we were successful in discontinuing the infringement of our patents. In addition, there is a risk that the court will determine that these patents are not valid and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the inventions. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of these patents is upheld, the court will refuse to stop the other party on the ground that such other party\u2019s activities do not infringe our rights to these patents. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court has modified certain legal tests so as to make it harder to obtain patents from the USPTO, and to defend issued patents against invalidity challenges. As a consequence, issued patents may be found to contain invalid claims according to the revised legal standards. Some of our own or in-licensed patents may be subject to challenge and subsequent invalidation in a variety of post-grant proceedings, before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (the PTAB) of the USPTO or in litigation under the revised legal standards, which make it more difficult to defend the validity of claims in already issued patents.\nFurthermore, a third party may claim that we or our manufacturing or commercialization partners are using inventions covered by the third party\u2019s patent rights and may go to court to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, including making or selling our product candidates. These lawsuits are costly and could affect the results of our operations and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel. There is a risk that a court could determine that we or our commercialization partners are infringing the third party\u2019s patents and order us or our partners to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition, there is a risk that a court could order us or our partners to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party\u2019s patents. We have agreed to indemnify certain of our commercial partners against certain patent infringement claims brought by third parties. The biotechnology industry has produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products, manufacturing processes or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to claim construction by the courts, which is not always predictable or reasonable. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products, manufacturing processes or methods of use either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent and/or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity, in particular, is difficult since it requires a proof by clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents.\nAs some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing, and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our issued patents or our pending applications, or that we were the first to invent the technology. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology similar to ours. Any such patent applications may have priority over our patent applications or patents, which could further require us to obtain licenses to these issued patents covering such technologies. For patent applications filed before the Leahy-Smith Act, if another party has filed a United States patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful if, unbeknownst to us, the other party had independently arrived at the same or similar invention prior to our own invention, resulting in a loss of our U.S. patent position with respect to such inventions.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation or inter partes review proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations.\nSome jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted legislation which allows members of the public to access information under statutes similar to the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. Even though we believe our information would be excluded from the scope of such statutes, there are no assurances that we can protect our confidential information from being disclosed under the provisions of such laws. If any confidential or proprietary information is released to the public, such disclosures may negatively impact our ability to protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe have received confidential and proprietary information from third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise improperly used, misappropriated or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees.\nWe depend on intellectual property licensed from third parties and termination of any of these licenses could result in the loss of significant rights, which would harm our business.\nWe are dependent on patents, trade secrets, know-how and proprietary technology, both our own and that licensed from others. We have several license agreements, including with the University of Rome, JHU and CSMC. These licenses may be terminated upon certain conditions, including in some cases, if we fail to meet certain minimum funding or spending requirements, fail to take certain developmental actions, fail to pay certain minimum royalties, or fail to maintain the licensed intellectual property. Any termination of these licenses could result in the loss of significant rights and could harm our ability to commercialize our product candidates. Disputes may also arise between us and our licensors regarding intellectual property subject to a license agreement, including: the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other contract interpretation-related issues; whether and the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement; our right to sublicense patent and other rights to third parties under collaborative development relationships; our diligence obligations with respect to the use of the licensed technology in relation to our development and commercialization of our product candidates, and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations; and the ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners.\nIf disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates. If we or our licensors fail to adequately protect this intellectual property, our ability to commercialize products could suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Relationships with Third Parties\nWe will depend on our exclusive distributor, Nippon Shinyaku, for the commercial sale of our lead product CAP-1002 in DMD in the United States if we receive regulatory approval.\nWe believe that a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future will depend on milestones and other payments received from our distributor, Nippon Shinyaku. Nippon Shinyaku has exclusive distribution rights for CAP-1002 in the United States for a significant period of time, with only limited rights of either party to terminate the NS Distribution Agreement.\nWe are largely dependent on our relationships with our licensors and collaborators and there is no guarantee that such relationships will be maintained or continued.\nWe have entered into certain license agreements for certain intellectual property rights which are essential to enable us to develop and commercialize our products. Agreements have been entered into with the University of Rome, JHU and CSMC. Each of those agreements provides for an exclusive license to certain patents and other intellectual property and requires the payment of fees, milestone payments and/or royalties to the institutions that will reduce our net revenues, if and to the extent that we have future revenues. Each of those agreements also contains additional obligations that we are required to satisfy. There is no guarantee that we will be able to satisfy all of our obligations under our license agreements to each of the institutions and that such license agreements will not be terminated. Each of the institutions receives funding from independent sources such as the NIH and other private or not-for-profit sources and are investigating scientific and clinical questions of interest to their own principal investigators as well as the scientific and clinical communities at large. These investigators (including Capricor, Inc.\u2019s founder, Dr. Eduardo Marb\u00e1n, who is the Director of the Smidt Heart Institute at CSMC) and Dr. Stephen Gould (Johns Hopkins University) are under no obligation to conduct, continue, or conclude either current or future studies utilizing our cell therapy or exosomes technology, and they\nare not compelled to license any further technologies or intellectual property rights to us except as may be stated in the applicable licensing agreements or research agreements between those institutions and us. Changes in these collaborators\u2019 research interests or their funding sources away from our technology would have a material adverse effect on us. Further, the failure of any third-party licensor to comply with its licensing obligations under its respective agreement with us would have a material adverse effect on us. We are substantially dependent on our relationships with these institutions from which we license the rights to our technologies and know-how. If requirements under our license agreements are not met, including meeting defined milestones, we could suffer significant harm, including losing rights to our product candidates.\nIn addition, we are responsible for the cost of filing and prosecuting certain patent applications and maintaining certain issued patents licensed to us. If we do not meet our obligations under our license agreements in a timely manner, we could lose the rights to the proprietary technology.\nFinally, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of third parties (including and other than the University of Rome, JHU and CSMC) in connection with the development and use of our product candidates and technologies. Licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights might not be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nWe have received government grants and a loan award which impose certain conditions on our operations.\nCommencing in 2009, we received several grants from the NIH and DoD to fund various projects. Some of these awards remain subject to annual and quarterly reporting requirements and require us to allocate expenses to the applicable project.\nIn September 2016, Capricor was approved for a grant award from the DoD in the amount of approximately $2.4 million to be used toward developing a scalable, commercially-ready process to manufacture our exosomes. Under the terms of the award, disbursements were made to Capricor, subject to annual and quarterly reporting requirements. The Company utilized approximately $2.3 million under the terms of the award. We completed all close-out documentation associated with this award.\nOn February 5, 2013, we entered into the CIRM Loan Agreement, pursuant to which CIRM agreed to disburse approximately $19.8 million to us over a period of approximately three and one-half years to support Phase II of our ALLSTAR clinical trial. Under the CIRM Loan Agreement, we were required to repay the CIRM loan with interest at maturity. So long as we were not in default, the Loan Agreement had provisions allowing for forgiveness of the debt after the end of the project period, if we elected to abandon the project under certain circumstances. On November 17, 2017, we gave notice to CIRM that we were electing to abandon the CIRM-funded project pursuant to the Loan Agreement and on December 11, 2017, Capricor and CIRM entered into Amendment No. 3 to the CIRM Notice of Loan Award whereby the total loan balance under the CIRM Loan Agreement was forgiven by CIRM thereby terminating Capricor\u2019s and the Company\u2019s obligation to repay the loan balance. The Company classified the forgiveness of the loan payable, consisting of principal and accrued interest, of approximately $15.7 million as \u201cother income\u201d in our Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The decision to terminate the Loan Award and forgive the loan balance was due to the abandonment of the ALLSTAR project at the end of the project period in accordance with Section 4.10 of the Loan Agreement and Article VII, Section I of the CIRM Loan Administration Policy. Additionally, on June 16, 2016, Capricor entered into the CIRM Award with CIRM in the amount of approximately $3.4 million to fund, in part, the HOPE-Duchenne trial. Pursuant to terms of the CIRM Award, disbursements were tied to the achievement of specified operational milestones. The CIRM Award is further subject to the conditions and requirements set forth in the CIRM Grants Administration Policy for Clinical Stage Projects. Such requirements include, without limitation, the filing of quarterly and annual reports with CIRM, the sharing of intellectual property pursuant to Title 17, California Code of Regulations (CCR) Sections 100600-100612, and the sharing with the State of California of a fraction of licensing revenue received from a CIRM funded research project and net commercial revenue from a commercialized product which resulted from the CIRM funded research as set forth in Title 17, CCR Section 100608. The maximum royalty on net commercial revenue that Capricor may be required to pay to CIRM is equal to nine times the total amount awarded and paid to Capricor.\nIf we enter into strategic partnerships, we may be required to relinquish important rights to and control over the development of our product candidates or otherwise be subject to terms unfavorable to us.\nWe are actively looking into potential additional strategic partnerships for our product candidates, particularly for CAP-1002 in territories outside the United States and our exosomes product candidates. If we do not establish strategic\npartnerships, we potentially will have to undertake development and commercialization efforts with respect to our product candidates on our own, which would be costly and adversely impact our ability to commercialize any future products or product candidates. If we enter into any strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical, biotechnology or other life science companies, we will be subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our strategic partners devote to the development or commercialization of product candidates;\n\u25cf strategic partners may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding, terminate a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new version of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u25cf strategic partners may not pursue further development and commercialization of products resulting from the strategic partnering arrangement or may elect to discontinue research and development programs;\n\u25cf strategic partners may not commit adequate resources to the marketing and distribution of any future products, limiting our potential revenues from these products;\n\u25cf disputes may arise between us and our strategic partners that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management\u2019s attention and consumes resources;\n\u25cf strategic partners may experience financial difficulties;\n\u25cf strategic partners may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in a manner that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u25cf business combinations or significant changes in a strategic partner\u2019s business strategy may also adversely affect a strategic partner\u2019s willingness or ability to complete its obligations under any arrangement; and\n\u25cf strategic partners could independently move forward with a competing product candidate developed either independently or in collaboration with others, including our competitors.\nWe rely and will rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe depend and will depend upon independent investigators and collaborators, such as universities, medical institutions, CROs, vendors and strategic partners to conduct our preclinical and clinical trials under agreements with us. We negotiate budgets and contracts with CROs, vendors and trial sites which may result in delays to our development timelines and increased costs. We rely heavily on these third parties over the course of our clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and these third parties are required to comply with current good clinical practices, or cGCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable cGCP regulations, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure that, upon inspection, such regulatory authorities will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with the cGCP regulations. Biologic products for commercial purposes must also be produced under cGMP. Our failure or any failure by these third parties to comply with these regulations or to recruit a sufficient number of patients may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of these third parties violates federal or state fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations or healthcare privacy and security laws and regulations.\nAny third parties conducting our clinical trials are not and will not be our employees and, except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, which in some instances may be limited, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing preclinical, clinical and nonclinical programs. These third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies or other drug development activities, which could affect their performance on our behalf. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended,\ndelayed or terminated and we may not be able to complete development of, obtain regulatory approval of or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed. Switching or adding third parties to conduct our clinical trials involves substantial cost and requires extensive management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new third party commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines.\nRisks Related to Competitive Factors\nOur products will likely face intense competition.\nThe Company is engaged in fields that are characterized by extensive worldwide research and competition by pharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, specialized biotechnology companies, hospitals, physicians and academic institutions, both in the United States and abroad. We will experience intense competition with respect to our existing and future product candidates. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, with a number of established, large pharmaceutical companies, as well as many smaller companies. Many of these organizations competing with us have substantially greater financial resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities, greater clinical trial experience, longer drug development history in obtaining regulatory approvals, and greater manufacturing, distribution, sales and marketing capabilities than we do. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, government agencies, and research organizations actively engaged in research and development of products which may target the same indications as our product candidates. We expect any future products and product candidates that we develop to compete on the basis of, among other things, product efficacy and safety, time to market, price, extent of adverse side effects, and convenience of treatment procedures. One or more of our competitors may develop products based upon the principles underlying our proprietary technologies earlier than we do, obtain approvals for such products from the FDA more rapidly than we do, or develop alternative products or therapies that are safer, more effective and/or more cost effective than any product developed by us. Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we are able to or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, useful, and less costly than ours, and may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products.\nOur future success will depend in part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to evolving therapies as well as other novel technologies. Existing or future therapies developed by others may render our potential products obsolete or noncompetitive. The drugs that we are attempting to develop will have to compete with existing therapies. In addition, companies pursuing different but related fields represent substantial competition. These organizations also compete with us to attract qualified personnel and parties for acquisitions, joint ventures, or other collaborations.\nIf we are unable to retain and recruit qualified scientists and advisors, or if any of our key executives, key employees or key consultants discontinues his or her employment or consulting relationship with us, it may delay our development efforts or otherwise harm our business. In addition, several of our consultants render services on a part-time basis to other entities which may result in the creation of intellectual property rights in favor of those entities.\nBecause of the specialized nature of our technology, we are dependent upon existing key personnel and on our ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers and scientific personnel for research, clinical studies, and development activities conducted or sponsored by us. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in our fields of research and development, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract additional qualified personnel necessary for the development and commercialization of our product candidates or retain our current personnel.\nWe have experienced employee turnover from time to time, including involving some of our key employees. The loss of any of our current key employees or key consultants could impede the achievement of our research and development objectives. Furthermore, recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development work in the future is critical to the Company\u2019s success, both to enable the Company to grow, and to allow the Company to replace any employees or consultants whose relationships with the Company have been terminated. The market for employees with experience in the cell therapy and exosome industries is especially competitive, and we may not be able to recruit employees needed to develop and manufacture our products or be able to retain the employees whom we do recruit.\nThere has been a close working relationship between the academic lab at CSMC and our research and development team where employees and consultants of both entities contribute time and services to the research being performed by the other. As a result, it can sometimes be unclear whether intellectual property developed out of these services for CSMC would be owned by CSMC or by the Company, although if owned by CSMC, the Company may have rights to that intellectual property under the terms of its license agreements with CSMC.\nWe have also developed a close working relationship between the academic lab of Dr. Stephen Gould at Johns Hopkins University and our research and development team where employees and consultants of both entities contribute time and services to the research being performed by the other. As a result, it can sometimes be unclear whether intellectual property developed out of these services would be owned by JHU or by the Company, although if owned by JHU, the Company may have rights to that intellectual property under the terms of its license and research agreements with JHU. Unless extended, the SRA with JHU is scheduled to expire on March 31, 2022.\nThe Company may be unable to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among biotechnology, biopharmaceutical, and health care companies, universities, and non-profit research institutions for experienced scientists. Certain of the Company\u2019s officers, directors, scientific advisors, and/or consultants or certain of the officers, directors, scientific advisors, and/or consultants hereafter appointed may from time to time serve as officers, directors, scientific advisors, and/or consultants of other biopharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. The Company currently does not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on any of its officers or employees. All of the Company\u2019s employees will be employed \u201cat will\u201d and, therefore, each employee may leave the employment of the Company at any time. If we are unable to retain our existing employees, including qualified scientific personnel, and attract additional qualified candidates, the Company\u2019s business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not establish strategic partnerships, we will have to undertake development and commercialization efforts on our own, which would be costly and delay our ability to commercialize any future products or product candidates.\nAn element of our business strategy includes potentially partnering with pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other companies to obtain assistance for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates, including the cash and other resources we need for such development and potential commercialization. We may not be able to negotiate strategic partnerships on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to negotiate strategic partnerships for our product candidates, we may be forced to curtail the development of a particular candidate, reduce, delay, or terminate its development program, delay its potential commercialization, reduce the scope of our sales or marketing activities or undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. In addition, we will bear all risk related to the development of that product candidate. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we will need to obtain substantial additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do not secure sufficient funds, we will not be able to complete our trials or bring our product candidates to market and generate product revenue. In January 2022, we entered into the NS Distribution Agreement with Nippon Shinyaku for the exclusive commercialization and distribution rights in the United States of CAP-1002 for DMD. We continue to evaluate potential partners for this program in other territories, subject to any rights of Nippon Shinyaku under the NS Distribution Agreement.\nWe have no experience selling, marketing, or distributing products and no current internal capability to do so.\nThe Company currently has no sales, marketing, or distribution capabilities. We do not anticipate having resources in the foreseeable future to allocate to the sales and marketing of our proposed products. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to enter into and maintain sales and marketing collaborative relationships, or on our ability to build sales and marketing capabilities internally. As we entered into the NS Distribution Agreement with Nippon Shinyaku, we will depend upon Nippon Shinyaku\u2019s strategic interest in our CAP-1002 product candidate, and Nippon Shinyaku\u2019s ability to successfully market and sell any such products, if and when approved. If any of our other product candidates are cleared for commercialization, we intend to pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of such products, however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements, or if able to do so, that such collaborators will have effective sales forces. To the extent that we decide not to, or are unable to, enter into collaborative arrangements with respect to the sales and marketing of our proposed products, significant capital expenditures, management resources, and time will be required to establish and develop an in-house marketing and sales force with sufficient technical expertise. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain relationships with third-party collaborators or develop in-house sales and distribution capabilities. To the extent that we depend on third parties for marketing and distribution, such as our partnership with\nNippon Shinyaku, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, and there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful.\nIf any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval do not achieve broad market acceptance, the revenues that we generate from their sales, if any, will be limited.\nThe commercial viability of our product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities will depend upon their acceptance among physicians, the medical community, and patients, and coverage and reimbursement of them by third-party payors, including government payors. The degree of market acceptance of any of our approved products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf limitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s FDA-approved labeling;\n\u25cf changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for any of our product candidates, which could reduce the marketing impact of any claims that we could make following FDA approval;\n\u25cf limitations inherent in the approved indication for any of our product candidates compared to more commonly understood or addressed conditions;\n\u25cf lower demonstrated clinical safety and efficacy compared to other products;\n\u25cf prevalence and severity of adverse effects;\n\u25cf ineffective marketing and distribution efforts;\n\u25cf lack of availability of reimbursement from managed care plans and other third-party payors;\n\u25cf lack of cost-effectiveness;\n\u25cf timing of market introduction and perceived effectiveness of competitive products;\n\u25cf availability of alternative therapies at similar costs; and\n\u25cf potential product liability claims.\nOur ability to effectively promote and sell our product candidates in the marketplace will also depend on pricing, including our ability to manufacture a product at a competitive price. We will also need to demonstrate acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy and may need to demonstrate relative convenience and ease of administration. Market acceptance could be further limited depending on the prevalence and severity of any expected or unexpected adverse side effects associated with our product candidates. If our product candidates are approved but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors, and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products, and we may not become or remain profitable. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful. If our approved drugs fail to achieve market acceptance, we will not be able to generate significant revenue, if any.\nOur development of a potential vaccine for COVID-19 or other indications is at an early stage and is subject to significant risks.\nOur development of a vaccine is in early stages, and we may be unable to produce a vaccine that successfully treats a particular virus in a timely manner, if at all. Even if we were able to successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for a vaccine, if the outbreak is effectively contained or the risk of coronavirus infection is diminished or eliminated before we can successfully develop and manufacture our vaccine, we may not be able to generate product revenues from the vaccine. Additionally, a number of pharmaceutical companies have already obtained regulatory approval for COVID-19 vaccines, and other companies with significantly more resources than us are developing COVID-19 vaccines. Even if we were able to successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for a COVID-19 vaccine, vaccines produced by these other companies may be superior to our vaccine. Even if a vaccine that we develop is not inferior to other available vaccines, it could be difficult to obtain market acceptance. We are committing financial resources and personnel to the development of a COVID-19 vaccine which may cause delays in or otherwise negatively impact our other development programs, despite uncertainties surrounding the longevity and extent of coronavirus as a global health concern. Our business could be negatively impacted by our allocation of significant resources to a global health threat that is unpredictable and could rapidly dissipate or against which our vaccine, if developed, may not be partially or fully effective, or for which better vaccine options may be available.\nEven if our product candidates are approved, our ability to generate product revenues will be diminished if our drugs sell for inadequate prices or patients are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement.\nOur or our collaborators\u2019 ability to generate significant sales of our products, if approved, depends on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Healthcare providers that purchase medicine or medical products for treatment of their patients generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the products. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance. Patients are unlikely to use our products if they do not receive reimbursement adequate to cover the cost of our products. Orphan drugs in particular have received recent negative publicity for the perceived high prices charged for them by their manufacturers, and as a result, other orphan drug developers such as us may be negatively impacted by such publicity and any U.S. or other government regulatory response.\nIn the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Many third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes to decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. If any of our product candidates fail to demonstrate attractive efficacy profiles, they may not qualify for coverage and reimbursement. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any product candidates that we develop through approval will be made on a plan-by-plan basis. One payor\u2019s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for the product. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will likely be a time-consuming process. Each plan determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a drug, what amount it will pay for the drug, the applicable formulary tier, and whether to require step therapy or other utilization management controls. Such decisions can strongly influence the adoption of a drug by patients and physicians. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and treating healthcare providers generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients may be unlikely to use and prescribers unlikely to prescribe our products unless adequate coverage is provided and reimbursement is available.\nAdditionally, a third-party payor\u2019s decision to provide coverage for a drug does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors, such as government or private healthcare insurers, carefully review and increasingly question the coverage of, and challenge the prices charged for, drug products. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that pharmaceutical companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for products. We may also be required to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to justify the coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Inadequate coverage or reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain marketing approval. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidates that we develop.\nFurther, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system that could affect our ability to sell any future drugs profitably. The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution by generic products. We anticipate additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future. These may include price controls and cost-containment measures, or more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and potentially could reduce demand for our products once approved, create additional pricing pressures, or ultimately limit our net revenue and results. There can be no assurance that any of our product candidates, if approved, will be considered medically reasonable and necessary, that they will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that coverage or an adequate level of reimbursement will be\navailable, or that reimbursement policies and practices in the United States and in foreign countries where our products are sold will not harm our ability to sell our product candidates profitably, if they are approved for sale.\nRisks Related to Product and Environmental Liability\nOur products may expose us to potential product liability, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain and maintain adequate insurance to cover these liabilities.\nThe testing, marketing, and sale of human cell therapeutics, pharmaceuticals, and services entail an inherent risk of adverse effects or medical complications to patients and, as a result, product liability claims may be asserted against us. A future product liability claim or product recall could have a material adverse effect on the Company. There can be no assurance that product liability insurance will be available to us in the future on acceptable terms, if at all, or that coverage will be adequate to protect us against product liability claims. In the event of a successful claim against the Company, insufficient or lack of insurance or indemnification rights could result in liability to us, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its future viability. The use of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval, if at all, expose the Company to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against the Company by consumers, health care providers or others using, administering or selling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against these claims, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u25cf costs of related litigation;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u25cf decreased demand for our product candidates;\n\u25cf impairment of our business reputation;\n\u25cf loss of revenues; and\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize our product candidates.\nThe Company has obtained clinical trial insurance coverage for its clinical trials. However, such insurance coverage may not reimburse the Company or the levels of coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse it for expenses or losses it may suffer or for its indemnification obligations. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect the Company against losses due to liability. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against the Company could have a material adverse effect on us and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could significantly decrease our cash position and adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, our clinical trial agreements and most agreements with third-party vendors contain indemnification obligations requiring us to indemnify them from any losses and claims that may be brought in connection with their provision of services, testing, manufacture or other activities in connection with the use of our products.\nOur business involves risk associated with handling hazardous and other dangerous materials.\nOur research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, human blood and tissue, animal blood and blood products, animal tissue, biological waste, and various radioactive compounds. The risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. The failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines against the Company, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes, or cessation of operations.\nOur business depends on compliance with ever-changing environmental and human health and safety laws.\nWe cannot accurately predict the outcome or timing of future expenditures that may be required to comply with comprehensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as laws and regulations designed to protect employees and others who handle hazardous materials. We must comply with environmental laws that govern, among other things, all emissions, waste water discharge and solid and hazardous waste disposal, and the remediation of contamination associated with generation, handling and disposal activities. To date, the Company has not incurred significant costs and is not aware of any significant liabilities associated with its compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. However, both federal and state environmental laws have changed in recent years and the Company may become subject to stricter environmental standards in the future and may face large capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws. We have limited capital and we are uncertain whether we will be able to pay for significantly large capital expenditures that may be required to comply with new laws. Also, future developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe expect that our stock price will continue to fluctuate significantly.\nThe stock market, particularly in recent years, has experienced significant volatility, particularly with respect to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences company stocks. Our operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons, and as a result our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations. Factors that could cause volatility in the market price of our common stock include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf our financial condition, including our need for additional capital, as well as the impact of any terms imposed on our business and operations by the providers of additional capital;\n\u25cf results from, delays in, or discontinuation of, any of the clinical trials for our drug candidates, including delays resulting from slower than expected or suspended patient enrollment or discontinuations resulting from a failure to meet pre-defined clinical endpoints;\n\u25cf announcements concerning clinical trials and regulatory developments;\n\u25cf failure or delays in entering drug candidates into clinical trials;\n\u25cf failure or discontinuation of any of our research or development programs;\n\u25cf developments in establishing and maintaining new strategic alliances or with existing alliances or collaborators;\n\u25cf failure to meet milestone requirements under distribution agreements, including the NS Distribution agreement with Nippon Shinyaku;\n\u25cf failure to satisfy licensing obligations, including our ability to meet milestone requirements under our license agreements;\n\u25cf market conditions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other healthcare related sectors;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf introduction of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf issues in manufacturing our drug candidates or drugs;\n\u25cf issues with the supply or manufacturing of any devices or materials needed to manufacture or utilize our drug candidates;\n\u25cf FDA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory actions affecting us or our industry;\n\u25cf the risks and costs of increased operations, including clinical and manufacturing operations, on an international basis;\n\u25cf market acceptance of our drugs, when they enter the market;\n\u25cf third-party healthcare coverage and reimbursement policies;\n\u25cf litigation or public concern about the safety of our drug candidates or drugs or the operations of the Company;\n\u25cf issuance of new or revised securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf potential delisting of our stock from the Nasdaq Stock Market; or\n\u25cf volatility in the stock prices of other companies in our industry.\nWe have never paid dividends and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the future.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying any dividends for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that the Company will retain its earnings, if any, for future growth. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in the Company\u2019s common stock for that purpose.\nWe may issue shares of blank check preferred stock without stockholder approval in the future.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, none of which are currently issued or currently outstanding. If issued, our Board of Directors will have the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred shares, as well as the authority to issue such shares, without further stockholder approval. As a result, our Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that is senior to our common stock that would grant to holders preferred rights to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividends, additional registration rights, anti-dilution protection, and the right to the redemption of such shares, together with other rights, none of which will be afforded holders of our common stock.\nMarket and economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and ability to obtain financing.\nRecent global market and economic conditions have been unpredictable and challenging. These conditions and any adverse impact on the financial markets may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our ability to access the capital markets to meet our liquidity needs.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. If no or few analysts maintain coverage of us, the trading price of our stock could decrease. If one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could also decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover our stock altogether, we could lose visibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe operational and other projections and forecasts that we may make from time to time are subject to inherent risks, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe projections and forecasts that our management may provide from time to time (including, but not limited to, those relating to timing, progress and anticipated results of clinical development, regulatory processes, clinical trial timelines and any anticipated benefits of our product candidates) reflect numerous assumptions made by management, including assumptions with respect to our specific as well as general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, there is a risk that the assumptions made in preparing the projections, or the projections themselves, will prove inaccurate. There will be differences between actual and projected results, and actual results may be materially different from those contained in the projections. The inclusion of the projections in (or incorporated by reference in) this prospectus should not be regarded as an indication that we or our management or representatives considered or consider the projections to be a reliable prediction of future events, and the projections should not be relied upon as such. Additionally, final data may differ significantly from preliminary reported data.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management team that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of preserving our current management, such as:\n\u25cf authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders;\n\u25cf eliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u25cf establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions could make it more difficult for our stockholders to affect our corporate policies or make changes in our Board of Directors and for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders.\nA significant number of shares of our common stock are issuable pursuant to outstanding stock awards and warrants, and we expect to issue additional stock awards and shares of common stock in the future. Exercise of these awards and warrants, and sales of shares will dilute the interests of existing security holders and may depress the price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 24.2 million shares of common stock outstanding and approximately 0.1 million common warrants outstanding, as well as outstanding awards to purchase approximately 3.8 million shares of common stock under various incentive stock plans of the Company. Additionally, as of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 3.9 million shares of common stock available for future issuance under various incentive plans. We may issue additional common stock, warrants and other convertible securities from time to time to finance our operations. We may also issue additional shares to fund potential acquisitions or in connection with additional stock options or other equity awards granted to our employees, officers, directors and consultants under our various incentive plans. The issuance of additional shares of common stock, warrants or other convertible securities and the perception that such issuances may occur or exercise of outstanding warrants or options may have a dilutive impact on other stockholders and could have a material negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to utilize Nile\u2019s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the future is subject to substantial limitations and may further be limited as a result of the merger with Capricor.\nFederal and state income tax laws impose restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss, or NOL, and tax credit carryforwards in the event that an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs for tax purposes, as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. In general, an ownership change occurs when stockholders owning 5% or more of a \u201closs corporation\u201d (a corporation entitled to use NOL or other loss carryforwards) have increased their aggregate ownership of stock in such corporation by more than 50 percentage points during any three-year period. If an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs, Section 382 of the Code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post-ownership change taxable income that may be offset with pre-ownership change NOLs of the loss corporation experiencing the ownership change. The annual limitation is calculated by multiplying the loss corporation\u2019s value immediately before the ownership change by the greater of the long-term tax-exempt rate determined by the IRS in the month of the ownership change or the two preceding months. This annual limitation may be adjusted to reflect any unused annual limitation for prior years and certain recognized built-in gains and losses for the year. Section 383 of the Code also imposes a limitation on the amount of tax liability in any post-ownership change year that can be reduced by the loss corporation\u2019s pre-ownership change tax credit carryforwards.\nThe merger between Nile Therapeutics, Inc., or Nile, and Capricor resulted in an \u201cownership change\u201d of Nile. In addition, previous or current changes in the Company\u2019s stock ownership may have triggered or, in the future, may trigger an \u201cownership change,\u201d some of which may be outside our control. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s ability to utilize Nile\u2019s NOL and tax credit carryforwards may be substantially limited. These limitations could, in turn, result in increased future tax payments for the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, or results of operations of the Company.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert management\u2019s attention.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and other applicable securities rules and regulations, and are subject to the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, or Nasdaq. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight is required. In addition, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and operating results. Although we have hired employees in order to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or Sarbanes-Oxley, as well as rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Nasdaq and any market on which the Company\u2019s shares may be listed in the future, impose various requirements on public companies, including those related to corporate governance practices. The Company\u2019s management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase the Company\u2019s legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly.\nSection 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, or Section 404, requires that we establish and maintain an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. Our annual reports on Form 10-K must contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that we have identified. The requirements of Section 404 are ongoing and also apply to future years. We expect that our internal control over financial reporting will continue to evolve as our business develops. Although we are committed to continue to improve our internal control processes and we will continue to diligently and vigorously review our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with Section 404 requirements, any control system, regardless of how well designed, operated and evaluated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Therefore, we cannot be certain that in the future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not exist or otherwise be discovered. If material weaknesses or other significant deficiencies occur, these weaknesses or deficiencies could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our consolidated financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or other material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nYou may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings.\nIn order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share paid by any investor. We may sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by any investor, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to you. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by any investor.\nIf our business plans are not successful, our stockholders may lose their entire investment in us.\nWe have historically incurred substantial losses to fund our business operations including our research and development activities. We will, in all likelihood, sustain operating expenses without corresponding revenues for the foreseeable future. This may result in our incurring net operating losses that will increase continuously until we are able to obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize, our product candidates, the occurrence of which cannot be assured. If our business plans are not successful, our stockholders may lose their entire investment in us.\nWe may be at risk of securities class action litigation or litigation initiated by individual stockholders.\nWe may be at risk of securities class action litigation or litigation initiated by individual stockholders. This risk is especially relevant due to our dependence on positive clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approvals. In the past, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility, particularly when associated with binary events such as clinical trials and product approvals. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business and result in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nIn the event we fail to satisfy any of the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted, which could affect our market price and liquidity.\nOur common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market. For continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market, we will be required to comply with the continued listing requirements, including the minimum market capitalization standard, the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirement, the corporate governance requirements and the\nminimum closing bid price requirement, maintaining Board diversity among other requirements. In the event that we fail to satisfy any of the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted. If our securities are delisted from trading on The NASDAQ Stock Market, however, and we are not able to list our securities on another exchange or to have them quoted on The NASDAQ Stock Market, our securities could be quoted on the OTC Markets or on the \u201cpink sheets.\u201d As a result, we could face significant adverse consequences including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf a determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which would require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities (including pursuant to short-form registration statements on Form S-3) or obtain additional financing in the future.\nIf we fail to comply with California laws governing the diversity of corporate boards of directors, we could be fined by the California Secretary of State.\nIn September 2018, California Governor Jerry Brown signed into law Senate Bill 826, or SB 826, which generally requires public companies with principal executive offices in California to have a minimum number of females on the company's board of directors. As of December 31, 2019, each public company with principal executive offices in California was required to have at least one female on its board of directors. By December 31, 2021, each public company would be required to have at least two females on its board of directors if the company has at least five directors, and at least three females on its board of directors if the company has at least six directors. Our Board is comprised of seven directors, two of whom are female and therefore, the Company is not in compliance with this requirement.\nAdditionally, on September 30, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law Assembly Bill 979, or AB 979, which generally requires public companies with principal executive offices in California to include specified numbers of directors from \"underrepresented communities.\" A director from an \"underrepresented community\" means a director who self-identifies as Black, African American, Hispanic, Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, Native Hawaiian, Alaska Native, gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. By December 31, 2021, each public company with principal executive offices in California is required to have at least one director from an underrepresented community. By December 31, 2022, a public company with more than four but fewer than nine directors will be required to have a minimum of two directors from underrepresented communities, and a public company with nine or more directors will need to have a minimum of three directors from underrepresented communities. Currently, the Company is in compliance with the diversity requirement of AB 979.\nOur board of directors includes two female directors, and one director from an \u201cunderrepresented community.\u201d If we do not add at least one additional female director and at least one director from an \u201cunderrepresented community\u201d to our board of directors prior to December 31, 2022, we would be out of compliance with SB 826 or AB 979, respectively. An initial violation of either law can result in a fine from the California Secretary of State in the amount of $100,000, with each subsequent violation resulting in a fine of $300,000. At this time, there is litigation challenging the enforceability of these bills and it is therefore uncertain whether any fines will be imposed.", "PERMNO": 92686, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CAPR"}
