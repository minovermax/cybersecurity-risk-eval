The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies. Specific risk factors related to our status as a controlled subsidiary of Dell overlapping business opportunities, Dell\u2019s ability to control certain transactions and resource allocations and related persons transactions with Dell and its other affiliated companies are set forth below under the heading \u201cRisks Related to Our Relationship with Dell.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are unable to predict the extent to which the global COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our business operations, financial performance, results of operations and stock price.\nThe coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have significantly curtailed the movement of people, goods and services worldwide, including in most or all of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations. The magnitude and duration of the resulting decline in business activity cannot currently be estimated with any degree of certainty and threatens to (1) negatively impact the demand for our products and services, (2) restrict our sales operations and marketing efforts, (3) disrupt the supply chain of hardware needed to operate our SaaS offerings, offer hardware appliances that integrated with our software products or run our business and (4) disrupt our ability to conduct product development and other important business activities. For example, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain industry events that we sponsor or at which we present and certain customer events have been canceled, postponed or moved to virtual-only experiences; we are encouraging all of our employees to work remotely; and we may deem it advisable to similarly alter, postpone or cancel entirely additional customer, employee or industry events in the future. Accordingly, we expect the COVID-19 pandemic to have a negative impact on our sales and our results of operations, the size and duration of which we are currently unable to predict. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of COVID-19 have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capital markets.\nOur success depends increasingly on customer acceptance of our newer products and services.\nOur products and services are primarily based on server virtualization and related compute technologies used for virtualizing on-premises data center servers, which form the foundation for private cloud computing. As the market for server virtualization continues to mature, the rate of growth in license sales of vSphere has declined. We are increasingly directing our product development and marketing efforts toward products and services that enable businesses to utilize virtualization as the foundation for private, public, hybrid and multi-cloud-based computing and mobile computing, including our vSphere-based SDDC products such as our vRealize management and automation offerings, vSAN storage virtualization offerings, and NSX offerings, as well as our Horizon client virtualization offerings, Unified Endpoint Management mobile device management offerings and our VMware Cloud on AWS offering. We have also been introducing SaaS versions of our on-premises products, including VMware Horizon Suite and certain Unified Endpoint Management offerings, and are working to extend our comprehensive data center virtualization and container platform into the public cloud and to introduce cloud products and services by investing in cloud and SaaS initiatives and partnering with public cloud providers such as AWS and IBM. Additionally, we announced the availability of Azure VMware Solutions in May 2019 and Google Cloud VMware Solution in July 2019, each through our partnership with CloudSimple (now a part of Google), and the availability of Oracle Cloud VMware Solution in September 2019. Recently, VMware has also begun to build, invest in, and acquire a range of SaaS and cloud-native technologies and products, including those acquired through our Heptio Inc., CloudHealth Technologies, Inc., and VeloCloud Networks, Inc. (\u201cVeloCloud\u201d) acquisitions, and we have launched managed subscription services such as VMware Cloud on AWS Outposts and our VMware Cloud on Dell EMC. In October 2019, we completed the acquisition of Carbon Black, which will form the nucleus of VMware\u2019s new set of enterprise security solutions focused on helping to provide advanced cybersecurity protection to customers. In December 2019, we completed the acquisition of Pivotal, which significantly increases our presence in the cloud-native applications segment. These cloud and SaaS initiatives present new and difficult technological, operational and compliance challenges, and significant investments continue to be required to develop or acquire solutions to address those challenges. Our success depends on our current and future customers perceiving technological and operational benefits and cost savings associated with adopting our private, hybrid and multi-cloud solutions and our client virtualization and mobile device management solutions. As the market for our server virtualization products continues to mature, and the scale of our business continues to increase, our rate of revenue growth increasingly depends upon the success of our newer product and service offerings. To the extent that our newer products and services are adopted more slowly than revenue growth in our established server virtualization offerings declines, our revenue growth rates may slow materially or our revenue may decline substantially, we may fail to realize returns on our investments in new initiatives and our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nA significant decrease in demand for our server virtualization products would adversely affect our operating results.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived, and will for the foreseeable future continue to be derived, from our server virtualization products. As more businesses achieve high levels of virtualization in their data centers, the market for our vSphere product continues to mature. Additionally, as businesses increasingly utilize public cloud and SaaS-based offerings, they are building more of their new compute workloads off-premises and are increasingly shifting some of their existing and many of their new workloads to public cloud providers, thereby limiting growth, and potentially reducing the market for on-premises deployments of vSphere. Although sales of vSphere have declined as a portion of our overall business, and we expect this trend to continue, vSphere remains key to our future growth as it serves as the foundation for our newer SDDC, network virtualization and our newer subscription and SaaS offerings. Although we have launched, and are continuing to develop,\nproducts to extend our vSphere-based SDDC offerings to the public cloud, due to our product concentration, a significant decrease in demand for our server virtualization products would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe face intense competition that could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe virtualization, container, cloud computing, end-user computing, security and software-defined data center industries are interrelated and rapidly evolving, and we face intense competition across all the markets for our products and services. Many of our current or potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. Additionally, the adoption of public cloud, micro-services, containers, and open source technologies has the potential to erode our profitability.\nWe face competition from, among others:\nProviders of public cloud infrastructure and SaaS-based offerings. As businesses increasingly utilize public cloud and SaaS-based offerings, they are building more of their new compute workloads off-premises and may also shift some of their existing workloads. As a result, the demand for on-premises IT resources is expected to slow, and our products and services will need to increasingly compete for customers\u2019 IT workloads with off-premises public cloud and SaaS-based offerings. If our private, hybrid and multi-cloud products and services fail to address evolving customer requirements, the demand for VMware\u2019s virtualization products and services may decline, and we could experience lower growth. Additionally, VCPP offerings from our partners may compete directly with IaaS offerings from various public cloud providers such as AWS and Microsoft. Many of these cloud providers are partnering with on-premises hardware vendors to deliver their cloud platform as an on-premises solution, including Azure Stack and AWS Outposts. In fiscal 2018, we entered into a strategic alliance with AWS to deliver a vSphere-based cloud service, VMware Cloud on AWS, running in AWS data centers available in certain geographies. In fiscal 2020, we also announced partnerships with Microsoft (Azure VMware Solution by CloudSimple), Google (Google Cloud VMware Solution by CloudSimple), and Oracle (Oracle Cloud VMware Solution) under the framework of our VCPP that enable customers to run native VMware-based workloads on Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud. Our partnerships with these public cloud providers may be seen as competitive with each other, with other VCPP partners and with AWS, while some partners may elect to include solutions such as VMware Cloud on AWS as part of their managed services provider offerings. In addition, in November 2018, when AWS announced AWS Outposts, we extended our collaboration with AWS by previewing offerings that will run on AWS Outposts, currently available to try as part of the VMware Cloud on AWS Outposts Beta program. To the extent customers choose to operate native AWS environments (or similar non-VMware environments, such as Azure Stack) in their data centers in lieu of purchasing VMware\u2019s on-premises and hybrid and multi-cloud products, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nProviders of enterprise security offerings. With the close of VMware\u2019s acquisition of Carbon Black in October 2019, we launched a new set of enterprise security solutions that includes the Carbon Black endpoint security platform and the intrinsic security elements of our existing NSX virtual networking, Workspace ONE end user and our compute offerings. The cybersecurity market is large, highly competitive, fragmented and subject to rapidly evolving technology, shifting customer needs and the frequent introductions of new solutions. Competitors in the end point security space include legacy antivirus solution providers such as McAfee and NortonLifeLock established software and infrastructure providers such as Blackberry Limited (after recently purchasing Cylance, Inc.) and Microsoft as well as next-generation endpoint security providers such as CrowdStrike. In addition, new startup companies and established companies have entered or are currently attempting to enter the next-generation endpoint security market. While we believe that the intrinsic security elements in our existing offerings coupled with our Carbon Black endpoint security offerings and new combined offerings we expect to develop and introduce in the future will enable us to provide an integrated security offering with significant advantages over our competitors\u2019 current offerings, our ability to gain traction and market share as a new entrant into this well-established market segment is uncertain. If our efforts to enter the enterprise security market segment are unsuccessful, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nLarge, diversified enterprise software and hardware companies. These competitors supply a wide variety of products and services to, and have well-established relationships with, our current and prospective end users. For example, small- to medium-sized businesses and companies in emerging markets that are evaluating the adoption of virtualization-based technologies and solutions may be inclined to consider Microsoft solutions because of their existing use of Windows and Office products. Some of these competitors have in the past and may in the future take advantage of their existing relationships to engage in business practices that make our products and services less attractive or more expensive to our end users. For example, in August 2019, Microsoft modified its on-premises licensing terms to require end users who wish to deploy Microsoft software on certain dedicated hosted cloud services other than Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud service, including VMware Cloud on AWS, to purchase additional rights from Microsoft. Other competitors have limited or denied support for their applications running in VMware virtualization environments. In addition, these competitors could integrate competitive capabilities into their existing products and services and make them available without additional charge. For example, Oracle provides free server virtualization software intended to support Oracle and non-Oracle applications, Microsoft offers its own server, network, and storage virtualization software packaged with its Windows Server product as well as built-in virtualization\nin the client version of Windows and Cisco includes network virtualization technology in many of their data center networking platforms. As a result, existing and prospective VMware customers may elect to use products that are perceived to be \u201cfree\u201d or \u201cvery low cost\u201d instead of purchasing VMware products and services for certain applications where they do not believe that more advanced and robust capabilities are required.\nCompanies offering competing platforms based on open source technologies. Open source technologies for virtualization, containerization and cloud platforms, such as Xen, KVM, Docker, rkt, OpenShift, Mesos, Kubernetes and OpenStack, and other open source software-based products, solutions and services developed by enterprise IT vendors that target data center virtualization and private cloud, such as Red Hat (now a part of IBM) and Nutanix, may reduce the demand for our solutions, put pricing pressure on our offerings and enable competing vendors to leverage open source technologies to compete directly with us. In addition, one of the characteristics of open source software is that, subject to specified restrictions, anyone may modify and redistribute existing open source software and use it to compete in the marketplace. Such competition can develop with a smaller degree of overhead and lead time than traditional proprietary software companies require. New platform technologies and standards based on open source software are consistently being developed and can gain popularity quickly. Improvements in open source software could cause customers to replace software purchased from us with open-source software. VMware is delivering container technologies, such as PKS, and Cloud Native Application technologies portfolio with VMware Tanzu. We have also increased our level of commitment to open source projects and communities like the Cloud Native Computing Foundation that are designed to increase the rate at which customers adopt micro-services architectures. The adoption of distributed micro-service application architectures, and their alignment with container technologies, represents an emerging area of competition. As we continue to invest in these areas, we will experience increasing competitive overlap with other cloud native vendors like Red Hat and the large providers of public cloud infrastructure. Such competitive pressure or the availability of new open source software may result in reduced sales, price reductions, lower operating margins and increased sales and marketing expenses, any one of which may adversely affect our operating results.\nOther industry alliances. Many of our competitors have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive virtualization and cloud computing solutions than they individually had offered. We expect these trends to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their positions in the evolving virtualization infrastructure and enterprise IT solutions industry. These alliances may result in more compelling product and service offerings than we offer.\nOur partners and members of our developer and technology partner ecosystem. We face competition from our partners. For example, third parties currently selling our products and services could build and market their own competing products and services or market competing products and services of other vendors. Additionally, as formerly distinct sectors of enterprise IT such as software-based virtualization and hardware-based server, networking and storage solutions converge, we also increasingly compete with companies who are members of our developer and technology partner ecosystem. For example, in July 2019, one of our important partners and customers, IBM, closed its acquisition of Red Hat, one of our competitors in the cloud native applications space. Consequently, we may find it more difficult to continue to work together productively on other projects, and the advantages we derive from our ecosystem could diminish.\nThis competition could result in increased pricing pressure and sales and marketing expenses, thereby materially reducing our operating margins, and could also prevent our new products and services from gaining market acceptance, thereby harming our ability to increase, or causing us to lose, market share.\nCompetition for our target employees is intense and costly, and we may not be able to attract and retain highly skilled employees.\nTo execute on our strategy, we must continue to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for senior sales executives and engineers with significant experience designing and developing software and cloud offerings. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. Research and development personnel are also aggressively recruited by startup and emerging growth companies, which are especially active in many of the technical areas and geographic regions in which we conduct product and service development. Competition for our key personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation and can have a dilutive impact on our stock. Additionally, changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or interpretation of such laws or regulations could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could suffer.\nAdverse economic conditions may harm our business.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for IT and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers. The purchase of our products and services is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other\nresources. Weak economic conditions or significant uncertainty regarding the stability of financial markets, including as a result of volatility in the stock market, recent changes in tariffs and trade agreements or the imposition of fines or government sanctions, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results in a number of ways, including by lengthening sales cycles, affecting the size of EAs that customers will commit to, reducing the level of our non-EA transactional sales, lowering prices for our products and services, reducing unit sales and reducing the rate of adoption of our products and services by new customers and the willingness of current customers to purchase upgrades to our existing products and services. For example, the economic impact of the coronavirus/COVID-19 is highly uncertain and will depend upon the ability to control its spread. Additionally, a recurrence of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, repercussions from the United Kingdom\u2019s (\u201cU.K.\u201d) exit from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) (\u201cBrexit\u201d) or that region\u2019s failure to sustain its recovery from recession would threaten to suppress demand and our customers\u2019 access to credit in that region which is an important market for our products and services. In addition, political and economic instability created by Brexit and trade tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets. In response to sustained economic uncertainty, many national and local governments that are current or prospective customers for our products and services, including the U.S. federal government, have made, or threatened to make, significant spending cutbacks which could reduce the amount of government spending on IT and the potential demand for our products and services from the government sector.\nRegional economic uncertainty can also result in general and ongoing tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy and significant volatility in the credit, equity and fixed income markets. Changes in governmental fiscal, monetary and tax policies may also impact interest rates on credit and debt, which have been at relatively low levels for several years. As a result, current or potential customers may be unable to fund software purchases, which could cause them to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services. Increases in our cost of borrowing could also impact our ability to access capital markets should we wish to raise additional funding for business investments, which could adversely affect our ability to repay or refinance our outstanding indebtedness, fund future product development and acquisitions or conduct stock buybacks.\nThe loss of key management personnel could harm our business.\nWe depend on the continued services of key management personnel. We generally do not have employment or non-compete agreements with our employees, and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time without penalty and could pursue employment opportunities with any of our competitors. In addition, we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The loss of key management personnel could harm our business.\nWe may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes with new solutions and services offerings.\nThe software-defined date center, hybrid and multi-cloud computing and end-user computing industries are characterized by rapid technological change, changing customer needs, frequent new software product introductions and evolving industry standards. The introduction of third-party solutions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could make our existing and future software solutions obsolete and unmarketable. Cloud computing has proven to be a disruptive technology that is altering the way that businesses consume, manage and provide physical IT resources, applications, data and IT services. We may not be able to establish or sustain our thought leadership in the cloud computing and enterprise software fields, and our customers may not view our products and services as cost effective, innovative and best-of-breed, which could result in a reduction in market share and our inability to command a pricing premium over competitor products and services. We may not be able to develop updated products and services that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards, that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers or that interoperate with new or updated operating systems and hardware devices. We may also fail to adequately anticipate and prepare for the commercialization of emerging technologies such as blockchain and the development of new markets and applications for our technology such as the Internet of Things and \u201cedge\u201d computing and thereby fail to take advantage of new market opportunities or fall behind early movers in those markets.\nOur ability to react quickly to new technology trends and customer requirements is negatively impacted by the length of our development cycle for new products and services and product and service enhancements, which has frequently been longer than we originally anticipated. This is due in part to the increasing complexity of our product offerings as we increase their interoperability, and enable and maintain their compatibility with multiple IT resources such as public clouds utilized by our customers, which can significantly increase the development time and effort necessary to achieve the interoperability of our offerings while maintaining product quality. When we release significant new versions of our existing offerings, the complexity of our products may require existing customers to remove and replace prior versions in order to take full advantage of substantial new features and capabilities, which may subdue initial demand for the new versions or, conversely, depress demand for existing versions until the customer is ready to purchase and install the newest release. If we are unable to evolve our solutions and offerings in time to respond to and remain ahead of new technological developments, our ability to retain or increase market share and revenue in the software-defined data center, hybrid and multi-cloud computing and end-user computing industries could be materially adversely affected. With respect to our SDDC products, if we fail to introduce compelling new features in future upgrades to our vSphere product line, manage the transition to hybrid and multi-cloud\nplatforms, develop new or tightly integrate existing applications for our virtualization technology that address customer requirements for integration, automation and management of their IT systems with public cloud resources, overall demand for products and services based on vSphere may decline. Additionally, if we fail to realize returns on investments in our newer NSX virtual networking, hyperconverged infrastructure, subscription and SaaS, and edge computing initiatives as well as our recently launched enterprise security and modern applications platform solutions, our operating margins and results of operations will be adversely impacted.\nBreaches of our cybersecurity systems or the systems of our vendors, partners and suppliers could seriously harm our business.\nWe depend upon our IT systems and the systems of SaaS providers to conduct virtually all of our business operations, ranging from our internal operations and product development activities to our marketing and sales efforts and communications with our customers and business partners. Consequently, cyber risks represent a large and growing risk to our business. We are increasingly developing and maintaining large data sets and relying on machine learning, artificial intelligence and analytics to provide services to our customers and partners. Unauthorized parties (which may have included nation states and individuals sponsored by them) have penetrated our network security and our website in the past and such unauthorized parties may do so in the future. Employees or contractors have introduced vulnerabilities in, and enabled the exploitation of, our IT environments in the past and may do so in the future. These cyber-attacks, which are increasing in number and technical sophistication, threaten to misappropriate our proprietary information, cause interruptions of our IT services and commit fraud. Because the techniques used by unauthorized persons to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these tactics. Further, if unauthorized access or sabotage remains undetected for an extended period of time, the effects of such breach could be exacerbated. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our systems and processes. Our exposure to cybersecurity threats and negative consequences of cybersecurity breaches will likely increase as our customers conduct more purchase and service transactions online, and as we store increasing amounts of customer data and host or manage parts of customers\u2019 businesses in cloud-based IT environments. Additionally, with our recent acquisition of endpoint security provider Carbon Black and the launch of our new set of enterprise security solutions, our products may be targeted by computer hackers seeking to compromise product security.\nWe are increasingly being targeted for financial gain and fraud by criminal entities. Utilizing techniques such as email, telephone and postal mail solicitation, criminals seek to extort or steal funds from the company and employees. We have also outsourced a number of our business functions to third parties, and we rely upon distributors, resellers, system vendors and systems integrators to sell our products and services. Accordingly, if our cybersecurity systems and those of our contractors, partners and vendors fail to protect against breaches, our ability to conduct our business could be damaged in a number of ways, including:\n\u2022\nsensitive data regarding our business, including intellectual property and other proprietary data, could be stolen;\n\u2022\nour electronic communications systems, including email and other methods, could be disrupted, and our ability to conduct our business operations could be seriously damaged until such systems can be restored and secured;\n\u2022\nour ability to process customer orders and electronically deliver products and services could be degraded, and our distribution channels could be disrupted, resulting in delays in revenue recognition;\n\u2022\ndefects and security vulnerabilities could be exploited or introduced into our software products or our subscription and SaaS offerings and impair or disrupt their availability, thereby damaging the reputation and perceived reliability and security of our products and services and potentially making the data systems of our customers vulnerable to further data loss and cyber incidents; and\n\u2022\npersonally identifiable or confidential data of our customers, employees and business partners could be stolen or lost.\nShould any of the above events occur, or are perceived to have occurred, we could be subject to significant claims for liability from our customers, we could face regulatory actions and sanctions from governmental agencies under privacy, data protection or other laws, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could be compromised, our reputation and competitive position could be materially harmed, we could face material losses as the result of successful financial cyber-fraud schemes and we could incur significant costs in order to upgrade our cybersecurity systems and remediate damages. Consequently, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nOur operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance. In addition, a significant portion of our quarterly sales typically occurs during\nthe last two weeks of the quarter, which generally reflects customer buying patterns for enterprise technology. As a result, our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict even in the near term. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or below any guidance we may provide to the market, the price of our Class A common stock would likely decline substantially.\nFactors that may cause fluctuations in our operating results include, among others, the factors described elsewhere in this risk factors section and the following:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand, adoption rates, sales cycles and pricing levels for our products and services;\n\u2022\nvariations in customer choices among our on-premises and subscription and SaaS offerings, which can impact our rates of total revenue and license revenue growth;\n\u2022\nchanges in customers\u2019 budgets for information technology purchases and in the timing of their purchasing decisions;\n\u2022\nthe timing of announcements or releases of new or upgraded products and services by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing and size of business realignment plans and restructuring charges;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain scalable internal systems for reporting, order processing, license fulfillment, product delivery, purchasing, billing and general accounting, among other functions;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;\n\u2022\nthe credit risks associated with our distributors, who account for a significant portion of our product revenue and accounts receivable, and our customers;\n\u2022\nthe timing of when sales orders are processed, which can cause fluctuations in our backlog and impact our bookings and timing of revenue recognition;\n\u2022\nseasonal factors such as the end of fiscal period budget expenditures by our customers and the timing of holiday and vacation periods;\n\u2022\nrenewal rates and the amounts of the renewals for EAs as original EA terms expire;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of internally developed software development costs that may be capitalized;\n\u2022\nunplanned events that could affect market perception of the quality or cost-effectiveness of our products and solutions;\n\u2022\nincreased volatility in the provision for income taxes in periods in which transfers of intellectual property between our legal entities occur; and\n\u2022\nour ability to accurately predict the degree to which customers will elect to purchase our subscription-based offerings in place of licenses to our on-premises offerings.\nAcquisitions and divestitures could harm our business and operating results.\nWe have acquired in the past, and plan to acquire in the future, other businesses, products or technologies. In October 2019, we completed our acquisition of Carbon Black, and in December 2019, we completed our acquisition of Pivotal. We also from time to time sell or divest businesses, products and technologies. Acquisitions and divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties, which include:\n\u2022\ndisrupting our ongoing operations and diverting management from day-to-day responsibilities;\n\u2022\nincreasing our expenses, and adversely impacting our business, financial condition and operating results, including, for example, the dilutive impact on our operating margin and earnings per share that we expect from our acquisitions of Carbon Black and Pivotal;\n\u2022\nthe costs of integrating business operations and on-boarding personnel, particularly for larger acquisitions such as Carbon Black and Pivotal;\n\u2022\nfailure of an acquired business to further our business strategy;\n\u2022\nuncertainties in achieving the expected benefits of an acquisition or disposition, including enhanced revenue, technology, human resources, cost savings, operating efficiencies and other synergies;\n\u2022\nreducing cash available for operations, stock repurchase programs and other uses and resulting in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022\nincurring amortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets acquired that could impact our operating results;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the operations, systems, technologies, products and personnel of acquired businesses effectively;\n\u2022\nthe need to provide transition services in connection with a disposition that may result in the diversion of resources and focus;\n\u2022\ndifficulty achieving expected business results due to a lack of experience in new markets, products or technologies or the initial dependence on unfamiliar distribution partners or vendors;\n\u2022\nretaining and motivating key personnel from acquired companies;\n\u2022\ndeclining employee morale and retention issues affecting employees of businesses that we acquire or dispose of, which may result from changes in compensation, or changes in management, reporting relationships, future prospects or the direction of the acquired or disposed business;\n\u2022\nassuming the liabilities of an acquired business, including acquired litigation-related liabilities and regulatory compliance issues, and potential litigation or regulatory action arising from a proposed or completed acquisition;\n\u2022\nlawsuits resulting from an acquisition or disposition;\n\u2022\nmaintaining good relationships with customers or business partners of an acquired business or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations or the divestiture of a business upon which our customers rely;\n\u2022\nunidentified issues not discovered during the diligence process, including issues with the acquired or divested business\u2019s intellectual property, product quality, security, privacy practices, accounting practices, regulatory compliance or legal contingencies;\n\u2022\nmaintaining or establishing acceptable standards, controls, procedures or policies with respect to an acquired business;\n\u2022\nrisks relating to the challenges and costs of closing a transaction;\n\u2022\nthe accounting consequences of certain acquisitions which may vary by deal structure, including, for instance, the need to account for our acquisition of Pivotal as a transaction between entities under common control, which requires prior period financial statements of VMware to be recast as if we had owned Pivotal and operated as one entity for all periods presented; and\n\u2022\nthe need to later divest acquired assets at a loss if an acquisition does not meet our expectations.\nWe are exposed to foreign exchange risks.\nBecause we conduct business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but report our operating results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. For example, political and economic instability created by Brexit has resulted in significant volatility in the value of the British pound and other currencies, including the euro. During the year ended January 31, 2020, approximately 30% of our sales were invoiced and collected in non-U.S. dollar denominated currencies. The realized gain or loss on foreign currency transactions is dependent upon the types of foreign currency transactions that we enter into, the exchange rates associated with these transactions and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts, and other factors. Although we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies have adversely affected, and may adversely affect in the future, our operating results. Any future weakening of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar would likely result in additional adverse impact on our revenue.\nWe operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks.\nOur international activities account for a substantial portion of our revenue and profits, a substantial portion of our employees work in non-U.S locations, and we plan to further expand internationally. In addition, our investment portfolio includes investments in non-U.S. financial instruments and holdings in non-U.S. financial institutions, including European institutions. In addition to the risks described elsewhere in these risk factors, our international operations subject us to a variety of risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles, especially in emerging markets;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in delivering support, training and documentation in certain foreign markets;\n\u2022\ntariffs and trade barriers, which could increase due to the current geopolitical climate, and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our products and services in certain foreign markets;\n\u2022\nchanges and instability in government policies and international trade arrangements that could adversely affect the ability of U.S.-based companies to conduct business in non-U.S. markets;\n\u2022\neconomic or political instability and security concerns in countries that are important to our international sales and operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in transferring funds from certain countries;\n\u2022\nincreased compliance risks, particularly in emerging markets; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining appropriate controls relating to revenue recognition practices.\nFor example, we currently comply with a number of EU regulations that govern our sales, facilities and employees located in the U.K. There continues to be considerable regulatory uncertainty regarding the impact of Brexit on the laws and regulations that we will need to comply with in the U.K. post-Brexit.\nAnother example is the ongoing efforts of the Chinese government to more closely regulate network security. In that respect, a Cyber Security Law came into effect on June 1, 2017. The Cyber Security Law promotes utilization of \u201csecure and reliable\u201d network products and services, requires the sale of certain key network equipment and network security products to be subject to security certification, and imposes data localization measures and various network security measures relevant to a vaguely-defined scope of \u201ccritical information infrastructure.\u201d Among those network security measures is a requirement that certain network products and services procured by operators of \u201ccritical information infrastructure\u201d undergo a formal security assessment in order to evaluate their \u201csecurity\u201d and \u201ccontrollability.\u201d The specific technical requirements of the security assessment have still not been fully defined. Regulations that are still in draft form contemplate more far-reaching data localization measures, which would require a security assessment be conducted for any business in China to share personal information or a vaguely-defined scope of \u201cimportant information\u201d with overseas parties.\nAlso, on January 1, 2016, an Anti-Terrorism Law came into effect in China that gives local public security and state security authorities the broad discretionary authority to require companies to provide access to their equipment and decryption support in particular cases. Failure to comply with such requests can result in fines and imprisonment. In addition, a broad range of businesses are required to verify the identities of customers and prohibited from providing services to customers whose identities are unclear or who refuse to cooperate in the verification process. If we are not able to, or choose not to, comply with these and other information and network security standards that the Chinese government might implement in the future, our business in China may suffer.\nThere is also significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.S. and various other countries, most significantly China, with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations, sanctions and tariffs. The current U.S. presidential administration is pursuing substantial changes to U.S. foreign trade policy with respect to China, the EU, Mexico and other countries, including the possibility of imposing greater restrictions on international trade, restrictions on sales and technology transfers, including those countries and companies determined to be involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign or economic policy interests of the U.S., and significant increases of tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. Given the relatively fluid regulatory environment in both China and the U.S. and uncertainty regarding how the U.S. and foreign governments will act with respect to tariffs, international trade agreements and policies and national security interests, a trade war, further governmental action related to tariffs or international trade policies, or additional tax or other regulatory changes or enforcement practices could occur in the future and could directly and adversely impact our financial results and results of operations.\nFurthermore, if we fail to comply with legal and regulatory requirements covering the foreign activities of U.S. corporations, such as export control requirements and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as with local regulatory requirements in non-U.S. jurisdictions, we may be exposed to significant fines and penalties and reputational harm. These risks will increase as we expand our operations in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices.\nIn addition, potential fallout from past disclosures related to the U.S. Internet and communications surveillance and possible efforts to enable increased surveillance could make foreign customers reluctant to purchase products and services from U.S.-based technology companies and impair our growth rate in foreign markets.\nOur failure to manage any of these risks successfully could negatively affect our reputation and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have outstanding indebtedness in the form of unsecured notes and may incur other debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.\nWe have $4.0 billion in unsecured notes outstanding as well as an additional unsecured promissory note with an outstanding principal amount of $270 million owed to Dell. We also have a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which is currently undrawn, and a $2.0 billion senior unsecured 364-day term loan facility, which, as of January 31, 2020, had an outstanding balance of $1.5 billion (collectively, the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d). Our current and any future debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other things:\n\u2022\nrequiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.\nThe terms of our unsecured notes and Credit Facilities impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified and customary covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial, and industry conditions. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or note holders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable.\nIn addition, any actual or anticipated changes to our credit ratings, including any announcement that our credit ratings are under review by any rating agency, may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities. Under certain circumstances, if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us and the cost of borrowing under our Credit Facilities could increase. Downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of and restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain downgrades of the ratings of our unsecured notes, we may be required to repurchase our unsecured notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the date of purchase.\nAdditionally, our parent company, Dell, currently has a significant level of debt financing. Accordingly, negative changes to Dell\u2019s credit rating could also negatively impact our credit rating and the value and liquidity of any future debt we might raise. Refer to \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our outstanding indebtedness.\nOur current research and development efforts may not produce significant revenue for several years, if at all.\nDeveloping our products and services is expensive. In particular, developing and launching disruptive technologies in new areas, as we are continuing to do with our NSX virtual networking, hyperconverged infrastructure, subscription and SaaS, security and modern applications platform initiatives, requires significant investments of resources and often entails greater risk than incremental investments in existing products and services. Our investment in research and development may not result in marketable products or services or may result in products and services that generate less revenue than we anticipate. Our research and development expenses were approximately 23% of our total revenue during the year ended January 31, 2020. Our future plans include significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we may not receive significant revenue from these investments for several years, if at all.\nWe are involved in litigation, investigations and regulatory inquiries and proceedings that could negatively affect us.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in various legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and investigations relating to our business, which may include claims with respect to commercial, product liability, intellectual property, cybersecurity, privacy, data protection, antitrust, breach of contract, employment, class action, whistleblower, mergers and acquisitions and other matters. In the ordinary course of business, we also receive inquiries from and have discussions with government entities regarding the compliance of our contracting and sales practices with laws and regulations.\nWe have been, and expect to continue to be, subject to intellectual property infringement claims, including claims by entities that do not have operating businesses of their own and therefore may limit our ability to seek counterclaims for damages and injunctive relief. In addition to monetary judgments, a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products. In addition, we might be required to seek a license for the use of such intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers and channel partners, which could require us to initiate or defend potentially protracted and costly litigation on their behalf, regardless of the merits of these claims, because we generally indemnify our customers and channel partners from claims of infringement of proprietary rights of third parties in\nconnection with the use of our products. These matters can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Allegations made in the course of regulatory or legal proceedings may also harm our reputation, regardless of whether there is merit to such claims. Furthermore, because litigation and the outcome of regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings, claims, demands or investigations.\nRefer to Note E to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of certain claims and litigation.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. As such, despite our efforts, the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain, particularly in countries outside of the U.S. In addition, we rely on confidentiality and license agreements with third parties in connection with their use of our products and technology. There is no guarantee that such parties will abide by the terms of such agreements or that we will be able to adequately enforce our rights, in part because we rely on \u201cclick-wrap\u201d and \u201cshrink-wrap\u201d licenses in some instances.\nDetecting and protecting against the unauthorized use of our products, technology proprietary rights and intellectual property rights is expensive, difficult, uncertain and, in some cases, impossible. Litigation is necessary from time to time to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property, which could result in a substantial loss of our market share.\nOur use of \u201copen source\u201d software in our products could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and subject us to litigation.\nMany of our products and services incorporate so-called \u201copen source\u201d software, and we may incorporate open source software into other products and services in the future. Open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. Open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or assurance of title or controls on origin of the software, which exposes us to potential liability if the software fails to work or infringes the intellectual property of a third party.\nWe monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend and avoid exposing us to unacceptable financial risk. However, the processes we follow to monitor our use of open source software could fail to achieve their intended result. In addition, although we believe that we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software that we use, there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of terms in most of these licenses, which increases the risk that a court could interpret the licenses differently than we do.\nFrom time to time, we receive inquiries or claims from authors or distributors of open source software included in our products regarding our compliance with the conditions of one or more open source licenses. An adverse outcome to a claim could require us to:\n\u2022\npay significant damages;\n\u2022\nstop distributing our products that contain the open source software;\n\u2022\nrevise or modify our product code to remove alleged infringing code;\n\u2022\nrelease the source code of our proprietary software; or\n\u2022\ntake other steps to avoid or remedy an alleged infringement.\nWe have faced and successfully defended against allegations of copyright infringement and failing to comply with the terms of the open sources General Public License v.2, but we can provide no assurances that we will not face similar lawsuits with respect to our use of open source software in the future, nor what the outcome of any such lawsuits may be.\nThe evolution of our business requires more complex go-to-market strategies, which involve significant risk.\nOur increasing focus on developing and marketing IT management and automation and IaaS (including software-defined networking, VCPP-integrated virtual desktop and mobile device, cloud and SaaS) offerings that enable customers to transform their IT systems requires a greater focus on marketing and selling product suites and more holistic solutions, rather than selling on a product-by-product basis. Consequently, we have developed, and must continue to develop, new strategies for marketing and selling our offerings. In addition, marketing and selling new technologies to enterprises requires significant investment of\ntime and resources in order to educate customers on the benefits of our new product offerings. These investments can be costly and the additional effort required to educate both customers and our own sales force can distract from their efforts to sell existing products and services. From time to time, we may choose to reorganize our go-to-market teams in an effort to better leverage investments in our sales efforts by increasing efficiencies and improving customer coverage. These reorganizations can cause short-term disruptions that may negatively impact sales over one or more fiscal periods. For example, during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, our sales in the Americas grew more slowly than in other geographies, which may have been due in part to a reorganization of our go-to-market resources in that region. There is no assurance that this reorganization or similar reorganizations will not negatively impact sales in future quarters. Further, upon entering into new industry segments, we may choose to go to market with hardware appliances that are integrated with our software-as we did when we entered into the SD-WAN space through our acquisitions of VeloCloud and Nyansa, Inc.-which requires us to rapidly develop, deploy and scale new hardware procurement, supply chain and inventory management processes and product support services and integrate them into our ongoing business systems and controls. Similarly, our plans to launch managed subscription services such as VMware Cloud on AWS and VMware Cloud on Dell EMC will require us to implement new methods to deliver and monitor end user services and adjust our model for releasing product upgrades.\nOur success depends upon our ability to develop appropriate business and pricing models.\nIf we cannot adapt our business models to keep pace with industry trends, including the industry-wide transition to cloud-based computing, our revenue could be negatively impacted. Certain of our product initiatives, such as our VCPP and SaaS offerings, have a subscription model. As we increase our adoption of subscription-based pricing models for our products, we may fail to set pricing at levels appropriate to maintain our revenue streams or our customers may choose to deploy products from our competitors that they believe are priced more favorably. In addition, we may fail to accurately predict subscription renewal rates or their impact on operating results, and because revenue from subscriptions is recognized for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our results. Additionally, as customers transition to our subscription and SaaS products and services, our revenue and license revenue growth rate may be adversely impacted during the period of transition as we will recognize less revenue up front than we would otherwise recognize as part of the multi-year license contracts through which we typically sell our established offerings. For example, effective with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we commenced reporting revenue from our subscription and SaaS as a separate revenue line item, breaking out components that had previously been included in our license revenue and services revenue. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. As a result, the rate of growth in our license revenue, which has been viewed as a leading indicator of our business performance may appear to be negatively impacted while the growth in subscription and SaaS revenue may not appear as robust because such revenue is recognized ratably over time as customers consume our subscription-based products. Finally, as we offer more services that depend on converting users of free services to users of premium services and converting purchasers of our on-premises products to our SaaS offerings, and as such services grow in size, our ability to maintain or improve and to predict conversion rates will become more important.\nOur products and services are highly technical and may contain or be subject to other suppliers\u2019 errors, defects or security vulnerabilities.\nOur products and services are highly technical and complex and, when deployed, have contained and may contain errors, defects or security vulnerabilities. Some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been installed and used by customers. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our customers to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Further, our use of open-source software in our offerings can make our products and services vulnerable to additional security risks not posed by proprietary products. In the past, VMware has been made aware of public postings by hackers of portions of our source code. It is possible that the released source code could expose unknown security vulnerabilities in our products and services that could be exploited by hackers or others. VMware products and services are also subject to known and unknown security vulnerabilities resulting from integration with products or services of other companies (such as applications, operating systems or semi-conductors). For example, vulnerabilities in certain microprocessors were publicly announced in 2018 under the names Spectre, Meltdown and Foreshadow. Actual or perceived errors, defects or security vulnerabilities in our products or services could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products or services, reduce or delay future purchases or use competitive products or services, all of which could negatively impact our business, operating results and stock price.\nOur subscription and SaaS offerings, which constitute a growing portion of our business, and our initiatives to extend our data center virtualization and container platforms into the public cloud, involve various risks, including, among others, reliance on third-party providers for data center space and colocation services and on public cloud providers to prevent service disruptions.\nAs we continue to develop and offer subscription and SaaS versions of our products, we will need to continue to evolve our processes to meet a number of regulatory, intellectual property, contractual and service compliance challenges. These\nchallenges include compliance with licenses for open source and third-party software embedded in our subscription and SaaS offerings, maintaining compliance with export control and privacy regulations, including HIPAA, protecting our services from external threats, maintaining the continuous service levels and data security expected by our customers, preventing the inappropriate use of our services and adapting our go-to-market efforts. The expansion of our subscription and SaaS offerings also requires significant investments, and our operating margins, results of operations and operating cash flows may be adversely affected if our new offerings are not widely adopted by customers.\nAdditionally, our subscription and SaaS offerings rely upon third-party providers to supply data center space, equipment maintenance and other colocation services and our initiatives to extend our virtualization and container platforms into the public cloud rely upon the ability of our public cloud and VCPP partners to maintain continuous service availability and protect customer data on their services. Although we have entered into various agreements for the lease of data center space, equipment maintenance and other services, third parties could fail to live up to the contractual obligations under those agreements. The failure of a third-party provider to prevent service disruptions, data losses or security breaches may require us to issue credits or refunds or indemnify or otherwise be liable to customers or third parties for damages that may occur and contractual provisions with our third-party providers and public cloud partners may limit our recourse against the third-party provider or public cloud partner responsible for such failure. Additionally, if these third-party providers fail to deliver on their obligations, our reputation could be damaged, our customers could lose confidence in us and our ability to maintain and expand our subscription and SaaS offerings would be impaired.\nFailure to effectively manage our product and service lifecycles could harm our business.\nAs part of the natural lifecycle of our products and services, we periodically inform customers that products or services will be reaching their end of life or end of availability and will no longer be supported or receive updates and security patches. To the extent these products or services remain subject to a service contract with the customer, we offer to transition the customer to alternative products or services. Failure to effectively manage our product and service lifecycles could lead to customer dissatisfaction and contractual liabilities, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur success depends on the interoperability of our products and services with those of other companies.\nThe success of our products depends upon the cooperation of hardware and software vendors to ensure interoperability with our products and offer compatible products and services to end users. In addition, we have begun to extend the functionality of various products to work with native public cloud applications, which may require the cooperation of public cloud vendors. To the extent that hardware, software and public cloud vendors perceive that their products and services compete with ours or those of our controlling stockholder, Dell, they may have an incentive to withhold their cooperation, decline to share access or sell to us their proprietary APIs, protocols or formats, or engage in practices to actively limit the functionality, compatibility and certification of our products. In addition, vendors may fail to certify or support or continue to certify or support our products for their systems. If any of the foregoing occurs, our product development efforts may be delayed or foreclosed and it may be difficult and more costly for us to achieve functionality and service levels that would make our services attractive to end users, any of which could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nDisruptions to our distribution channels could harm our business.\nOur future success is highly dependent on our relationships with distributors, resellers, system vendors and systems integrators, which account for a significant portion of our revenue. Recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use of our technology and product offerings requires significant time and resources. Our failure to maintain good relationships with channel partners would likely lead to a loss of end users of our products and services, which would adversely affect our revenue. We generally do not have long-term contracts or minimum purchase commitments with our distributors, resellers, system vendors and systems integrators, and our contracts with these channel partners do not prohibit them from offering products or services that compete with ours.\nTwo of our distributors each accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue during the year ended January 31, 2020. Although we believe that we have in place, or would have in place by the date of any such termination, agreements with replacement distributors sufficient to maintain our revenue from distribution, if we were to lose the distribution services of a significant distributor, such loss could have a negative impact on our operating results until such time as we arrange to replace these distribution services with the services of existing or new distributors.\nJoint ventures may not yield expected benefits and outcomes.\nAs we expand our offerings into new technologies such as the public cloud and seek more efficient methods of marketing our products and services in regions where local partners can operate more easily, we sometimes rely upon joint ventures with established providers of IT products and services in particular regions, for example as go-to-market and channel partners. Joint ventures are inherently risky and the requirements for close ongoing cooperation and commitments from the joint venture partners to devote adequate resources often present significant challenges. Joint ventures can also be difficult to manage, given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners. Accordingly, there can be no guarantee that our joint ventures will\nachieve their intended objectives. If we are unable to continue our strategic alignment with joint venture partners or obtain the cooperation and commitments we are relying upon, our ability to successfully expand our offerings globally and in certain regions may diminish.\nNon-compliance or perceived non-compliance with existing and evolving international and domestic privacy and data protection laws, regulations and standards could result in liability and adversely impact our business.\nOur business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and international governmental agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing privacy and data protection laws. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is rapidly evolving, as many new laws, regulations and standards regarding the collection, location, use and disclosure of personal information are being adopted, and existing laws and regulations may be subject to new and changing interpretations, creating uncertainty and additional legal obligations for ourselves, our partners, vendors and customers for the foreseeable future. For example, the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d) came into force in May 2018 and established new requirements applicable to the handling of personal data; the California Consumer Privacy Act, which came into effect in January 2020, broadly defines personal information and provides California consumers increased privacy rights and protections; and the EU\u2019s proposed e-Privacy Regulation regulates the use of information for marketing purposes and the tracking of individuals\u2019 online activities. Additionally, the application of law and regulations to our role as a provider of cloud-based compute infrastructure delivered by third party cloud providers is uncertain. We expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards, including self-regulatory standards advocated by industry groups, concerning privacy, data protection and transfers, and information security in the U.S., EU and other jurisdictions globally, and we cannot yet determine the impacts such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business or the businesses of our partners, vendors and customers.\nWe continue to make investments in and enhance our policies and controls across our business relating to how we and our business partners protect, collect and use customer and employee personal data, as U.S. and international regulatory frameworks evolve. Ongoing compliance efforts may increase the cost and complexity of our business relationships and the delivery of our products and services and may negatively impact our business, our ability to run promotions and effectively market our offerings, and the demand for our products and services.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us or our business partners to comply with such federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations, the privacy commitments contained in our contracts or the privacy policies we have posted on our website could subject us to investigations, sanctions, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal liability, penalties or injunctions. For example, failure to comply with the EU\u2019s GDPR requirements may lead to fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the infringer, whichever is greater. Additionally, as a technology provider, our customers expect that we can demonstrate compliance with current data privacy and data protection laws and regulations, and our inability or perceived inability to do so may adversely impact sales of our products and services, particularly to customers in highly-regulated industries. As a result, our reputation and brand may be harmed, we could incur significant costs, and financial and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations, our business could be adversely affected.\nContracts, including contracts entered into by companies we acquire, with many customers include unique and specialized performance requirements. In particular, our contracts with federal, state, local and non-U.S. governmental customers and our arrangements with distributors and resellers who may sell directly to governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations, contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance. Any failure by us to comply with provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments and, in the case of our government contracts, fines and suspension from future government contracting. Further, any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them, regardless of its accuracy, may damage our business and affect our ability to compete for new contracts. In the ordinary course of business, we also receive inquiries from and have ongoing discussions with government entities regarding the compliance of our contracting and sales practices with laws and regulations. A failure in the future to comply with federal and state governmental contracting requirements could result in the termination of customer contracts, our suspension from government work, the imposition of fines or other government sanctions or an inability to compete for new contracts, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe may not realize all the economic benefit from our business acquisitions, which could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. As of January 31, 2020, goodwill and amortizable intangible assets were $9.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. We review our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may lead to impairment include a substantial decline in stock price and market capitalization or cash flows, reduced future cash flow estimates related to the assets and slower growth rates in our industry. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, which would negatively impact our operating results.\nProblems with our information systems could interfere with our business and could adversely impact our operations.\nWe rely on our information systems and those of third parties for processing customer orders, delivering products, providing services and support to our customers, billing and tracking our customer orders, fulfilling contractual obligations, performing accounting operations and otherwise running our business. If our systems fail, our disaster and data recovery planning and capacity may prove insufficient to enable timely recovery of important functions and business records. Any disruption in our information systems and those of the third parties upon whom we rely could have a significant impact on our business.\nIn addition, we continuously work to enhance our information systems, such as our enterprise resource planning software. The implementation of these types of enhancements is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise, which may especially be the case for us due to the size and complexity of our business. Implementation may disrupt internal controls and business processes and could introduce unintended vulnerability to error.\nAdditionally, our information systems may not support new business models and initiatives and significant investments could be required in order to upgrade them. For example, during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we implemented a new lease accounting software in order to facilitate the preparation of financial information related to the adoption of accounting standard updates.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities, and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions and the timing of recognizing revenue and expenses. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are subject to income and indirect tax examinations. The Dell-owned EMC consolidated group is routinely under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d). All U.S. federal income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2015 while VMware was part of the Dell-owned EMC consolidated group. The IRS has started its examination of fiscal years 2015 through 2019 for the Dell consolidated group, which VMware was part of beginning fiscal year 2017. In addition, we are under corporate income tax audits in various states and non-U.S. jurisdictions. While we believe we have complied with all applicable income tax laws, a governing tax authority could have a different interpretation of the law and may assess us with additional taxes. In addition, regulatory guidance is still forthcoming with respect to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d) and such guidance may adversely impact our tax provision. Any assessment of additional taxes could materially affect our financial condition and operating results.\nOur future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, changes in our business or statutory rates, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations, our acquisition of Pivotal, which was accounted for as a common control transaction, shifts in the amount of earnings in the U.S. compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax, changes in our international organization, as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of our global business, there are many intercompany transactions, including the transfer of intellectual property, where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may differ from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\nOur effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in the U.S. and in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the U.S. statutory rate. Our non-U.S. earnings are primarily earned by our subsidiaries organized in Ireland where the rate of taxation is lower than our U.S. tax rate, and as such, our annual effective tax rate can be significantly affected by the composition of our earnings in the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. During October 2014, Ireland announced revisions to its tax regulations that will require foreign earnings of our subsidiaries organized in Ireland to be taxed at higher rates. We will be impacted by the changes in tax laws in Ireland beginning in 2021. In addition, we will be impacted by changes in tax laws in Bermuda and may be impacted by changes in other jurisdictions in 2019 and through 2021. We may proactively make structural changes in Ireland that may reduce the impact to our future tax rates. Currently, there are certain structural changes in Ireland that may be available to multi-national companies. However, due to the acquisition of\nEMC, VMware\u2019s parent company, by Dell effective September 7, 2016 (the \u201cDell Acquisition\u201d), we could be subject to higher tax obligations in the event we executed similar structural changes.\nAny other significant changes to U.S. or international tax laws could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, financial condition, operating results and timing and amount of tax payments.\nIn addition, numerous other countries have recently enacted or are considering enacting changes to tax laws, administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions. These changes could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities.\nNatural disasters, catastrophic events or geo-political conditions could disrupt our business.\nOur worldwide operations are dependent on our network infrastructure, internal technology systems and website. Significant portions of our intellectual property and personnel, including our corporate headquarters, are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. We also have operations in various domestic and international locations that expose us to additional diverse risks. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, flood or other act of God, or pandemics, such as the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results. Abrupt political change, terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, and disease pandemics could temporarily sideline a substantial part of our or our customers\u2019 workforce at any particular time, any of which could disrupt our business. Furthermore, some of our new product initiatives and business functions are hosted and carried out by third parties that may be vulnerable to disruptions of these sorts, many of which may be beyond our control. Unanticipated disruptions in services provided through localized physical infrastructure, such as utility or telecommunication outages, or pandemics, such as the recent outbreak of COVID-19, or other unanticipated catastrophes, can curtail the functioning of local offices as well as critical components of our information systems, and adversely affect our ability to process orders, provide services, respond to customer requests and maintain local and global business continuity. To the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, or the deployment or availability of our products and services, our revenue would be adversely affected. Additionally, any such catastrophic event could cause us to incur significant costs to repair damages to our facilities, equipment and infrastructure.\nChanges in accounting principles and guidance could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to create and interpret appropriate accounting principles and guidance. A change in these principles or guidance, or in their interpretations, may have a material effect on our reported results, as well as our processes and related controls, and may retroactively affect previously reported results. For example, during February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The updated standard required the recognition of a liability for lease obligations and a corresponding right-of-use asset on the balance sheet, and disclosures of certain information regarding leasing arrangements. We adopted this standard beginning with our first quarter of fiscal 2020 and applied it retrospectively at the beginning of the period of adoption through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with Dell\nOur relationship with Dell may adversely impact our business and stock price.\nAs of January 31, 2020, Dell beneficially owned 30,678,605 shares of our Class A common stock and all 307,221,836 shares of our Class B common stock, representing 80.9% of the total outstanding shares of common stock or 97.5% of the voting power of outstanding common stock held by EMC, and we are considered a \u201ccontrolled\u201d company under the rules of the NYSE. Accordingly, strategic and business decisions made by Dell can impact our strategic and business decisions and relationships, and public speculation regarding Dell\u2019s strategic direction and prospects, as well as our relationship with Dell, can cause our stock price to fluctuate.\nFor example, during 2018, Dell announced that it was reviewing its strategic opportunities, including a possible business combination with us, a review that led to Dell\u2019s exchange of its Class V common stock designed to track our financial performance for its Class C common stock and our payment of a special cash dividend totaling $11.0 billion. Throughout that year, the stock price of our Class A common stock experienced periods of significant volatility related to public speculation regarding the outcome of Dell\u2019s strategic review and the likelihood of its success. Additionally, speculation regarding how our relationship with Dell might be affected by Dell\u2019s status as a publicly traded company or additional strategic transactions involving Dell, such as our acquisition of Pivotal in December 2019, creates uncertainty for our stockholders, customers, partners and employees, which could negatively impact sales, make it difficult to attract and retain employees and distract management\u2019s focus from executing on other strategic initiatives.\nA number of other factors relating to our relationship with Dell could adversely affect our business or our stock price in the future, including:\n\u2022\nDell is able to control matters requiring our stockholders\u2019 approval, including the election of a majority of our directors as described in the risk factors below.\n\u2022\nDell could implement changes to our business, including changing our commercial relationship with Dell or taking other corporate actions, such as participating in business combinations, that our other stockholders may not view as beneficial.\n\u2022\nWe have arrangements with a number of companies that compete with Dell, and our relationship with Dell could adversely affect our relationships with these companies or other customers, suppliers and partners.\n\u2022\nSince the Dell Acquisition, the portion of our bookings that are realized through Dell sales channels has grown more rapidly than our sales through non-Dell resellers and distributors, and we expect this trend to continue. To the extent that we find ourselves relying more heavily upon Dell for our channel sales, Dell\u2019s leverage over our sales and marketing efforts may increase and our ability to negotiate favorable go-to-market arrangements with Dell and with other channel partners may decline.\n\u2022\nDell has a right to approve certain matters under our certificate of incorporation, including acquisitions or investments in excess of $100 million, and Dell may choose not to consent to matters that our board of directors believes are in the best interests of VMware.\n\u2022\nSynergies and benefits that we expect from our relationship with Dell may not be realized.\n\u2022\nDell is highly leveraged and commits a substantial portion of its cash flows to servicing its indebtedness. Dell\u2019s significant debt could create the perception that Dell may exercise its control over us to limit our growth in favor of its other businesses or cause us to transfer cash to Dell. In addition, if Dell defaults, or appears in danger of defaulting, on its indebtedness, uncertainty as to the impact of such a default on VMware could disrupt our business.\n\u2022\nInvestor perceptions of Dell\u2019s performance, future plans and prospects could contribute to volatility in the price of our Class A common stock.\n\u2022\nSome of our products compete directly with products sold or distributed by Dell, which could result in reduced sales.\nHolders of our Class A common stock have limited ability to influence matters requiring stockholder approval.\nAs of January 31, 2020, Dell controlled 80.9% of the total outstanding shares of common stock, including all of our outstanding Class B common stock, representing 97.5% of the voting power of our total outstanding common stock. Through its control of the Class B common stock, which is generally entitled to 10 votes per share, Dell controls the vote to elect all of our directors and to approve or disapprove all other matters submitted to a stockholder vote.\nPrior to a distribution by Dell to its stockholders under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (a \u201c355 Distribution\u201d), shares of Class B common stock transferred to any party other than a successor-in-interest or a subsidiary of EMC automatically convert into Class A common stock. Dell\u2019s voting control over VMware will continue so long as the shares of Class B common stock it controls continue to represent at least 20% of our outstanding stock. If its ownership falls below 20% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, all outstanding shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert to Class A common stock. If Dell effects a 355 Distribution at a time when it holds shares of Class B common stock, its stockholders will receive Class B common stock. These shares will remain entitled to 10 votes per share, holders of these shares will remain entitled to elect 80% of the total number of directors on our board of directors and the holders of our Class A common stock will continue to have limited ability to influence matters requiring stockholder approval and have limited ability to elect members of our board of directors. Following a 355 Distribution, shares of Class B common stock may convert to Class A common stock if such conversion is approved by VMware stockholders after the 355 Distribution and we have obtained a private letter ruling from the IRS. In January 2014, the IRS announced in Revenue Procedure 2014-3 that, generally, it would no longer issue private letter rulings on 355 Distributions.\nDell has the ability to prevent us from taking actions that might be in our best interest.\nUnder our certificate of incorporation and the master transaction agreement we entered into with EMC, we must (subject to certain exceptions) obtain the consent of EMC (which is controlled by Dell) or its successor-in-interest, as the holder of our Class B common stock, prior to taking specified actions, such as acquiring other companies for consideration in excess of $100 million, issuing stock or other VMware securities, except pursuant to employee benefit plans (provided that we obtain Class B common stockholder approval of the aggregate annual number of shares to be granted under such plans), paying dividends, entering into any exclusive or exclusionary arrangement with a third party involving, in whole or in part, products or services that are similar to EMC\u2019s or amending certain provisions of our charter documents. In addition, we have agreed that for so long as EMC or its successor-in-interest continues to own greater than 50% of the voting control of our outstanding common\nstock, we will not knowingly take or fail to take any action that could reasonably be expected to preclude the ability of EMC or its successor-in-interest (including Dell) to undertake a tax-free spin-off. If Dell does not provide any requisite consent allowing us to conduct such activities when requested, we will not be able to conduct such activities. As a result, we may have to forgo capital raising or acquisition opportunities that would otherwise be available to us, and we may be precluded from pursuing certain growth initiatives.\nBy becoming a stockholder in our company, holders of our Class A common stock are deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and the master transaction agreement with respect to the limitations that are described above.\nDell has the ability to prevent a change-in-control transaction and may sell control of VMware without benefiting other stockholders.\nDell\u2019s voting control and its additional rights described above give Dell the ability to prevent transactions that would result in a change of control of VMware, including transactions in which holders of our Class A common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then-current market price. In addition, Dell is not prohibited from selling a controlling interest in us to a third party and may do so without the approval of the holders of our Class A common stock and without providing for a purchase of any shares of Class A common stock held by persons other than Dell. Accordingly, shares of Class A common stock may be worth less than they would be if Dell did not maintain voting control over us or if Dell did not have the additional rights described above.\nIf Dell\u2019s level of ownership significantly increases, Dell could unilaterally effect a merger of VMware into Dell without a vote of VMware stockholders or the VMware Board of Directors at a price per share that might not reflect a premium to then-current market prices.\nAs of January 31, 2020, Dell controlled 80.9% of VMware\u2019s outstanding common stock, and Dell\u2019s percentage ownership of VMware common stock could increase as a result of repurchases by VMware of its Class A common stock or purchases by Dell. Section 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law permits a parent company, when it owns 90% or more of each class of a subsidiary\u2019s stock that generally would be entitled to vote on a merger of that subsidiary with the parent, to unilaterally effect a merger of the subsidiary into the parent without a vote of the subsidiary\u2019s board or stockholders. Accordingly, if Dell becomes the holder of at least 90% of VMware\u2019s outstanding stock, neither VMware\u2019s board of directors nor VMware\u2019s stockholders would be entitled to vote on a merger of VMware into Dell (the \u201cshort-form merger\u201d). Moreover, a short-form merger is not subject to the stringent \u201centire fairness\u201d standard and the parent company is not required to negotiate with a special committee of disinterested directors that would serve to approximate arm\u2019s length negotiations designed to ensure that a fair price is paid. Rather, a minority stockholder\u2019s sole remedy in the context of a short-form merger is to exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law. In such a proceeding, petitioning stockholders may be awarded more or less than the merger price or the amount they would have received in a merger negotiated between the parent and a disinterested special committee advised by independent financial and legal advisors. Pursuant to a letter agreement entered into by VMware and Dell on July 1, 2018, until the ten-year anniversary of the agreement, Dell may not purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of common stock of VMware if such acquisition would cause the common stock of VMware to no longer be publicly traded on a U.S. securities exchange or VMware to no longer be required to file reports under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act, in each case, unless such transaction has been approved in advance by a special committee of the VMware Board of Directors comprised solely of independent and disinterested directors or such acquisition of VMware common stock is required in order for VMware to continue to be a member of the affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated tax return with Dell.\nWe engage in related persons transactions with Dell that may divert our resources, create opportunity costs and prove to be unsuccessful.\nWe currently engage in a number of related persons transactions with Dell that include joint product development, go-to-market, branding, sales, customer service activities, real estate and various support services, and we expect to engage in additional related persons transactions with Dell to leverage the benefits of our strategic alignment. For example, in December 2019, we acquired Pivotal, a then majority owned subsidiary of Dell and a company in which we held a significant ownership interest. Additionally, in December 2019, personnel in the Dell Technologies Consulting group who provide professional services for VMware product offerings to Dell customers transferred to VMware\u2019s professional services group.\nWe believe that these related persons transactions provide us a unique opportunity to leverage the respective technical expertise, product strengths and market presence of Dell and its subsidiaries for the benefit of our customers and stockholders while enabling us to compete more effectively with competitors who are much larger than us. However, these transactions may prove not to be successful and may divert our resources or the attention of our management from other opportunities. Negotiating and implementing these arrangements can be time consuming and cause delays in the introduction of joint product and service offerings and disruptions to VMware\u2019s business. We cannot predict whether our stockholders and industry or securities analysts who cover us will react positively to announcements of new related persons transactions with Dell, and such\nannouncements could have a negative impact on our stock price. Our participation in these transactions may also cause certain of our other vendors and ecosystem partners who compete with Dell and its subsidiaries to also view us as their competitors.\nOur business and Dell\u2019s businesses overlap, and Dell may compete with us, which could reduce our market share.\nWe and Dell are IT infrastructure companies providing products and services that overlap in various areas, including software-based storage, management, hyperconverged infrastructure and cloud computing. Dell competes with us in these areas now and may engage in increased competition with us in the future. In addition, the intellectual property agreement that we have entered into with EMC (which is controlled by Dell) provides EMC the ability to use our source code and intellectual property, which, subject to limitations, it may use to produce certain products that compete with ours. EMC\u2019s rights in this regard extend to its majority-owned subsidiaries, which could include joint ventures where EMC holds a majority position and one or more of our competitors hold minority positions.\nDell could assert control over us in a manner that could impede our growth or our ability to enter new markets or otherwise adversely affect our business. Further, Dell could utilize its control over us to cause us to take or refrain from taking certain actions, including entering into relationships with channel, technology and other marketing partners, enforcing our intellectual property rights or pursuing business combinations, other corporate opportunities (which EMC is expressly permitted to pursue under the circumstances set forth in our certificate of incorporation) or product development initiatives that could adversely affect our competitive position, including our competitive position relative to that of Dell in markets where we compete with Dell. In addition, Dell maintains significant partnerships with certain of our competitors, including Microsoft.\nDell\u2019s competition in certain markets may affect our ability to build and maintain partnerships.\nOur existing and potential partner relationships may be negatively affected by our relationship with Dell. We partner with a number of companies that compete with Dell in certain markets in which Dell participates. Dell\u2019s control of EMC\u2019s majority ownership in us may affect our ability to effectively partner with these companies. These companies may favor our competitors because of our relationship with Dell.\nDell competes with certain of our significant channel, technology and other marketing partners, including IBM and Hewlett-Packard. Pursuant to our certificate of incorporation and other agreements that we have with EMC, EMC and Dell may have the ability to impact our relationship with those of our partners that compete with EMC or Dell, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our ability to pursue opportunities which may otherwise be available to us.\nWe could be held liable for the tax liabilities of other members of Dell\u2019s consolidated tax group, and compared to our historical results as a member of the EMC consolidated tax group, our tax liabilities may increase, fluctuate more widely and be less predictable.\nWe have historically been included in EMC\u2019s consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as well as in certain consolidated, combined or unitary groups that include EMC or certain of its subsidiaries for state and local income tax purposes, and since the Dell Acquisition, we have been included in Dell\u2019s consolidated tax group. Effective as of the close of the Dell Acquisition, we amended our tax sharing agreement with EMC to include Dell. Although our tax sharing agreement provides that our tax liability is calculated primarily as though VMware were a separate taxpayer, certain tax attributes and transactions are assessed using consolidated tax return rules as applied to the Dell consolidated tax group and are subject to other specialized terms under the tax sharing agreement. Pursuant to our agreement, we and Dell generally will make payments to each other such that, with respect to tax returns for any taxable period in which we or any of our subsidiaries are included in Dell\u2019s consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes or any other consolidated, combined or unitary group of Dell or its subsidiaries, the amount of taxes to be paid by us will be determined, subject to certain consolidated return adjustments, as if we and each of our subsidiaries included in such consolidated, combined or unitary group filed our own consolidated, combined or unitary tax return. Consequently, compared to our historical results as a member of the EMC consolidated tax group, the amount of our tax sharing payment compared to our separate return basis liability may increase, vary more widely from period to period and be less predictable. Additionally, the impact of the 2017 Tax Act upon consolidated groups is highly complex and uncertain and its impact must be further interpreted in the context of the tax sharing agreement to determine VMware\u2019s tax sharing payment. In April 2019, VMware, Dell and EMC entered into a letter agreement that governs our portion of the one-time transition tax imposed by the 2017 Tax Act on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.\nWhen we become subject to federal income tax audits as a member of Dell\u2019s consolidated group, the tax sharing agreement provides that Dell has authority to control the audit and represent Dell and our interests to the IRS. Accordingly, if we and Dell or its successor-in-interest differ on appropriate responses and positions to take with respect to tax questions that may arise in the course of an audit, our ability to affect the outcome of such audits may be impaired. In addition, if Dell effects a 355 Distribution or other transaction that is subsequently determined to be taxable, we could be liable for all or a portion of the tax liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have been included in the EMC consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes since our acquisition by EMC in 2004, and will continue to be included in Dell\u2019s consolidated group for periods in which Dell or its successor-in-interest\nbeneficially owns at least 80% of the total voting power and value of our outstanding stock. Each member of a consolidated group during any part of a consolidated return year is jointly and severally liable for tax on the consolidated return of such year and for any subsequently determined deficiency thereon. Similarly, in some jurisdictions, each member of a consolidated, combined or unitary group for state, local or foreign income tax purposes is jointly and severally liable for the state, local or foreign income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated, combined or unitary group. Accordingly, for any period in which we are included in the Dell consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes or any other consolidated, combined or unitary group of Dell and its subsidiaries, we could be liable in the event that any income tax liability was incurred, but not discharged, by any other member of any such group.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we completed the acquisition of Pivotal. Pivotal will continue to file its separate tax return for U.S. federal income tax purposes as it left the Dell consolidated tax group at the time of Pivotal\u2019s initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) in April 2018. Pursuant to a tax sharing agreement, Pivotal historically received payments from Dell for the tax benefits derived from the inclusion of its losses in certain Dell U.S. federal and state group returns. This has reduced the amount of benefit or expense received by Pivotal since the IPO to the amount of benefit or expenses Dell realizes from Pivotal\u2019s inclusion on unitary state tax returns.\nOn December 30, 2019, VMware entered into a second tax sharing agreement with Dell in connection with, and effective as of, the Pivotal acquisition. The tax sharing agreement with Dell, subject to certain exceptions, generally limits VMware\u2019s maximum annual tax liability to Dell to the amount VMware would owe on a separate tax return basis.\nAlso, under the tax sharing agreement, if it is subsequently determined that the tracking stock issued in connection with the Dell Acquisition and which Dell subsequently eliminated through a share exchange constitutes a taxable distribution, we could be liable for all or a portion of the tax liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have limited ability to resolve favorably any disputes that arise between us and Dell.\nDisputes may arise between Dell and us in a number of areas relating to our ongoing relationships, including our reseller, technology and other business agreements with Dell, areas of competitive overlap, strategic initiatives, requests for consent to activities specified in our certificate of incorporation and the terms of our intercompany agreements. We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts with Dell, and even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party.\nWhile we are controlled by Dell, we may not have the leverage to negotiate renewals or amendments to these agreements, if required, on terms as favorable to us as those we would negotiate with an unaffiliated third party, if at all.\nSome of our directors have potential conflicts of interest with Dell.\nThe Chairman of our Board of Directors, Michael Dell, is also Chairman and CEO of Dell and is a significant stockholder of Dell, and one of our directors, Egon Durbin, is member of the Dell board of directors and managing partner of Silver Lake Partners, which is a significant stockholder of Dell. Another of our directors also holds shares of Dell common stock. Dell, through its controlling voting interest in our outstanding common stock, is entitled to elect 8 of our 9 directors and possesses sufficient voting control to elect the remaining director. Ownership of Dell common stock by our directors and the presence of executive officers or directors of Dell on our board of directors could create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving both us and Dell that could have different implications for Dell than they do for us. Our Board has approved resolutions that address corporate opportunities that are presented to our directors that are also directors or officers of Dell. These provisions may not adequately address potential conflicts of interest or ensure that potential conflicts of interest will be resolved in our favor. As a result, we may not be able to take advantage of corporate opportunities presented to individuals who are directors of both us and Dell and we may be precluded from pursuing certain growth initiatives.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules and, as a result, are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not \u201ccontrolled companies.\u201d\nDell owns more than 50% of the total voting power of our common stock and, as a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the NYSE corporate governance standards. As a controlled company, we are exempt under the NYSE standards from the obligation to comply with certain NYSE corporate governance requirements, including the requirements:\n\u2022\nthat a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthat we have a corporate governance and nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities;\n\u2022\nthat we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022\nfor an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and governance committee and compensation committee.\nWhile we have voluntarily caused our Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee to currently be composed entirely of independent directors, reflecting the requirements of the NYSE, we are not required to maintain the independent composition of the committee. As a result of our use of the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemptions, holders of our Class A common stock will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.\nDell\u2019s ability to control our board of directors may make it difficult for us to recruit independent directors.\nSo long as Dell beneficially owns shares of our common stock representing at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of outstanding voting stock, Dell can effectively control and direct our board of directors. Further, the interests of Dell and our other stockholders may diverge. Under these circumstances, it may become difficult for us to recruit independent directors.\nOur historical financial information as a majority-owned subsidiary may not be representative of the results of a completely independent public company.\nThe financial information covering the periods included in this report does not necessarily reflect what our financial condition, operating results or cash flows would have been had we been a completely independent entity during those periods. In certain geographic regions where we do not have an established legal entity, we contract with Dell subsidiaries for support services and Dell personnel who are managed by us. The costs incurred by Dell on our behalf related to these employees are passed on to us and we are charged a mark-up intended to approximate costs that would have been charged had we contracted for such services with an unrelated third party. These costs are included as expenses on our consolidated statements of income. Additionally, we engage with Dell in related party transactions, including agreements regarding the use of Dell\u2019s and our intellectual property and real estate, agreements regarding the sale of goods and services to one another, and agreements for Dell to resell and distribute our products and services to third party customers. If Dell were to distribute its shares of our common stock to its stockholders or otherwise divest itself of all or a significant portion of its VMware shares, there would be numerous implications to us, including the fact that we could lose the benefit of these arrangements with Dell. There can be no assurance that we would be able to renegotiate these arrangements with Dell or replace them on the same or similar terms. Additionally, our business could face significant disruption and uncertainty as we transition from these arrangements with Dell. Moreover, our historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of what our financial condition, operating results or cash flows would be in the future if and when we contract at arm\u2019s length with independent third parties for the services we have received and currently receive from Dell. During the year ended January 31, 2020, we recognized revenue of $3.4 billion, and as of January 31, 2020, $3.8 billion of sales were included in unearned revenue from such transactions with Dell. For additional information, refer to \u201cOur Relationship with Dell\u201d in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 and Note D to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Class A Common Stock\nThe price of our Class A common stock has fluctuated significantly in recent years and may fluctuate significantly in the future.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and could fluctuate substantially in the future due to the factors discussed in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this report.\nDell, which beneficially owned 80.9% of our outstanding stock as of January 31, 2020, is not restricted from selling its shares and is entitled to certain registration rights. If a significant number of shares enters the public trading markets in a short period of time, the market price of our Class A common stock may decline. In addition, if our Class B common stock is distributed to Dell stockholders and remains outstanding, it would trade separately from and potentially at a premium to our Class A common stock, and could thereby contribute additional volatility to the price of our Class A common stock.\nBroad market and industry factors may also decrease the market price of our Class A common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The stock market in general and technology companies in particular have often experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Our public float is also relatively small due to Dell\u2019s holdings, which can result in greater volatility in our stock compared to that of other companies with a market capitalization similar to ours. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted, including against us, and, if not resolved swiftly, can result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIf securities or industry analysts change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in Delaware law and our charter documents could discourage takeover attempts.\nAs our controlling stockholder, Dell has the ability to prevent a change in control of VMware. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nthe division of our board of directors into three classes, with each class serving for a staggered three-year term, which prevents stockholders from electing an entirely new board of directors at any annual meeting;\n\u2022\nthe right of the board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors;\n\u2022\nfollowing a 355 Distribution of Class B common stock by Dell to its stockholders, the restriction that a beneficial owner of 10% or more of our Class B common stock may not vote in any election of directors unless such person or group also owns at least an equivalent percentage of Class A common stock or obtains approval of our board of directors prior to acquiring beneficial ownership of at least 5% of Class B common stock;\n\u2022\nthe prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors or any other matters, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe requirement for advance notice for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock with terms set by the board of directors, which rights could be senior to those of common stock; and\n\u2022\nin the event that Dell or its successor-in-interest no longer owns shares of our common stock representing at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors, stockholders may not act by written consent and may not call special meetings of the stockholders.\nIn addition, we have elected to apply the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us. These provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts and could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 92257, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "VMW"}
