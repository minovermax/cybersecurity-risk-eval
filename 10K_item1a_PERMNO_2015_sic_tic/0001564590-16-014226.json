{"cik": "1016169", "company": "ANTARES PHARMA, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe following \u201crisk factors\u201d contain important information about us and our business and should be read in their entirety. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we now believe to be not material could also impair our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer significantly. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all of your investment. In this Section, the terms the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d and \u201cus\u201d refer to Antares Pharma, Inc.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe have incurred significant losses to date, and there is no guarantee that we will ever become profitable.\nWe incurred net losses of $20,658,846 and $35,151,715 in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, we had an accumulated deficit at December 31, 2015 of $229,106,502. The costs for research and development of our products, product candidates and drug delivery technologies, and certain product candidates of our partners, along with marketing and selling expenses and general and administrative expenses, have been the principal causes of our losses. We may not ever become profitable and if we do not become profitable your investment could be harmed.\nWe may need additional capital in the future in order to continue our operations.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had cash and investments of $47,910,901. The combination of our current cash and investments balance and projected product sales, product development fees, license revenues, milestone payments and royalties should provide us with sufficient funds to support operations for at least the next twelve months. However, if funds are not sufficient to support operations in the future, we may need to raise additional funds through debt or equity financings (such as issuing additional equity or debt, including notes convertible into our common stock) or reduce expenditures to meet our cash requirements. If we do obtain such financing, we cannot assure that the amount or the terms of such financing will be as attractive as we may desire, and your equity interest in the company may be diluted. For example, on May 11, 2015, we completed an underwritten offering of 23,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $2.00 per share in a public offering. On May 5, 2015, the day we launched the offering, the closing price per share of our common stock was $2.30. If we are unable to obtain financing when needed, or if the amount of such financing is not sufficient, it may be necessary for us to take significant cost saving measures or generate funding in ways that may negatively affect our business in the future. To reduce expenses, we may be forced to make personnel reductions or curtail or discontinue development programs. To generate funds, it may be necessary to monetize future royalty streams, sell intellectual property, divest of technology platforms or liquidate assets. However, there is no assurance that, if required, we will be able to generate sufficient funds or reduce spending to provide the required liquidity.\nLong-term capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the status of collaborative arrangements, the progress of research and development programs and the receipt of revenues from sales of products. Our ability to achieve and/or sustain profitable operations depends on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully sell OTREXUP\u2122;\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for our own product candidates such as VIBEX\u00ae QS T and VIBEX\u00ae QS M;\n\u00b7\nour and our partners\u2019 ability to obtain regulatory approval, and where applicable to obtain an AB-rating, of partnered products including VIBEX\u00ae epinephrine, exenatide and others;\n\u00b7\nthe success of our partners in launching new products such as VIBEX\u00ae Sumatriptan and selling our existing products;\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully sell future products if we choose not to partner the product;\n\u00b7\nour ability to manufacture, or have manufactured, products efficiently, at the appropriate commercial scale, and with the required quality;\n\u00b7\ntiming of our partners\u2019 development, regulatory and commercialization plans;\n\u00b7\nthe demand for our technologies from current and future pharmaceutical partners;\n\u00b7\nour ability to increase and continue to outsource manufacturing capacity to allow for new product introductions;\n\u00b7\nthe level of product competition and of price competition;\n\u00b7\npatient acceptance of our current and future products;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain reimbursement for our products from third-party payers;\n\u00b7\nour ability to develop additional commercial applications for our products;\n\u00b7\nour ability to attract and retain the right personnel to execute our plans;\n\u00b7\nour ability to develop, maintain or acquire patent positions;\n\u00b7\nour ability to control costs; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions.\nWe launched OTREXUP\u2122 in February 2014 and as a company, we have limited sales and marketing experience.\nWe launched OTREXUP\u2122 in February 2014. Although we have hired highly qualified personnel with specialized expertise, as a company, we have limited experience commercializing pharmaceutical products on our own. In order to commercialize OTREXUP\u2122, we have been building our sales, marketing, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities and have made arrangements with third parties to perform these services when needed. In January 2015, we hired sales representatives and district managers to fill our 32 sales territories. Effective June 23, 2015, we regained the exclusive U.S. marketing rights to OTREXUP\u2122 for the treatment of psoriasis, after the LEO Pharma agreement was terminated for its exclusive right to commercialize OTREXUP\u2122 in the U.S. for this field. We have limited commercial resources and may incur incremental sales and marketing costs if we choose to market OTREXUP\u2122 for the treatment of psoriasis in the U.S. and may be unsuccessful in this commercial strategy. To the extent we rely on third parties to commercialize OTREXUP\u2122 in the future, we may receive less revenues or incur more expenses than if we had commercialized OTREXUP\u2122 ourselves. In addition, we may have limited control over the sales efforts of any third parties involved in our commercialization efforts. If we are unable to successfully implement our commercial plans and drive adoption by patients and physicians of OTREXUP\u2122 through our sales, marketing and commercialization efforts then we may not be able to generate sustainable revenues from product sales which will have a material adverse effect on our business and future product opportunities. Similarly, we may not be successful in maintaining the necessary commercial infrastructure, including sales representatives, managed care, medical affairs and pharmacovigilance teams. The development of commercialization capabilities to market OTREXUP\u2122 has been and will continue to be expensive and time-consuming. As we continue to develop these capabilities, we will have to compete with other pharmaceutical companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel. If we have underestimated the necessary sales and marketing capabilities or have not established the necessary infrastructure to support successful commercialization, or if our efforts to do so take more time and expense than anticipated, our ability to market and sell OTREXUP\u2122 may be adversely affected.\nCommercialization of OTREXUP\u2122 will require significant resources, and if we do not achieve the sales expected, we may lose the substantial investment made in OTREXUP\u2122.\nWe have made and are continuing to make substantial expenditures commercializing OTREXUP\u2122. We have and expect to continue to devote substantial resources to establish and maintain a sales and marketing capability for OTREXUP\u2122. If we are unsuccessful in our commercialization efforts and do not achieve the sales levels of OTREXUP\u2122 that we expect, we may be unable to recover the large investment we have made in research, development, manufacturing, inventory and marketing efforts, and our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe will rely on third parties to perform many necessary services for OTREXUP\u2122, including services related to the distribution, invoicing, storage and transportation of our products.\nWe have retained third-party service providers to perform a variety of functions related to the sale and distribution of our products, key aspects of which are out of our direct control. For example, we rely on Cardinal to provide key services related to logistics, warehousing and inventory management, distribution, contract administration and chargeback processing, accounts receivable management and call center management, and, as a result, most of our finished goods inventory is stored at a single warehouse maintained by the service provider. We place substantial reliance on this provider as well as other third-party providers that perform services for us, including entrusting our inventories of products to their care and handling. If these third-party service providers fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or otherwise do not carry out their contractual duties to us, or encounter physical damage or natural disaster at their facilities, our ability to deliver product to meet commercial demand would be significantly impaired. In addition, we utilize third parties to perform various other services for us relating to sample accountability and regulatory monitoring, including adverse event reporting, safety database management and other product maintenance services. If the quality or accuracy of the data maintained by these service providers is insufficient, our ability to continue to market our products could be jeopardized or we could be subject to regulatory sanctions. We do not currently have the internal capacity to perform these important commercial functions, and we may not be able to maintain commercial arrangements for these services on reasonable terms.\nWe rely on third party data providers to estimate patient prescriptions dispensed for OTREXUP\u2122 and help determine our revenue each reporting period.\nBecause we have limited sales history with OTREXUP\u2122, we rely on third party data providers, such as Symphony Health Solutions, as a basis for estimating the number of patient prescriptions of OTREXUP\u2122 during each reporting period and use this information to calculate revenue for OTREXUP\u2122. While we undertake certain procedures to review the reasonableness of this information, we cannot obtain absolute assurance regarding the accuracy of the prescription or market data or over the accounting methods and controls related to the information provided to us by third parties. If patient prescriptions dispensed for a given period are underestimated or overestimated, adjustments to revenue may be necessary. As a result, we are at risk of third parties providing us with erroneous data which could have a material adverse impact on our revenue reporting and our business.\nWe will depend on Teva to manufacture, supply, distribute and commercialize VIBEX\u00ae Sumatriptan in the U.S.\nWe have entered into a license, supply and distribution agreement with Teva to distribute VIBEX\u00ae Sumatriptan, an auto injector product containing sumatriptan for the treatment of migraines. Under our arrangement, we will manufacture the auto injector and do final assembly and packaging of the final product and Teva will manufacture and supply the drug sumatriptan and distribute and commercialize the product in the U.S. Teva also has an option for rights in other territories.\nThere is no guarantee that our partnership with Teva to distribute VIBEX\u00ae Sumatriptan will be successful. Teva controls the manufacture and supply of the drug, sumatriptan, which is necessary for the production of VIBEX\u00ae Sumatriptan. If, at any time, Teva ceases to manufacture and supply us with sumatriptan or fails to produce sufficient supplies of the drug, we will be unable to produce a finished product or sell our auto injectors designed for this product to Teva. We will also rely on Teva to commercialize and distribute the product within the U.S. and if Teva is unsuccessful in commercializing the product, the resulting revenue may be lower than expected. Additionally, we may disagree with Teva on certain business strategies or its manufacturing and distribution decisions. Such decisions by Teva may be beyond our control and may impact the success of VIBEX\u00ae Sumatriptan and we may receive less revenue than desired or expected. We have invested significant resources in the development of VIBEX\u00ae Sumatriptan, and, if our partnership with Teva is not profitable or is terminated for any reason, we may not receive a return on our investment and may suffer significant losses.\nIf we do not develop and maintain relationships with manufacturers of our and our partners\u2019 drug products or candidates, then we may be unable to successfully manufacture and sell our and our partners\u2019 pharmaceutical products.\nWe do not possess the facilities to manufacture commercial quantities of our drug/device combination product, including OTREXUP\u2122 and VIBEX\u00ae Sumatriptan, or any other of our or our partners\u2019 products or product candidates. We must contract with manufacturers to produce products according to government regulations. The future development and delivery of our product candidates depends on the timely, profitable and competitive performance of these manufacturers. A limited number of manufacturers exist which are capable of manufacturing our and our partners\u2019 product candidates. We and our partners may fail to contract with the necessary manufacturers or we and our partners may contract with manufacturers on terms that may not be favorable to us. Our manufacturers must obtain FDA approval for their manufacturing processes, and we have no control over this approval process. Additionally, use of contract manufacturers exposes us to risks in the manufacturer's business such as their potential inability to perform from a technical, operational or financial standpoint.\nIn addition, contract manufacturers may utilize their own technology, technology developed by us, technology developed by our partners, or technology acquired or licensed from third parties. When contract manufacturers develop proprietary process technology, our reliance on such contract manufacturers is increased. Technology transfer from the original contract manufacturer may be required. Any such technology transfer may also require transfer of requisite data for regulatory purposes, including information contained in a proprietary drug master file held by a contract manufacturer. FDA approval of the new manufacturer and manufacturing site would also be required.\nWe have entered into multiple commercial supply agreements with third-party manufacturers, including, without limitation:\n\u00b7\nthe supply of the methotrexate drug substance;\n\u00b7\nthe manufacture of prefillable syringes;\n\u00b7\nthe manufacture of device components;\n\u00b7\nthe production of the methotrexate drug substance in pre-filled syringes;\n\u00b7\nthe manufacture and partial assembly of VIBEX\u00ae auto injectors; and\n\u00b7\nthe final assembly and packaging of our products and product candidates and our partners\u2019 products and product candidates.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured products ourselves, including:\n\u00b7\nreliance on the third party for regulatory compliance, quality assurance and adequate training in management of manufacturing staff;\n\u00b7\nthe possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control;\n\u00b7\nfailure to supply adequate quantities of product or failure to supply product meeting the required product specification or other manufacturing requirements; and\n\u00b7\nthe possibility of termination or non-renewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nWe depend on these third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMPs enforced by the FDA and other regulatory requirements and to deliver materials on a timely basis. In addition, because regulatory approval to manufacture a drug is generally site-specific, the FDA and other regulatory authorities will repeatedly inspect our current and future third-party manufacturers\u2019 facilities for compliance with cGMPs. If we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may issue warning letters or suspend or withdraw our regulatory approval for approved or in-market products, among other things. Our third-party manufacturers may also fail to pass the audits by our internal quality and regulatory group. Any of these actions could delay our development of products, delay the submission of these products for regulatory approval or result in insufficient product quantity to support commercial demand. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. See additional risk factors associated with manufacturing in the section \u201cRisks Related to Regulatory Matters.\u201d\nIn addition, we may consider entering into additional manufacturing arrangements with third party manufacturers. In each case, we will incur significant costs in obtaining the regulatory approvals and taking the other steps necessary to begin commercial production by these manufacturers.\nWe are dependent on numerous third parties in our supply chain for the commercial supply of our products and partners\u2019 products most of which are currently single source suppliers, and if any of these single-source suppliers are not able to satisfy demand and alternative sources are not available, the manufacturing and distribution of our products and our partners\u2019 products could be delayed and our business could be harmed.\nThe availability of our products for commercial sale depends upon our ability to procure the components, raw materials, packaging materials and finished products we need from third parties. We have entered into supply agreements with numerous third party suppliers, many of which are currently our single source for the materials necessary for certain of our products. For example, we currently have the following single source suppliers in our supply chain for the commercial supply of OTREXUP\u2122:\n\u00b7\nSupplier of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (\u201cAPI\u201d) for methotrexate;\n\u00b7\nPharmascience for supply of commercial quantities of methotrexate pre-filled syringes;\n\u00b7\nNypro for the supply of commercial quantities of the VIBEX\u00ae auto injectors;\n\u00b7\nSharp for assembly and packaging of OTREXUP\u2122;\n\u00b7\nCardinal for services related to logistics, warehousing and inventory management, distribution, contract administration and chargeback processing, accounts receivable management and call center management.\nOur supplier for the pre-filled syringes of methotrexate and our supplier of methotrexate API are single source suppliers to us. If any of these manufacturers is unable to supply its respective component for any reason, including due to violations of the FDA\u2019s QSR requirements, our ability to manufacture the finished OTREXUP\u2122 product will be adversely affected and our ability to meet the distribution requirements for any product sales of OTREXUP\u2122 and the resulting revenue therefrom will be negatively affected. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any failure in any part of our supply chain will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from OTREXUP\u2122 or our other products which depend on third party suppliers, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTo mitigate some of the short-term risk of relying on single source suppliers, we intend to build a safety stock of component and finished goods inventories. However, there can be no assurance that these inventories will be adequate or that we will be able to maintain our desired level of safety stock. Additionally, maintaining a high level of safety stock exposes us to additional risks such as excess and obsolete inventory if the sales volume of OTREXUP\u2122 or our other products do not meet our forecasts.\nIf we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate levels of coverage and reimbursement for OTREXUP\u2122, or any of our other product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval, their commercial success may be severely hindered.\nSuccessful sales of our products depend on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Patients who are prescribed medicine for the treatment of their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Assuming coverage is approved, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products.\nIn addition, the market for our products will depend significantly on access to third-party payors' drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available.\nOur partnered products encounter similar issues in obtaining reimbursement from third-party payors. While we are unable to control the reimbursement rate or discounts contracted with third-party payors by our partners, these rates ultimately affect our royalty payments on products such as Elestrin\u00ae and Gelnique\u00ae.\nThird-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor.\nFurther, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement will likely be subject to increased restrictions both in the U.S. and in international markets. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for OTREXUP\u2122 or any of our other product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval may not be available or adequate in either the U.S. or international markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may incur significant liability if it is determined that we are promoting or have in the past promoted the \u201coff-label\u201d use of drugs or medical devices.\nIn the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions, companies may not promote drugs or medical devices for \u201coff-label\u201d uses, that is, uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and that differ from those that were approved or cleared by the FDA. Under what is known as the \u201cpractice of medicine,\u201d physicians and other healthcare practitioners may prescribe drug products and use medical devices for off-label or unapproved uses, and such uses are common across some medical specialties. Although the FDA does not regulate a physician\u2019s choice of medications, treatments or product uses, the FD&C Act and FDA regulations significantly restrict permissible communications on the subject of off-label uses of drug products and medical devices by pharmaceutical and medical device companies. The FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS-OIG\u201d), the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and various state Attorneys General actively enforce laws and regulations that prohibit the promotion of off-label uses. If the FDA determines that a company has improperly promoted a product \u201coff label\u2019, the FDA may issue a warning letter or seek other enforcement action to limit or restrict certain promotional activities or materials or seek to have product withdrawn from the market or seize product. In addition, a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including civil fines, criminal fines and penalties, civil damages and exclusion from federal funded healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid as well as potential liability under the federal False Claims Act and applicable state false claims acts. Conduct giving rise to such liability could also form the basis for private civil litigation by third-party payers or other persons allegedly harmed by such conduct.\nNotwithstanding the regulatory restrictions on off-label promotion, the FDA\u2019s regulations and judicial case law allow companies to engage in some forms of truthful, non-misleading, and non-promotional speech concerning the off-label uses of their products. We have endeavored to establish and implement extensive compliance programs in order to instruct employees on complying with the relevant advertising and promotion legal requirements. Nonetheless, the FDA, HHS-OIG, the DOJ and/or the state Attorneys General, and qui tam relators may take the position that we are not in compliance with such requirements, and, if such non-compliance is proven, we may be subject to significant liability, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties and fines.\nThe failure of any of our third-party licensees to develop, obtain regulatory approvals for, market, distribute and sell our products as planned may result in us not meeting revenue and profit targets.\nWe partner with pharmaceutical companies, such as Teva, to develop, obtain regulatory approvals for, manufacture and sell our products and technologies along with their products. If one or more of these pharmaceutical company partners fail to pursue the development or marketing of our and our partners\u2019 products as planned, our revenues and profits may not reach expectations or may decline. We may not be able to control the timing and other aspects of the development of products because pharmaceutical company partners may have priorities that differ from ours. Therefore, commercialization of products under development may be delayed unexpectedly. The success of the marketing organizations of our pharmaceutical company partners, as well as the level of priority assigned to the marketing of the products by these entities, which may differ from our priorities, will determine the success of the products incorporating our technologies. Competition in this market could also force us to reduce the prices of our technologies below currently planned levels, which could adversely affect our revenues and future profitability.\nWe are currently working with Teva on four products: VIBEX\u00ae with epinephrine, VIBEX\u00ae with sumatriptan, a pen product with exenatide, and an undisclosed pen product. While VIBEX\u00ae with sumatriptan recently received FDA approval, there is no assurance that development of these products will continue or that the other three will receive FDA approval or if FDA approved they will be a significant revenue source for us. Additionally, Teva is attempting to get an \u201cAB\u201d therapeutic equivalence rating for VIBEX\u00ae with epinephrine, which would allow for substitution of their generic for Mylan\u2019s branded product at the pharmacy. If Teva does not attain the AB rating, the revenue potential for VIBEX\u00ae with epinephrine may be more limited than if an \u201cAB\u201d rating is attained.\nWe currently depend on a limited number of customers for the majority of our revenue, and the loss of any one of these customers could substantially reduce our revenue and impact our liquidity.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we derived approximately 39% of our revenue from Teva and 13% from Ferring. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we derived approximately 33% of our revenue from Teva and 18% from Ferring. The revenue from Teva was product sales, royalties and license and development revenue. The revenue from Ferring was primarily product sales and royalties. In addition, we derive a significant portion of our product sales revenue from shipment of OTREXUP\u2122 to our distributors, including McKesson, which accounted for approximately 15% of total revenues in 2015.\nThe loss of any of these significant customers or partners or reduction in our business activities could cause our revenues to decrease significantly and increase our continuing losses from operations. If OTREXUP\u2122 is not successful and we cannot broaden our customer base, we will continue to depend on a few customers for the majority of our revenues. Additionally, if we are unable to negotiate favorable business terms with these customers in the future, our revenues and gross profits may be insufficient to allow us to achieve and/or sustain profitability or continue operations.\nNone of our significant license or collaboration agreements is perpetual in nature. Each has a specified termination date and may be terminated in advance of the termination date or renewal date by either party under different circumstances, for example a breach by us.\nMost of our total revenues are generated from a small number of products.\nWe generate product sales from a limited number of individual products. If we or our partners are unable to continue to market any one or a number of those products, such as OTREXUP\u2122 or our partnered device products, then our total revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. For example, if any of the products were to lose market share as the result of the entry of new competitors, or if the selling prices of any of these products were to decline significantly, there would be a direct negative impact on our reported revenues.\nWe are dependent on third parties to supply all raw materials used in our products and to provide services for certain core aspects of our business. Any interruption or failure by these suppliers, distributors and collaboration partners to meet their obligations pursuant to various agreements with us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe rely on third parties to supply all raw materials used in our products. In addition, we rely on third party suppliers, distributors and collaboration partners to provide services for certain core aspects of our business, including manufacturing, warehousing, distribution, customer service support, medical affairs services, clinical studies, sales and other technical and financial services. All third party suppliers and contractors are subject to FDA requirements. Our business and financial viability are dependent on the continued supply by these third party suppliers, the regulatory compliance of these third parties, and on the strength, validity and terms of our various contracts with these third party manufacturers, distributors and collaboration partners. Any interruption or failure by our suppliers, distributors and collaboration partners to meet their obligations pursuant to various agreements with us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have become more commercially oriented by further developing our own products and less dependent on our pharmaceutical partners, and we may not have sufficient resources to fully execute our plan.\nWe must make choices as to the drugs that we develop on our own. We may not make the correct choice of drug or technologies when combined with a drug, which may not be accepted by the marketplace as we expected or at all. FDA approval processes for the drugs and drugs with devices may be longer in time and/or more costly and/or require more extended clinical evaluation than anticipated. Funds required to bring our own products to market may be more than anticipated or may not be available at all. We have limited experience in bringing such products to market; therefore, we may experience difficulties in execution of development of internal product candidates.\nIf we do not develop and maintain relationships with manufacturers of our device products, then we may be unable to successfully manufacture and sell our device products.\nOur device manufacturing for our needle-free device has involved the assembly of products from machined stainless steel and composite components in limited quantities. Our device manufacturing for our VIBEX\u00ae auto injector for OTREXUP\u2122 has involved high volume production of numerous complex parts as well as assembly of those parts. We expect that our device manufacturing for VIBEX\u00ae with sumatriptan will also involve many complex parts as well as assembly of those parts. Our planned future device business may necessitate changes and additions to our contract manufacturing and assembly process or the use of a secondary manufacturer due to the anticipated larger scale of manufacturing in our business plan. Our devices must be manufactured in compliance with regulatory requirements, in a timely manner and in sufficient quantities while maintaining quality and acceptable manufacturing costs. In the course of these changes and additions to our manufacturing and production methods, we may encounter difficulties, including problems involving scale-up, yields, quality control and assurance, product reliability, manufacturing costs, existing and new equipment and component supplies, any of which could result in significant delays in production.\nMRP manufactures and assembles our needle-free devices and certain related disposable component parts for our partners Ferring and JCR. There can be no assurance that MRP will be able to continue to meet these regulatory requirements or our own quality control standards. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully produce and manufacture our products. Our pharmaceutical partners retain the right to audit the quality systems of our manufacturing partner, and there can be no assurance that MRP will be successful in these audits. Any of these failures would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We will also continue to outsource manufacturing of our future disposable injection products to third parties. Such products will be price sensitive and may be required to be manufactured in large quantities, and we have no assurance that this can be done. Additionally, use of contract manufacturers exposes us to risks in the manufacturers\u2019 business such as their potential inability to perform from a technical, operational or financial standpoint.\nAny failure by Nypro or Phillips, to successfully manufacture the pressure assisted auto injector device in commercial quantities, be in compliance with regulatory regulations, or pass the audits by our internal quality and regulatory group or pharmaceutical partner would have a negative impact on our future revenue expectations.\nWe intend to use ComDel Innovation, Inc. and other third parties to manufacture VIBEX\u00ae with Sumatriptan. We have existing relationships with many of these third parties in the context of our other products but there is no guarantee we will be able to secure favorable terms for the manufacture of this product. If we are unsuccessful in finalizing our arrangements with these third parties or in negotiating favorable contractual terms, the launch of VIBEX\u00ae with Sumatriptan could be delayed.\nWe rely on third parties to supply components for our products, and any failure to retain relationships with these third parties could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products and those of our third-party collaboration partners.\nCertain of our technologies contain a number of customized components manufactured by various third parties. Regulatory requirements applicable to manufacturing can make substitution of suppliers costly and time-consuming. In the event that we could not obtain adequate quantities of these customized components from our suppliers, there can be no assurance that we would be able to access alternative sources of such components within a reasonable period of time, on acceptable terms or at all. The unavailability of adequate quantities, the inability to develop alternative sources, a reduction or interruption in supply or a significant increase in the price of components could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and market our products.\nIf medical doctors do not prescribe our products or our partners\u2019 products, or the medical profession or patients do not accept our products or our partners\u2019 products, our ability to grow or maintain our revenues will be limited.\nOur business is dependent on market acceptance of our products and those of our partners by physicians, healthcare payors, patients and the medical community. Medical doctors\u2019 willingness to prescribe, and patients\u2019 willingness to accept, our products and those of our partners depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nperceived safety and efficacy of our products;\n\u00b7\nconvenience and ease of administration;\n\u00b7\nprevalence and severity of adverse side effects in both clinical trials and commercial use;\n\u00b7\navailability of alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\ncost effectiveness;\n\u00b7\neffectiveness of our marketing strategy and the pricing of our products;\n\u00b7\npublicity concerning our products or competing products; and\n\u00b7\nthird-party coverage or reimbursement for our products and those of our partners.\nEven though we have received regulatory approval for OTREXUP\u2122 and for our transdermal gel products, and even if we receive regulatory approval and satisfy the above criteria for any of our product candidates, physicians may not prescribe, and patients may not accept, our products if we do not promote our products effectively. Factors that could affect our success in marketing our products include:\n\u00b7\nthe adequacy and effectiveness of our sales force and that of any partners or international partner\u2019s sales force;\n\u00b7\nthe adequacy and effectiveness of our production, distribution and marketing capabilities and those of our international partners;\n\u00b7\nthe success of competing treatments or products, including generics; and\n\u00b7\nthe availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payors for our products and those of our partners.\nIf any of our products or product candidates or those of our partners fails to achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to market and sell the products successfully, which would limit our ability to generate revenue and could harm our business.\nThe failure of our licensees to perform under any of our existing licensing agreements or the failure to enter into new licensing agreements could substantially affect our revenue.\nOne of our business strategies to reduce development risk is to enter into license agreements with pharmaceutical companies covering the development, manufacture, use and marketing of our drug delivery devices with specific drug therapies. Under these arrangements, the partners typically assist us in the development of the product and sponsor the collection of the appropriate data for submission for regulatory approval of the use of the drug delivery device with the licensed drug therapy. Our licensees may also be responsible for distribution and marketing of the product or technologies for these therapies either worldwide or in specific territories. We are currently a party to a number of such agreements, all of which are currently in varying stages of development. We may not be able to meet future milestones established in our agreements (such milestones generally being structured around satisfactory completion of certain phases of clinical development, regulatory approvals and commercialization of our product) and thus, would not receive the fees expected from such arrangements, related future royalties or product sales. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in executing additional collaborative agreements or that existing or future agreements will result in increased sales of our drug delivery technologies or products. In such event, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected, and our revenues and gross profits may be insufficient to allow us to achieve and/or sustain profitability. As a result of our collaborative agreements, we are dependent upon the development, data collection and marketing efforts of our licensees. The amount and timing of resources such licensees devote to these efforts are not within our control, and such licensees could make material decisions regarding these efforts that could adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations. In addition, factors that adversely impact the introduction and level of sales of any drug or drug device covered by such licensing arrangements, including competition within the pharmaceutical and medical device industries, the timing of regulatory or other approvals and intellectual property litigation, may also negatively affect sales of our drug delivery technology. We are relying on partners such as Teva, Ferring, Actavis, AMAG and Meda for future milestone, sales and royalty revenue. Any or all of these partners may never commercialize a product with our technologies, may be unsuccessful in commercializing a product, or significant delays in anticipated launches of these products may occur. For example, Teva submitted an amendment to the VIBEX\u00ae epinephrine pen ANDA in December 2014 and received a CRL from the FDA in February 2016 in which, according to Teva, the FDA identified\ncertain major deficiencies. Due to the major nature of the CRL, Teva expects that its epinephrine product will be substantially delayed from their previously anticipated launch in the second half of 2016 and that any launch will not take place before 2017. While we assist our partners in obtaining regulatory approvals and advancing new products, we depend on these partners and cannot control their decision-making or progress in achieving such goals. Any potential loss of anticipated future revenue could have an adverse effect on our business and the value of your investment.\nTiming and results of clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of products as well as the FDA\u2019s approval of products are uncertain.\nDrug development is an inherently risky and uncertain process. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the sale of any new product candidates, we and our partners must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that the product is safe and effective for each intended use. Preclinical and clinical studies may fail to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a product. Likewise, we and our partners may not be able to demonstrate through clinical trials that a product candidate\u2019s therapeutic benefits outweigh its risks. Even promising results from preclinical and early clinical studies do not always accurately predict results in later, large scale trials. A failure to demonstrate safety and efficacy could or would result in the failure to obtain regulatory approvals.\nThe rate of patient enrollment sometimes delays completion of clinical studies. There is substantial competition to enroll patients in clinical trials and such competition has delayed clinical development of our products in the past. For example, patients may not enroll in clinical trials at the rate expected or patients may drop out after enrolling in the trials or during the trials. Delays in planned patient enrollment can result in increased development costs and delays in regulatory approval. In addition, we rely on collaboration partners that may control or make changes in trial protocol and design enhancements, or encounter clinical trial compliance-related issues, which may also delay clinical trials. Product supplies may be delayed or be insufficient to treat the patients participating in the clinical trials, or manufacturers or suppliers may not meet the requirements of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, such as those relating to cGMP. We and our partners also may experience delays in obtaining, or we and our partners may not obtain, required initial and continuing approval of our clinical trials from institutional review boards. We cannot assure you that we will not experience delays or undesired results in these or any other clinical trials.\nFor example, we are currently conducting clinical studies of VIBEX\u00ae QS T for testosterone replacement therapy. In October 2015, we announced that the last patient in study QST-13-003 received their week 52 treatment, marking the end of treatment and the follow up phase of this study. In early November 2015, we announced that we had completed enrollment in our supplemental safety study QST-15-005. Upon successful completion of QST-15-005, we believe we should be able to satisfy the FDA\u2019s previous recommendation that we create a larger safety base of subjects exposed to QS T. However, there is no guarantee that completion of study QST-15-005 will meet the FDA\u2019s recommendations and we may need to conduct further clinical studies with additional subjects and data in the future. In addition, we may experience delays or incur additional, unexpected costs in our completion of these clinical trials which may delay or otherwise adversely impact regulatory approval of VIBEX\u00ae QS T.\nWe cannot assure you that the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies will approve, clear for marketing or certify any products developed by us or our partners, on a timely basis, if at all, or, if granted, that such approval will not subject the marketing of our products to certain limits on indicated use. The FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may not agree with the assessment by us or our clinical partners of the clinical data or they may interpret it differently. Such regulatory authorities may require additional or expanded clinical trials. Any limitation on use imposed by the FDA or delay in or failure to obtain FDA approvals or clearances of products developed by us and our partners would adversely affect the marketing of these products and our ability to generate product revenue, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approvals for certain generic products, we and our partners must conduct limited clinical or other trials to show comparability to the branded products. A failure to obtain satisfactory results in these trials would prevent us from obtaining required regulatory approvals.\nIf we are not able to establish new collaborations, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nThe development and potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. For some of our product candidates, we may decide to partner with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of those product candidates.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaboration partners. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the partner\u2019s resources and experience, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed partner\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge\nto such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. The partner may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available for collaboration and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. We may also be restricted under future license agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with potential partners. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future partners.\nWe may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenues.\nWe face intense competition and if we cannot develop and market our products as rapidly or cost-effectively as our competitors, we may never be able to achieve profitable operations.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive, and we face competition across the full range of our activities. Competitive factors include product quality and price, reputation, service, product safety, development and efficacy and access to scientific and technical information. If we fail to compete successfully in any of these areas, our business could be adversely affected and we may never be able to achieve profitable operations. It is possible that developments from our competitors will make our products or technologies uncompetitive or obsolete.\nFor example, competitors in the methotrexate, the treatment of migraines, injector device and other markets, some with greater resources and experience than us, may enter these markets, as there is an increasing recognition of a need for branded 505(b)(2) products. Our success depends, in part, upon maintaining a competitive position in the development of products and technologies in rapidly evolving fields. If we cannot maintain competitive products and technologies, our current and potential pharmaceutical company partners may choose to adopt the technologies of our competitors. Companies that compete with our injector-based technologies include Ypsomed, Owen Mumford, Elcam, SHL, Bioject Medical Technologies, Inc., Haselmeier, Bespak-Consort Medical, West Pharmaceuticals and Becton Dickinson, along with other companies. We also compete generally with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies engaged in the development of alternative drug delivery technologies or new drug research and testing.\nThe rheumatoid arthritis market, which is the main focus of our efforts for OTREXUP\u2122, is intensely competitive. We face competition from several branded and generic products, many from larger companies that have more experience and greater resources than does our Company. In October 2014, Medac launched Rasuvo\u2122, a product that competes directly with OTREXUP\u2122 and could reduce the market penetration of OTREXUP\u2122.\nIn addition, we face competition with respect to OTREXUP\u2122 from major pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Potential competitors also include academic institutions and other public and private research institutions that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. Our competitors may develop products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient or are less costly than OTREXUP\u2122.\nThe Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act permits the FDA to approve biosimilar versions of biological products like Humira\u00ae, Enbrel\u00ae, Simponi\u00ae, Cimzia\u00ae, Orencia\u00ae, Actemra\u00ae, Rituxan\u00ae and Remicaid\u00ae through an abbreviated approval pathway. This regulatory pathway could result in earlier entry of lower-cost biosimilars which could lower our value proposition of OTREXUP\u2122 relative to that of costlier branded biologics. The approval of lower-cost biosimilar products could decrease the revenue we receive for OTREXUP\u2122.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing and distributing approved products than we do. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in acquiring products, product candidates and technologies complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business.\nAlthough not currently approved for subcutaneous administration, we may face competition from generic versions of injectable methotrexate offered at substantially lower cost. Manufacturers may seek approval to market low cost generic products without the cost and benefit of an auto injector which could appeal to third-party payers and reduce the market penetration of OTREXUP\u2122.\nThere also are numerous competitive products on the market to treat migraines. There are currently seven triptans marketed in the U.S. indicated for treatment of migraine. Five are available as generics and two retain patent exclusivity. According to Catamaran, patent protection for Eletriptan (Relpax, Pfizer) will expire in December 2016, while patent protection for Almotriptan (Axert, Janssen) ends in June 2017.\nHealthcare professionals frequently prescribe triptans to stop migraine attacks , such as GSK\u2019s Imitrex (sumatriptan) and Amerge (naratriptan); Pfizer\u2019s Relpax (eletriptan), Merck & Co., Inc.\u2019s (\u201cMerck\u201d) Maxalt (rizatriptan), Impax Laboratories\u2019 Zomig (zolmitriptan), Janssen Pharmaceuticals\u2019 Axert (almotriptan), and Endo Pharmaceuticals\u2019 Frova (frovatriptan) to relieve acute symptoms of a migraine attack (Medco claims database study).\nSumatriptan is currently available in an oral formation, a nasal spray (Imitrex, GSK and generic), a needle free injector (Sumavel, Astellas/Zogenix), and a transdermal patch (Zecuity, Teva). Several manufacturers offer versions of injectable sumatriptan with a delivery device, including GSK (Imitrex StatDose), Pfizer (Alsuma) Zogenix, Inc. (Sumavel DosePro), and Sun Pharma (generic sumatriptan autoinjector) and recently Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories (Zembrace SymTouch). Two companies, Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc. and Sandoz, market authorized generic versions of GSK\u2019s Imitrex STATdose. At least three companies, including Bedford Labs, Teva, and Fresenius Kabi have FDA approval to market injection sumatriptan in prefilled syringes, although we are not aware of any that presently market this product configuration. Additionally, several generics manufacturers offer injectable sumatriptan in vials.\nContinued consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry, and particularly in the generic pharmaceutical industry, could impact our existing partnerships, products and product candidates\nThere are a limited number of companies with sufficient scale and commercial reach to effectively market many of our products. Recent trends in the pharmaceutical industry suggest additional market consolidation, further concentrating financial, technical and market strength and resources and increasing competitive pressure in the industry. For example, Teva is currently in the process of acquiring the generic business of Allergan (formerly Actavis). Since we are presently working with Teva on four products, VIBEX\u00ae with epinephrine, VIBEX\u00ae with Sumatriptan, a pen product with exenatide, and an undisclosed pen product, if this transaction is consummated, it is possible that the Federal Trade Commission could require that Teva divest certain of our products as part of the transaction. The acquiring party of the product following such a divestiture may have less market power than Teva, resulting in a loss of market share and reduced pricing. Additionally, acquisitions and integrations are time and resource intensive and Teva\u2019s attention and resources could be diverted to other acquisition or integration related activities or opportunities which could potentially delay or negatively impact the success of some of our products with Teva. For other products, increased consolidation could lead to more intense competition and pricing pressure which could have a result in a substantial decrease in our revenues and harm our operating results. Consolidation may also lead to changes in personnel at our partners, potentially impacting the composition of our relationship teams at these partners and leading to material delays in the development and marketing of our products.\nAlthough we have applied for, and/or have received, several patents and trademarks, we may be unable to protect our intellectual property, which would negatively affect our ability to compete.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and enforce patents for our products and device technologies and to preserve our trade secrets and other proprietary information. If we cannot do so, our competitors may exploit our innovations and deprive us of the ability to realize revenues and profits from our developments.\nWe currently hold numerous patents and have numerous patent applications pending in the U.S. and other countries. Our current patents may not be valid or enforceable and may not protect us against competitors that challenge our patents, obtain their own patents that may have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business, or are able to otherwise circumvent our patents. Additionally, our products and technologies are complex and one patent may not be sufficient to protect our products where a series of patents may be needed. Further, we may not have the necessary financial resources to enforce or defend our patents or patent applications. Even issued patents may later be modified or declared invalid by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office by analogous foreign offices or in legal proceedings. In addition, any patent applications we may have made or may make relating to inventions for our actual or potential products and technologies may not result in patents being issued or may result in patents that provide insufficient or incomplete coverage for our inventions.\nTo protect our trade secrets and proprietary technologies and processes, we rely, in part, on confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and advisors. These agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets and other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure, or if others lawfully and independently develop the same or similar information.\nWe may seek to protect our patent rights by asserting an allegation of infringement against third parties. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming and the outcome is uncertain. There is no assurance of success with any patent litigation. Depending on the ultimate outcome of the litigation it may have an adverse effect on results of operations and our market penetration. For example, based on a Medac press release in January 2014, we became aware that Medac submitted an NDA to the FDA for an auto-pen containing methotrexate. On February 28, 2014, Antares sued Medac and its foreign parent, medac GmbH (together, \u201cMedac\u201d), in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of two of the Company\u2019s patents for technology regarding an auto injector and an auto injector containing methotrexate. In April 2015, Antares, Medac, LEO Pharma, Inc. and LEO Pharm A/S entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which the proceedings related to Antares\u2019 patents, as well as patent claims filed by Medac against Antares, LEO Pharma and LEO Pharma A/S, were dismissed with prejudice (the \u201cMedac Settlement\u201d). The settlement agreement provides for a royalty-free cross-license under the patents named in the proceedings and their families allowing the manufacture and sale of OTREXUP (methotrexate) injection and RASUVO in and for the U.S.\nOthers may bring infringement claims against us, which could be time-consuming and expensive to defend and the outcomes uncertain.\nThird parties may claim that the manufacture, use or sale of our drug delivery technologies infringe their patent rights. As with any litigation where claims may be asserted, we may have to seek licenses, defend infringement actions or challenge the validity of those patents in the patent office or the courts. If these are not resolved favorably, we may not be able to continue to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Even if we were able to obtain rights to a third party\u2019s intellectual property, these rights may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors potential access to the same intellectual property. If we are found liable for infringement or are not able to have these patents declared invalid or unenforceable, we may be liable for significant monetary damages, encounter significant delays in bringing products to market or be precluded from participating in the manufacture, use or sale of products or methods of drug delivery covered by patents of others. Any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. We may not have identified, or be able to identify in the future, U.S. or foreign patents that pose a risk of potential infringement claims. Ultimately, we may be unable to commercialize some of our product candidates as a result of patent infringement claims, which could potentially harm our business.\nFor example, we incurred significant expenses in connection with our patent litigation with Medac. Medac filed a patent infringement suit against Antares, LEO Pharma and, its parent company, LEO Pharma A/S in the United State District Court for the District of New Jersey. On November 18, 2014, Medac and Medac GmbH filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin Antares, LEO Pharma and LEO Pharma A/S from selling OTREXUP in the U.S., pending the final resolution of the litigation. On July 1, 2014, Antares filed a petition with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (the \u201cPTAB\u201d) of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office seeking an inter partes review of Medac\u2019s \u2019231 patent challenging the validity of the\u2019231 patent. On January 6, 2015, the PTAB issued an order instituting an inter partes review of all claims of the \u2019231 patent. Medac\u2019s patent claims as well as Antares\u2019 petition with the PTAB were dismissed in April 2015 pursuant to the Medac Settlement. See Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3 for a further discussion of the litigation.\nIn November 2008, Meridian Medical Technologies (\u201cMeridian\u201d) received U.S. Patent 7,449,012 (the \u2018\u201c012 patent\u201d) relating to a specific type of auto injector for use with epinephrine. On August 28, 2009, King and Meridian had filed suit against Teva in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware asserting its \u2018012 patent. On October 21, 2009, Teva filed its answer asserting non-infringement and invalidity of the \u2018012 patent. On November 3, 2011, Meridian and King requested to dismiss their claims against Teva involving the '012 patent, and the Court entered the dismissal on November 7, 2011, removing the '012 patent from the litigation.\nIn September 2010, King received U.S. Patent No. 7,794,432 (the \u201c\u2018432 patent\u201d) relating to certain features of an auto injector for use with epinephrine. King and Meridian filed an amended complaint, in the same litigation as the \u2018012 patent, adding the \u2018432 patent. Trial was held in February and March, 2012, and on April 26, 2012 the Company announced that Meridian Medical Technologies, a Pfizer subsidiary, entered into a settlement agreement with Teva that would resolve pending patent litigation related to its abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for a generic epinephrine auto injector. According to the terms of the settlement, Teva may launch a generic epinephrine auto injector covered by its ANDA on June 22, 2015 or earlier under certain circumstances, subject to receipt of approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\nUnder a separate agreement, Teva has agreed to provide the Company with device orders of an undisclosed amount in the years 2013 and 2014, to make a milestone payment to the Company upon FDA approval of epinephrine auto injector, and to assume all litigation costs related to the patent litigation between Teva and Meridian Medical. Although the litigation has been settled, there can be no assurance that the epinephrine auto injector product will be approved by the FDA or that we will receive a milestone payment or royalties in the future under our agreement with Teva.\nAdditionally, we are developing other products for Teva under the ANDA pathway and we may in the future pursue the development of other products under the ANDA pathway and there can be no assurance that those products do not follow the same type of litigation process of the epinephrine case which could delay or prohibit the launch of those potential products. These product\ncandidates are generic versions of pre-existing brand name drugs and we may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that our partners\u2019 products and/or product candidates and/or proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights, including litigation resulting from filing under Paragraph IV of the Hatch-Waxman Act. These lawsuits could claim that there are existing patent rights for such drug and this type of litigation can be costly and could adversely affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel. There is a risk that a court would decide that we or our commercialization partners are infringing the third party\u2019s patents and would order us or our partners to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us or our partners to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party\u2019s patents.\nProduct liability and product recalls could harm our business.\nThe development, manufacture, testing, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products and medical devices are associated with significant risks of product liability claims or recalls. Side effects or adverse events known or reported to be associated with, or manufacturing defects in, the products sold by us could exacerbate a patient\u2019s condition, or could result in serious injury or impairments or even death. This could result in product liability claims and/or recalls of one or more of our products.\nProduct liability claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief for themselves, or by groups seeking to represent a class of injured patients. Further, third party payors, either individually or as a putative class, may bring actions seeking to recover monies spent on one of our products. While we have not had to defend against any product liability claims to date, as sales of our products increase, we may have product liability claims made against us. The risk of product liability claims may also increase if a company receives a warning letter from a regulatory agency. We cannot predict the frequency, outcome or cost to defend any such claims.\nProduct liability insurance coverage is expensive, can be difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. Our product liability insurance may not cover all of the future liabilities we might incur in connection with the development, manufacture or sale of our products. In addition, we may not continue to be able to obtain insurance on satisfactory terms or in adequate amounts.\nA successful claim or claims brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage could subject us to significant liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Such claims could also harm our reputation and the reputation of our products, adversely affecting our ability to market our products successfully. In addition, defending a product liability lawsuit is expensive and can divert the attention of key employees from operating our business.\nProduct recalls may be issued at our discretion or at the discretion of our suppliers, government agencies and other entities that have regulatory authority for pharmaceutical and medical device sales. Any recall of our products could materially adversely affect our business by rendering us unable to sell that product for some time and by adversely affecting our reputation. A recall could also result in product liability claims by individuals and third party payors. In addition, product liability claims could result in an investigation of the safety or efficacy of our products, our manufacturing processes and facilities, or our marketing programs conducted by the FDA, [the European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d)] or the competent authorities of the EU member states. Such investigations could also potentially lead to a recall of our products or more serious enforcement actions, limitations on the indications for which they may be used, or suspension, variation, or withdrawal of approval. Any such regulatory action by the FDA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the EU member states could lead to product liability lawsuits as well.\nIf we do not have adequate insurance for product liability or clinical trial claims, then we may be subject to significant expenses relating to these claims.\nOur business entails the risk of product liability and clinical trial claims. Although we have not experienced any material claims to date, any such claims could have a material adverse impact on our business. Insurance coverage is expensive and may be difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. We maintain product and clinical trial liability insurance and evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis. If we are subject to a product liability claim, our product liability insurance may not reimburse us, or may not be sufficient to reimburse us, for any expenses or losses that may have been suffered. A successful product liability claim against us, if not covered by, or if in excess of our product liability insurance, may require us to make significant compensation payments, which would be reflected as expenses on our statement of operations. Adverse claim experience for our products or licensed technologies or medical device, pharmaceutical or insurance industry trends may make it difficult for us to obtain product liability insurance or we may be forced to pay very high premiums, and there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Additionally, if the coverage limits of the product liability insurance are not adequate, a claim brought against us, whether covered by insurance or not, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to retain our key personnel, and continue to attract additional professional staff, we may be unable to maintain or expand our business.\nBecause of the specialized scientific nature of our business, our ability to develop products and to compete with our current and future competitors will remain highly dependent, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and commercial personnel. The loss of key scientific, technical and commercial personnel or the failure to recruit additional key scientific, technical and commercial personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we have employment agreements with our key executives, we cannot assure you that we will succeed in retaining personnel or their services under existing agreements. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of failures in our internal computer systems.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future partners, contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, attacks by computer hackers, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our manufacturing activities, development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of manufacturing records or clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability or damage to our reputation, and the further commercialization and development of our products and product candidates could be delayed.\nIf we make any acquisitions, we will incur a variety of costs and might never successfully integrate the acquired product or business into ours.\nWe might attempt to acquire products or businesses that we believe are a strategic complement to our business model. We might encounter operating difficulties and expenditures relating to integrating an acquired product or business. These acquisitions might require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business. In addition, we might never realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition. We might also make dilutive issuances of equity securities, incur debt or experience a decrease in cash available for our operations, or incur contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses relating to goodwill and other intangible assets, in connection with future acquisitions.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nWe, or our licensees, may incur significant time and costs seeking approval for our products, which could delay the realization of revenue and, ultimately, decrease our revenues from such products.\nThe design, development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical compounds and medical devices are subject to regulation by governmental authorities, including the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries. The approval process is generally lengthy, expensive and subject to unanticipated delays. Currently we, along with our partners, are actively pursuing marketing approval for a number of products from regulatory authorities in other countries and anticipate seeking regulatory approval from the FDA for products developed internally and pursuant to our license agreements. In the future we, or our partners, may need to seek approval for newly developed products. Our revenue and profit will depend, in part, on the successful introduction and marketing of some or all of such products by our partners or us.\nApplicants for FDA approval often must submit extensive clinical data and supporting information to the FDA. Varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a drug product. Changes in FDA approval policy during the development period, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted NDA also may cause delays or rejection of an approval. Even if the FDA approves a product, the approval may limit the uses or \u201cindications\u201d for which a product may be marketed, or may require further studies. The FDA also can withdraw product clearances and approvals for failure to comply with regulatory requirements or if unforeseen problems follow initial marketing.\nWe are developing our own combination products such as VIBEX\u00ae QS T (testosterone) and QS M as well as injection devices for use with our partner\u2019s drugs. The regulatory path for approval of such combination products may be subject to review by several centers within the FDA and although precedent and guidance exists for the requirements for such combination products, there is no assurance that the FDA will not change what it requires or how it reviews such submissions. Human clinical testing may be required by the FDA in order to commercialize these products and devices and there can be no assurance that such trials will be successful. Such changes in review processes or the requirement for clinical studies could delay anticipated launch dates or be at a cost which makes launching the product or device cost prohibitive for ourselves or our partners. Such delay or failure to launch these products or devices could adversely affect our revenues and future profitability.\nAdditionally, based on the written recommendations from the FDA related to our clinical development program for QS T, we launched a supplemental safety study QST-15-005 with additional participants in mid-2015, enrolling its first patients in August 2015. We completed enrollment in QST-15-005 in early November 2015. We believe that, upon successful completion, QST-15-005 should satisfy the FDA\u2019s previous recommendation that we create a larger safety base of subjects exposed to QS T. However, the FDA may have additional recommendations or require further trials and the timing, cost and design of any such study could negatively affect our business if we incur significant costs or delays. Products of this nature normally carry with them the need to monitor safety in an on-going manner, called a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy, or REMS. The REMS for testosterone products is well-defined, and a class-labeling letter has been issued to all approved testosterone replacement products that will likely include being part of a clinical outcomes trial intended to explore cardiovascular risks.\nOur business and product development may also be adversely affected by the result and timing of the FDA\u2019s review of Teva\u2019s ANDA for its epinephrine product and exenatide pen product as we cannot market or sell our injector for use with these drug products in the U.S. until they have been approved by the FDA. Teva submitted an amendment to the VIBEX\u00ae epinephrine pen ANDA in December 2014 and received a CRL from the FDA in February 2016 in which, according to Teva, the FDA identified certain major deficiencies. Teva is evaluating the CRL and intends to submit a response. Due to the major nature of the CRL, Teva expects that its epinephrine product will be substantially delayed from their previously anticipated launch date in the second half of 2016 and that any launch will not take place before 2017. Additionally, Teva is attempting to get an \u201cAB\u201d therapeutic equivalence rating for VIBEX\u00ae with epinephrine, which would allow for substitution of their generic for Mylan\u2019s branded product at the pharmacy. If Teva does not attain the AB rating, the revenue potential for VIBEX\u00ae with epinephrine may be more limited than if an \u201cAB\u201d rating is attained. In January 2015, Mylan Specialty, L.P. submitted a Citizen Petition to FDA requesting that FDA not approve Teva\u2019s ANDA for a generic epinephrine auto injector until a rigorous review under the established standards for proposed generic emergency use auto injectors is conducted.\nIn other jurisdictions, we, and the pharmaceutical companies with whom we are developing technologies (both drugs and devices), must obtain required regulatory approvals from regulatory agencies and comply with extensive regulations regarding safety and quality. If approvals to market the products are delayed, if we fail to receive these approvals, or if we lose previously received approvals, our revenues may not materialize or may decline. We may not be able to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. Additionally, clinical data that we generate or obtain from partners from FDA regulatory filings may not be sufficient for regulatory filings in other jurisdictions and we may be required to incur significant costs in obtaining those regulatory approvals.\nThe 505(b)(2) and 505(j) (ANDA) regulatory pathway for many of our potential products is uncertain and could result in unexpected costs and delays of approvals.\nDrug/device combination products indicated for the treatment of systemic or local conditions, respectively, are regulated by the FDA in the U.S. and other similar regulatory agencies in other countries as drug products. Drug/device combination products may not be marketed in the U.S. until they have been demonstrated to be safe and effective. The regulatory approval routes for drug/device combination products include the filing of an NDA for new drugs, new indications of approved drugs or new dosage forms of approved drugs. Alternatively, these dosage forms can obtain marketing approval as a filing under Section 505(b)(2) where there is an acceptable reference product or as a generic product by the filing of an ANDA, providing the new generic product is bioequivalent to and has the same labeling as a comparable approved product. The combination of the drug, its dosage form and label claims and FDA requirement will ultimately determine which regulatory approval route will be required.\nMany of our drug/device combination product candidates may be developed via the 505(b)(2) or the ANDA route. Both the 505(b)(2) and ANDA regulatory pathways are continually evolving and advice provided in the present is based on current standards, which may or may not be applicable when we potentially submit an NDA or an ANDA. Additionally, it is customary to reference the most similar predicate products when submitting a 505(b)(2) or ANDA application in order to potentially reduce testing requirements. However, it is important to know that:\n\u00b7\nshould a more appropriate reference product(s) be approved by the FDA at any time before or during the review of our NDA, we would be required to submit a new application referencing the more appropriate product; and\n\u00b7\nthe FDA cannot disclose whether such predicate product(s) is under development or has been submitted at any time during another company\u2019s review cycle.\nDrug delivery systems such as injectors are reviewed by the FDA and may be legally marketed as a medical device or may be evaluated as part of the drug approval process. Combination drug/device products raise unique scientific, technical and regulatory issues. The FDA has established the Office of Combination Products (\u201cOCP\u201d) to address the challenges associated with the review and regulation of combination products. The OCP assists in determining strategies for the approval of drug/delivery combinations and assuring agreement within the FDA on review responsibilities. We may seek approval for a product including an injector and a generic pharmaceutical by filing an ANDA claiming bioequivalence and the same labeling as a comparable referenced product or as a filing under Section 505(b)(2) if there is an acceptable reference product. In reviewing the ANDA filing, the agency may decide that the unique nature of combination products allows them to dispute the claims of bioequivalence and/or same labeling resulting in our re-filing the application under Section 505(b)(2). If such combination products require filing under Section 505(b)(2) we may incur delays in product approval and may incur additional costs associated with testing including clinical trials. The result of an approval for a combination product under Section 505(b)(2) may result in additional selling expenses and a decrease in market acceptance due to the lack of substitutability by pharmacies or formularies. In addition, approval under the 505(b)(2) or ANDA regulatory pathway is not a guarantee of an exclusive position for the approved product in the marketplace.\nIf the use of our injection devices require additions to or modifications of the drug labeling regulated by the FDA, the review of this labeling may be undertaken by the FDA\u2019s Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology (\u201cOSE\u201d). Additionally, the instructions for use (\u201cIFU\u201d) for a device in a drug/device combination product are also reviewed for accuracy, ease of use and educational requirements. These reviews could increase the time needed for review completion of a successful application and may require additional studies, such as usage studies, to establish the validity of the instructions. Such reviews and requirement may extend the time necessary for the approval of drug-device combinations. Such was the case for the approval of our needle-free device for use with hGH. The approval process took much more time than contemplated.\nAccordingly, these regulations and the FDA\u2019s interpretation of them might impair our ability to obtain product approval in a reasonable time, or at all, or effectively market our products.\nOur business could be harmed if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements and, as a result, are subject to sanctions.\nIf we, or pharmaceutical companies with whom we are developing technologies or who are manufacturing products on our behalf, fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the pharmaceutical companies, and we, may be subject to sanctions, including the following:\n\u00b7\nwarning letters;\n\u00b7\nfines;\n\u00b7\nproduct seizures, quarantines or recalls;\n\u00b7\ninjunctions;\n\u00b7\nrefusals to permit products to be imported into or exported out of the applicable regulatory jurisdiction;\n\u00b7\ntotal or partial suspension of production;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawals of previously approved marketing applications; or\n\u00b7\ncriminal prosecutions.\nAny relationships with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers (actual and potential) and third-party payors in connection with our current and future business activities are and will continue to be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, marketing expenditure tracking and disclosure (or \u201csunshine\u201d) laws, government price reporting, and health information privacy and security laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings.\nOur business operations and activities may be directly, or indirectly, subject to various federal, state and local fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act. These laws may impact, among other things, our current activities with principal investigators and research subjects, as well as proposed and future sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by the federal government, state governments and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, the referral of an individual for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service, or the purchase, lease, order, arrangement for, or recommendation of the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u00b7\nthe civil federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent; knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government; conspiring to defraud the government by getting a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government; or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u00b7\nthe criminal federal False Claims Act, which imposes criminal fines or imprisonment against individuals or entities who make or present a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious or fraudulent;\n\u00b7\nthe civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent;\n\u00b7\nthe Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 that requires manufacturers of \u201ccovered drugs\u201d to offer them for sale to certain federal agencies, including but not limited to, the Department of Veterans Affairs, on the Federal Supply Schedule, which requires compliance with applicable federal procurement laws and regulations and subjects manufacturers to contractual remedies as well as administrative, civil and criminal sanctions;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private), knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters;\n\u00b7\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization, including mandatory contractual terms as well as directly applicable privacy and security standards and requirements;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, created under the PPACA, and its implementing regulations requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the United States Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members, with data collection required beginning August 1, 2013 and reporting to CMS required by March 31, 2014 and by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year;\n\u00b7\nfederal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;\n\u00b7\nfederal government price reporting laws, changed by the PPACA to, among other things, increase the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and offer such rebates to additional populations, that require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs, where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on our marketed drugs. Participation in these programs and compliance with the applicable requirements may subject us to potentially significant discounts on our products, increased infrastructure costs and potentially limit our ability to offer certain marketplace discounts and failure to report accurate pricing information exposes us to federal False Claims Act liability;\n\u00b7\nthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a U.S. law which regulates certain financial relationships with foreign government officials (which could include, for example, certain medical professionals);\n\u00b7\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback, false claims, consumer protection and unfair competition laws which may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements as well as submitting claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payors, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that require drug manufacturers to file reports with states regarding marketing information, such as the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensations and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities (compliance with such requirements may require investment in infrastructure to ensure that tracking is performed properly, and some of these laws result in the public disclosure of various types of payments and relationships, which could potentially have a negative effect on our business and/or increase enforcement scrutiny of our activities); and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, with differing effects; and\n\u00b7\nthe Drug Supply Chain Security Act of 2013 imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing, and will be implemented over a 10-year period. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug products to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers' products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this new legislation, manufactures will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.\nChanges in healthcare law and implementing regulations, including those based on recently enacted legislation, as well as changes in healthcare policy, may impact our business in ways that we cannot currently predict and these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together \u201cthe Healthcare Reform Act\u201d), is a sweeping measure intended to expand healthcare coverage within the United States, primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the Medicaid program. This law substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Healthcare Reform Act contains a number of provisions that are expected to impact our business and operations, in some cases in ways we cannot currently predict. Changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, benefits for patients within a coverage gap in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program (commonly known as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d), rules regarding prescription drug benefits under the health insurance exchanges, changes to the Medicare Drug Rebate program, expansion of the Public Health Service\u2019s 340B drug pricing discount program, fraud and abuse and enforcement. These changes will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program.\nSome states have elected not to expand their Medicaid programs by raising the income limit to 133% of the federal poverty level, as is permitted under the Healthcare Reform Act. For each state that does not choose to expand its Medicaid program, there may be fewer insured patients overall, which could impact our sales, business and financial condition. Where Medicaid patients receive insurance coverage under any of the new options made available through the Healthcare Reform Act, the possibility exists that manufacturers may be required to pay Medicaid rebates on drugs used under these circumstances, a decision that could impact\nmanufacturer revenues. In addition, the federal government has also announced delays in the implementation of key provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act, including the employer mandate. The implications of these delays for our sales, business and financial condition, if any, are not yet clear.\nMoreover, legislative changes to the Healthcare Reform Act remain possible. We expect that the Healthcare Reform Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of our existing products or to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved. In addition to the Healthcare Reform Act, there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third party payors to keep healthcare costs down while expanding individual healthcare benefits.\nTo help patients afford our product OTREXUPTM, we offer discount, rebate and co-pay coupon programs. Co-pay coupon programs have received some negative publicity related to their use to promote branded pharmaceutical products over other less costly alternatives. In recent years, other pharmaceutical manufacturers have been named in class action lawsuits challenging the legality of their co-pay programs under a variety of federal and state laws. In addition, at least one insurer has directed its network pharmacies to no longer accept co-pay coupons for certain specialty drugs the insurer identified. Our co-pay coupon programs could become the target of similar lawsuits or insurer actions. It is possible that the outcome of litigation against other manufacturers, changes in insurer policies regarding co-pay coupons, and/or the introduction and enactment of new legislation or regulatory action could restrict or otherwise negatively affect these programs.\nOur revenues may be limited if the marketing claims asserted about our products are not approved.\nOnce a drug product is approved by the FDA, the Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (\u201cOPDP\u201d), the FDA\u2019s marketing surveillance department within the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, must approve marketing claims asserted by our pharmaceutical company partners. If we or a pharmaceutical company partner fails to obtain from OPDP acceptable marketing claims for a product incorporating our drug technologies, our revenues from that product may be limited. Marketing claims are the basis for a product\u2019s labeling, advertising and promotion. The claims the pharmaceutical company partners are asserting about our drug delivery technologies, or the drug product itself, may not be approved by OPDP.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nFuture conversions or exercises by holders of options could dilute our common stock.\nAs of March 1, 2016, we had options outstanding that are exercisable, at exercise prices ranging from $0.47 to $4.54 per share, for an aggregate of approximately 6,876,000 shares of our common stock. Purchasers of our common stock could therefore experience dilution of their investment upon exercise of the above options.\nSales of our common stock by our officers and directors may lower the market price of our common stock.\nAs of March 1, 2016, our officers and directors beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 16,180,000 shares (or approximately 10.2%) of our outstanding common stock, including stock options exercisable within 60 days. If our officers and directors, or other stockholders, sell a substantial amount of our common stock, it could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe intend to retain any earnings in the foreseeable future for our continued growth and, thus, do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market, such as the requirement that we maintain a minimum bid price of at least $1.00 per share, NASDAQ may take steps to de-list our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we would expect to seek to take actions to restore our compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock or prevent our common stock from dropping below the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement in the future.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be volatile and fluctuate significantly, which could result in substantial losses for investors.\nThe trading price for our common stock has been, and we expect it to continue to be, volatile. The price at which our common stock trades depends upon a number of factors, including our historical and anticipated operating results, our financial situation, announcements of technological innovations or new products by us, our partners or our competitors, our ability or inability to raise the additional capital we may need and the terms on which we raise it, and general market and economic conditions. Some of these factors are beyond our control. Broad market fluctuations may lower the market price of our common stock and affect the volume of trading in our stock, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospect. Among the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate are the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and other factors, including:\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in our quarterly operating results or the operating results of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nvariance in our financial performance from the expectations of investors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles, which could affect our financial results;\n\u00b7\nfailure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance or commercial success;\n\u00b7\nconditions and trends in the markets we serve;\n\u00b7\nchanges in general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u00b7\nsuccess of competitive products and services;\n\u00b7\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of significant new products, contracts, acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in legislation or regulatory policies, practices or actions;\n\u00b7\nthe commencement or outcome of litigation involving our company, our general industry or both;\n\u00b7\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt;\n\u00b7\nactual or expected sales of our common stock by our stockholders; and\n\u00b7\nthe trading volume of our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock markets, in general, the NASDAQ Capital Market and the market for specialty pharmaceutical companies in particular, may experience a loss of investor confidence. Such loss of investor confidence may result in extreme price and volume fluctuations in our common stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of our business, financial condition or results of operations. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock and expose us to securities class action litigation. Such litigation, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could further materially harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nAnti-takeover effects of certain certificate of incorporation and bylaw provisions could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent persons from acquiring or attempting to acquire us. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors, without action of our stockholders, to designate and issue preferred stock in one or more series, with such rights, preferences and privileges as the board of directors shall determine. In addition, our bylaws grant our board of directors the authority to adopt, amend or repeal all or any of our bylaws, subject to the power of the stockholders to change or repeal the bylaws. In addition, our bylaws limit who may call meetings of our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 88905, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "ATRS"}
