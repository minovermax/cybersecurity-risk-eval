Investors should carefully consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. If any of the following risks or other risks which have not been identified or which we may believe are immaterial or unlikely, actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. This could cause the value of our securities to decline and holders could lose part or all of their investment. This section does not describe all risks applicable to us, our business or industry, and it is intended only as a summary of certain material factors.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and the Industry\nWe have announced several restructuring actions aimed at realigning our cost structure with market demand in the paper industry and anticipate pursuing further restructuring activities in the future, all of which have and will require significant expenditures and may not be successful.\nBeginning in 2012 and continuing through the present, we have announced various operational restructuring measures in response to changed market conditions in the paper industry triggered by the structural realignment between supply of and demand for paper. For example, we have announced the termination of sales agency relationships in Europe, workforce reductions in Germany, the closure of 3 rolls facilities in France, Charlotte, North Carolina and Heidenheim, Germany and the closure of 3 machine clothing facilities in Argentina, Spain and Joao Pessoa, Brazil. We anticipate pursuing additional cost reduction programs in the future.\nIn connection with these cost reduction measures and with any future plant closures or workforce reductions, delays or failures in the transition of production from a closed facility to our other facilities or the rate of absorption of job assignments by the remaining workforce could also adversely affect our financial performance. We may not recoup the costs of programs we have already initiated, or other programs we may in the future decide to engage in, the costs of which may be significant. In addition, our profitability may decline if our restructuring efforts do not sufficiently reduce our future costs while at the same time positioning us to maintain or increase our sales and gross margins.\nOur proposed new press felt facility in Bacheng, China, our new rolls facility in Corlu, Turkey and our various expansion projects are subject to execution risk and uncertainties that could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn connection with our efforts to realign our manufacturing footprint by closing facilities in high cost regions and transferring production to lower cost regions, we are in the midst of construction on a new press felt facility in Bacheng, China and a new rolls facility in Corlu, Turkey, as well as significant expansions of several of our existing facilities. The completion of these projects are dependent upon a number of factors, many of which may be beyond our control. For example, we may experience significant delays in completing these projects because we may not able to acquire appropriate permits. We may encounter unanticipated complications with the installation and implementation of the complex systems and equipment that would impair our ability to begin production within the timeframe estimated for the projects. We also may be unable to attract a sufficient number of skilled workers to meet the needs of the new or expanded facilities.\nIn addition, the cost to implement this strategic project ultimately may prove to be greater than originally anticipated. We have spent, and intend to continue to spend, significant capital and managerial resources on these new facilities and expansions. Our Credit Facility (defined in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Credit Facility and Notes\") restricts our annual capital expenditures to $42 million per year, subject to adjustment. Dedication of our financial resources to these projects will reduce our flexibility with respect to the ongoing capital requirements of our existing business and will limit our ability to pursue other initiatives to grow our business. Furthermore, our assessment of the projected benefits associated with the construction of the new facility is subject to a number of estimates and assumptions, which in turn are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties that are beyond our control. If we incur unanticipated costs in connection with this project, are not able to complete the new facility in a timely manner or at all, or otherwise unable to achieve the anticipated benefits from this project, our business, results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected.\nNew developments and trends in the paper industry could adversely affect our net sales and profitability.\nBecause demand for our products has been driven primarily by the volume of paper produced on a worldwide basis, trends that affect the production level of the paper industry, such as declining demand for newsprint and printing and writing paper due to increased adoption of digital media, will impact our business and financial results.\nThe profitability of paper producers has historically been highly cyclical due to wide swings in the price of paper, driven to a high degree by the oversupply of paper during periods when paper producers have more aggregate capacity than the market requires. In response to significant changes in the sector and other technological shifts affecting paper consumption, paper producers have continually sought to improve the balance between the supply of and demand for paper. As part of these efforts, they have permanently shut down many paper-making machines or entire manufacturing facilities. Should papermakers continue to experience low levels of profitability, we would expect that further consolidation among papermakers, reducing the number of paper producers, and shutdowns of paper-making machines or facilities could occur, particularly in Europe and North America, until there is a better balance between supply and demand for paper and the profit levels of paper producers improve.\nGlobal paper production growth in developing markets such as Asia and South America could be moderated by the level of industry consolidation and papermachine shutdown activity that appears to be an underlying trend in developed markets. We have observed a trend that paper producers are focusing on cost reduction strategies and, as a result, are extending the life of roll covers and machine clothing products through additional maintenance cycles before replacing them. New developments and trends in the paper industry, either globally or in a particular region, could cause our paper manufacturing customers to reduce production, cease operations or declare bankruptcy, each of which would adversely affect our net sales and profitability.\nPrice competition in our industry could adversely affect our gross margins and net sales.\nHistorically, we and our competitors have been able to sell machine clothing and roll cover products and services at favorable prices that reflect the value they deliver to customers. This favorable pricing has been particularly derived from our more technologically advanced products, such as forming fabrics, press felts and advanced roll covers. In the event that competition increases due to global economic conditions or continued over capacity in the paper manufacturing industry, we may be required to price our products, in some cases, at levels insufficient to realize our historical gross margins. Such pricing pressure from our competitors might require price decreases or make us unable to affect planned price increases and, thereby, adversely affect our profitability.\nBalancing production levels at our manufacturing facilities could negatively affect our production, customer order time, product quality, labor relations or gross margin.\nAs part of our efforts to reduce our costs, we have attempted to reduce or eliminate excess manufacturing capacity through closure of certain of our manufacturing plants and consolidation of our production. As a result, however, from time to time our ability to meet customer demand for our products may rely on our ability to operate our remaining manufacturing facilities at or near capacity on an uninterrupted basis. Our manufacturing facilities are dependent on critical equipment, and operating such equipment at or near capacity for extended periods may result in increased equipment failures or other reliability problems, which may result in production shutdowns or periods of reduced production. Such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results. In addition, insufficient manufacturing capacity or other delays may cause our customer order times to increase and our product quality to decrease, which may increase warranty costs and negatively affect customer demand for our products and customer relations generally. Operating our facilities at or near capacity may also negatively affect relations with our employees, which could result in higher employee turnover, labor disputes and disruptions in our operations. On the other hand, if we anticipate or experience a significant decrease in demand for our products, we may choose to temporarily decrease production or idle manufacturing facilities and employees. While decreasing production may mitigate some of the risks of operating at or near capacity discussed above, a significant drop off in production to meet lower demand, including idling facilities or employees, may negatively impact our gross margin.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our net sales, profitability and compliance with our debt covenants.\nOur foreign operations expose us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and currency devaluations. We report our financial results in U.S. Dollars, but a substantial portion of our sales and expenses are denominated in Euros and other currencies. As a result, changes in the relative values of U.S. Dollars, Euros and other currencies will affect our levels of net sales and profitability. Currency fluctuations, as they pertain to the Euro, generally have a greater effect on the level of our net sales due to the amount of business we conduct in Euros. An increase in the U.S. Dollar against the Euro generally results in a decrease to net sales and net income. Increases in the U.S. Dollar against other currencies, such as the Brazilian Real, would not impact consolidated net sales as much, as a significant portion of sales in that country is denominated in or indexed to U.S. Dollars, but generally would increase net income as local currency costs would be translated into lower U.S. Dollar expenses for financial reporting purposes. We would expect a similar but opposite effect in a period in which the value of the U.S. Dollar decreases against these currencies. Although in certain circumstances we attempt to hedge our cash exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, our hedging strategies may not be effective.\nOur industry is competitive and our future success will depend on our ability to effectively develop, market and supply competitive products.\nThe paper-making consumables industry is highly competitive. Some of our competitors are larger than us, have greater financial and other resources and are well-established as suppliers to the markets we serve. For example, while we are targeting expansion of our business in China, we face substantial competition from manufacturers already operating there that are more established and familiar with the Chinese marketplace. In addition, some of our competitors also manufacture paper-making machines and have the ability to initially package sales of their machine clothing and roll cover products with the sale of their machines and/or to tie the warranties on their machines to the use of their machine clothing and roll cover products. Due to various factors such as price or product innovation by our competitors, our products may not be able to compete successfully\nwith the products of our competitors, which could result in a loss of customers and, as a result, decreased net sales and profitability.\nBecause we have substantial operations outside the United States, we are subject to the economic and political conditions of foreign nations.\nWe have manufacturing facilities in 12 foreign countries. In 2014, we sold products in approximately 63 countries other than the United States, which represented approximately 67% of our net sales. Operating in foreign countries presents challenges unique to each country such as in hiring employees, our relations with various parties, including suppliers and governmental agencies, and in production.\nFurthermore, we may decide to do business in countries where we have not previously done business. In such countries we face the additional uncertainty of entering a new market and its social customs, laws and practices. Should these challenges be realized, our operating results could be adversely impacted and our business or production may be delayed.\nOur foreign operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including risks that:\n\u2022\nforeign governments may impose limitations on our ability to repatriate funds;\n\u2022\nforeign governments may impose withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to us, or the amount of any such taxes may increase;\n\u2022\nan outbreak or escalation of any insurrection or armed conflict may occur;\n\u2022\nforeign governments may impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions affecting our business; or\n\u2022\nchanges in and interpretations of tax policies of foreign governments may adversely affect our foreign subsidiaries.\nThe occurrence of any of these conditions could disrupt our business in particular countries or regions of the world, or prevent us from conducting business in particular countries or regions, which could adversely affect our net sales and profitability. In addition, we rely on dividends and other payments or distributions from our subsidiaries to meet our debt obligations. If foreign governments impose limitations on our ability to repatriate funds or impose or increase taxes on remittances or other payments to us, the amount of dividends and other distributions we receive from our subsidiaries could be reduced, which could reduce the amount of cash available to us to meet our debt obligations.\nEnergy price increases may negatively impact our results of operations.\nCertain of the components that we use in our manufacturing activities are petroleum-based. In addition, we, along with our suppliers and customers, rely on various energy sources (including oil) in our transportation activities. While significant uncertainty currently exists about the future levels of energy prices, significant further increases are possible. Increased energy prices could cause an increase to our raw material costs and transportation costs. In addition, increased transportation costs of certain of our suppliers could be passed along to us. We may not be able to increase our prices enough to offset these increased costs. In addition, any increase in our prices may reduce our future customer orders and profitability.\nWe must continue to innovate and improve our products to maintain our competitive advantage.\nWe compete primarily based on the value our products delivered to our customers. Our value proposition is based on a combination of price and the technology and performance of our products, including the ability of our products to help reduce our customers\u2019 production costs and increase the quality of the paper they produce. Our ability to retain our customers and increase our business depends on our ability to continually develop new, technologically superior products that support our value proposition. We cannot assure that our investments in technological development will be sufficient, that we will be able to create and market new products, that such new products will be accepted by our customers or that we will be successful in competing against new technologies developed by competitors. In addition, either we or our competitors could develop new technologies that increase the useful life of machine clothing or roll covers, which could reduce the frequency with which our customers would need to replace their machine clothing and refurbish or replace their roll covers, and consequently lead to fewer sales.\nWe believe that market recognition of the extended life of our roll cover products and the trend towards new paper-making machine designs which have fewer rolls will continue to negatively impact the demand for our roll cover products.\nWe have seen a trend that paper producers are placing an increasingly strong emphasis on maintenance cost reduction and, as a result, are extending the life of roll covers through additional maintenance cycles before replacing them. Market recognition of the extended life of our roll cover products negatively impacts the demand for these products. In addition, we have seen a trend towards new paper-making machine designs which have fewer rolls, also negatively impacting the demand\nfor our roll cover products. If we are not able to offset these negative impacts on the demand for our roll cover products with growth from new roll cover products, the sale of roll cover products in regions which we believe have high growth potential such as China, or from other sources, the volume of our roll cover sales will be adversely affected.\nThe loss of major customers or the shut down of a mill or mills by one of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and profitability.\nOur top ten customers generated 27.1% of our net sales during 2014. The loss of major customers, financial difficulties faced by our customers or a substantial decrease in such customers\u2019 purchases from us, for instance through the closure of mill(s), could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and profitability. Because we do not generally have binding long-term purchasing agreements with our customers, there can be no assurance that our existing customers will continue to purchase products from us.\nWe may fail to adequately protect our proprietary technology, which would allow competitors or others to take advantage of our research and development efforts.\nWe rely upon trade secrets, proprietary know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop new products and remain competitive. If our competitors learn of our proprietary technology, they may use this information to produce products that are equivalent or superior to our products, which could reduce the net sales of our products. Our employees, consultants, and corporate collaborators may breach their obligations not to reveal our confidential information, and any remedies available to us may be insufficient to compensate our damages. Even in the absence of such breaches, our trade secrets and proprietary know-how may otherwise become known to our competitors, or be independently discovered by our competitors, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nOur success and ability to compete in the future may depend upon obtaining sufficient patent protection for proprietary technology.\nOur patent applications may not result in issued patents, and even if they result in issued patents, the patents may not have claims of the scope we seek. Even in the event that these patents are not issued, the applications may become publicly available and proprietary information disclosed in the applications will become available to others. In addition, any issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or declared unenforceable. The term of any issued patent in the United States is 20 years from its filing date, and if our applications are pending for a long time period, we may have a correspondingly shorter term for any patent that may be issued. Our present and future patents may provide only limited protection for our technology and may not be sufficient to provide competitive advantages to us. For example, competitors could be successful in challenging any issued patents or, alternatively, could develop similar or more advantageous technologies on their own or design around our patents. Also, patent protection in certain foreign countries may not be available or may be limited in scope and any patents obtained may not be as readily enforceable as in the United States, making it difficult for us to effectively protect our intellectual property from misuse or infringement by other companies in these countries. Our inability to obtain and enforce our intellectual property rights in some countries may harm our business. In addition, given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important.\nWe may be liable for product defects or other claims relating to our products.\nOur products could be defective, fail to perform as designed or otherwise cause harm to our customers, their equipment or their products. If any of our products are defective, we may be required to recall the products and/or repair or replace them, which could result in substantial expenses and affect our profitability. Any problems with the performance of our products could harm our reputation, which could result in a loss of sales to customers and/or potential customers. In addition, if our customers believe that they have suffered harm caused by our products, they could bring claims against us that could result in significant liability. A failure of our products could cause substantial damage to a paper-making machine. Any claims brought against us by customers may result in:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s time and attention;\n\u2022\nexpenditure of large amounts of cash on legal fees, expenses, and payment of damages;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products and services; and\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation.\nOur insurance may not sufficiently cover a large judgment against us or a large settlement payment, and is subject to customary deductibles, limits and exclusions.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nGlobal cybersecurity threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology (\"IT\") systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats. While we employ comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems), cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur future success depends on the continued contributions of our key senior management personnel, including members of our senior sales staff and research and development team. The loss of services of any one or more of our key personnel might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could cause us to incur additional costs to recruit replacements. Each member of our executive management team may terminate his or her employment at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance with respect to any of our executives.\nWe could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under laws protecting the environment and human health.\nOur operations and facilities are subject to a number of national, state and local laws and regulations protecting the environment and human health in the United States and foreign countries that govern, among other things, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, discharges of pollutants into the air and water and workplace safety. The U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended provides for responses to, and, in some instances, joint and several liability for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Environmental laws also hold current owners or operators of land or businesses liable for their own and for previous owners\u2019 or operators\u2019 releases of hazardous or toxic substances, materials or wastes, pollutants or contaminants, including petroleum and petroleum products. Because of our operations, the history of industrial uses at some of our facilities, the operations of predecessor owners or operators of some of the businesses, and the use and release of hazardous substances at these sites, the liability provisions of environmental laws may affect us. Many of our facilities have experienced some level of regulatory scrutiny in the past and are or may be subject to further regulatory inspections, future requests for investigation or liability for regulated materials management practices.\nWe cannot assure that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to us which are designed to protect the environment and human health. We could incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, fines and sanctions and third party property damage or personal injury claims, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws, relevant common law or the environmental permits required for our operations or under workplace safety laws. While we believe that the current level of reserves is adequate, the adequacy of these reserves may change in the future due to new developments in particular matters.\nAdverse labor relations could harm our operations and reduce our profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately 3,100 employees worldwide, approximately 15% of whom were subject to protection of various North American collective bargaining agreements and approximately 55% of whom were subject to job protection as members of European or South American trade unions, employee associations or workers\u2019 councils. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 57% of the employees subject to North American collective bargaining agreements (or approximately 9% of our total employees) were covered by an agreement that is set to expire prior to December 31, 2015. We cannot be certain that we will be able to renew the collective bargaining agreement set to expire this year, or enter into a new collective bargaining agreement that does not adversely affect our operating results, or that we will be without production interruptions, including labor stoppages. In addition, all of our European and South American employees subject to job protection as members of trade unions, employee associations or workers\u2019 councils are subject to arrangements that typically result in higher negotiated or mandated salary increases on either an annual or biannual basis. We cannot be certain that the terms of employment applicable to such employees will not change in the future in a manner which adversely affects our operating results. We cannot be certain that we will not experience disruptions in our operations as a result of labor disputes or experience other labor relations issues. If we are unable to maintain good relations with our employees, our ability to produce our products and provide services to our customers could be reduced and/or our production costs could increase, either of which could disrupt our business and reduce our net sales and profitability.\nWe may be subject to assessment of income taxes for which we have not accrued any liability.\nWe accrue for certain known and reasonably anticipated income tax obligations after assessing the likely outcome. In the event that actual results differ from these accruals or if we become subject to a tax obligation for which we have made no accrual, we may need to make adjustments, which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. For example, taxing authorities may disagree with our tax accounting methodologies and may subject us to inquiries regarding such taxes, which potentially could result in additional income tax assessments against us. In accordance with accounting rules, we do not accrue for potential income tax obligations if we deem a particular tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. In making our determination, we assume that the taxing authorities will have access to all relevant facts and information.\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Structure\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to plan for and react to changes in the economy, our industry or our business and prevent us from meeting our debt obligations.\nWe are significantly leveraged. As of December 31, 2014, our total indebtedness was approximately $469.4 million. Our substantial degree of leverage could have important consequences to us, including the following:\n\u2022\nit may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\na substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including our operations, capital expenditures, and other business opportunities;\n\u2022\ncertain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our Credit Facility, are at variable rates of interest, exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates;\n\u2022\nif we seek to refinance our debt or require additional refinancing in the future, we may be unable to do so on attractive terms or at all;\n\u2022\nit may limit our flexibility in planning for, or our ability to adjust to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate, and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nwe may be vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business, or we may be unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth.\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks described above.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the indenture governing our 8.875% senior unsecured notes due 2018 (the \"Notes\") do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so. If we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the Notes, the holders of that new debt will be entitled to share ratably with the Note holders in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding-up of us. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to our Note holders. Additionally, our Credit Facility includes up to a $55.0 million committed revolving credit facility, under which we may borrow from time to time. Furthermore, we have an uncommitted incremental credit facility allowing for increases under the revolving credit facility and term loans, and borrowing of new tranches of term loans, in each case, up to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the greater of (i) $45.0 million and (ii) our and our subsidiaries\u2019 Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreement governing our Credit Facility) for the most recent four fiscal quarters. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Credit Facility and Notes\u201d for a more complete description of the terms and features of the Credit Facility and the Notes.\nOur Credit Facility and the indenture governing our Notes include a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur Credit Facility and the indenture governing our Notes include a number of customary and significant restrictions and covenants, subject to certain exceptions, that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions on capital stock or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or purchase debt;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures in excess of $42 million per fiscal year, subject to adjustment;\n\u2022\ncreate restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us;\n\u2022\nsell stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ntransfer or sell assets;\n\u2022\ncreate liens and engage in sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\namend or otherwise alter debt and certain other material agreements\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nenter into mergers or consolidations.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our Credit Facility, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our Credit Facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our Credit Facility. If the lenders under our Credit Facility accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our Credit Facility and our other indebtedness, including the Notes, or borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, or terms that are acceptable to us.\nFluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our liquidity, interest expense and financial results.\nThe term loans under our Credit Facility have variable interest rates. To the extent that we do not enter into hedging arrangements that effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of our senior debt, the interest rate on all of the debt covered by our Credit Facility will fluctuate based on LIBOR, Euribor and other variable interest rates. To the extent these interest rates increase, our interest expense may increase, in which event, we may have difficulty making interest payments and funding our other costs and our ability to comply with the financial covenants in our Credit Facility may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our future operating performance will generate sufficient cash flows to support our cash requirements. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including the Credit Facility or the indenture that governs our Notes. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. Our Credit Facility and the indenture that governs the Notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result our debt holders could declare all outstanding debt to be due and payable; the lenders under our Credit Facility could terminate their commitments to lend us money, declare all outstanding amounts there under due and payable, and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings; and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which could result in our security holders\u2019 loss of their investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Notes\nNot all of our subsidiaries guarantee our obligations under the Notes, and the Notes are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.\nThe Notes are guaranteed by each of our existing and subsequently acquired, direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. Except for such subsidiary guarantors of the Notes, our subsidiaries, including all of our foreign subsidiaries and our subsidiaries that are less than wholly-owned, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make any funds available to pay those amounts, whether by dividend, distribution, loan or other payment.\nThe Notes are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other obligations of any non-guarantor subsidiary, even if such obligations do not constitute senior indebtedness, such that, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of any non-guarantor subsidiary, all of such subsidiary\u2019s creditors (including trade creditors and preferred stockholders, if any) would be entitled to payment in full out of such subsidiary\u2019s assets before we would be entitled to any payment. As a result, the Notes are effectively subordinated to all liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.\nOur non-guarantor subsidiaries also may be subject to restrictions on their ability to distribute cash to us as a result of law and, as a result, we may not be able to access their cash flows to service our debt obligations, including the Notes.\nOur non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately $395.8 million or 72.9% of our net sales for year ended December 31, 2014 and $480.9 million or 80.9% of our total assets and $257.7 million or 38.6% of our total liabilities as of December 31, 2014.\nA Note holder\u2019s right to receive payments on the Notes is effectively junior to those lenders who have a security interest in our assets.\nOur obligations under the Notes and the guarantors\u2019 obligations under their guarantees of the Notes are unsecured. As a result, the Notes and the related guarantees are effectively subordinated to all of our and the guarantors\u2019 secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. Our obligations under our Credit Facility are secured by a pledge of substantially all of our and our guarantors\u2019 tangible and intangible assets. In the event that we or a guarantor are declared bankrupt, become insolvent or are liquidated or reorganized, our obligations under our Credit Facility and any other secured obligations will be entitled to be paid in full from our assets or the assets of such guarantor, as the case may be, pledged as security for such obligation before any payment may be made with respect to the Notes. Holders of the Notes would participate ratably in our remaining assets or the remaining assets of the guarantor, as the case may be, with all holders of unsecured indebtedness that are deemed to rank equally with the Notes, based upon the respective amount owed to each creditor. In addition, if we default under our Credit Facility, the lenders could declare all of the funds borrowed thereunder, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay such indebtedness, the lenders could foreclose on the pledged assets to the exclusion of holders of the Notes, even if an event of default exists under the indenture under which the Notes were issued at such time. Furthermore, if the lenders foreclose and sell the pledged equity interests in any subsidiary guarantor under the Notes, then that subsidiary guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the Notes automatically and immediately upon such sale. In any such event, because the Notes are not secured by any of our assets or the equity interests in subsidiary guarantors, it is possible that there would be no assets remaining from which Note holder claims could be satisfied or, if any assets remained, they might be insufficient to satisfy Note holder claims fully.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we and our guarantor subsidiaries had $226.1 million of secured indebtedness under our Credit Facility which does not include additional borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility or incremental facility. The indenture governing the Notes permits the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness by us and our restricted subsidiaries in the future, including secured indebtedness. Any secured indebtedness incurred would rank senior to the Notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.\nOur ability to repay the Notes depends on the performance of our subsidiaries, including our non-guarantor subsidiaries, and their ability to make payments or distributions.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness, including the Notes, is dependent, to a significant extent, on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of the Notes, our subsidiaries, including all of our foreign subsidiaries, do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Notes. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. While the indenture governing the Notes limits the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions.\nIf cash flow from our U.S. operations is insufficient to make payments of principal and interest on our debt, including amounts due under the Notes, we must rely on cash flow from our foreign operations to make these payments.\nIn addition, our ability to repatriate cash generated by our foreign operations or borrow from our foreign subsidiaries may be limited by tax, foreign exchange or other laws. Foreign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements for foreign taxes. Cash we hold in foreign entities may become subject to exchange controls that prevent their being converted into other currencies, including dollars. Foreign tax laws may affect our ability to repatriate cash from foreign subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner or at all. Legal and contractual dividend restrictions may prevent foreign subsidiaries from paying dividends or other cash distributions to service payments on the Notes, and directors and officers of such foreign subsidiaries may therefore be unable or unwilling to authorize such payments or such loans. If these or other risks limit our ability to transfer cash generated by our foreign operations to us, our ability to make payments on our debt, including amounts due under the Notes, would be harmed.\nWe may not be able to satisfy our obligations to holders of the Notes upon a change in control.\nIn the event of a change in control, each Note holder may require us to purchase all or a portion of his or her Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of purchase. Our ability to repurchase the Notes upon a change in control is limited by the terms of our Credit Facility and our other debt. Upon a change in control, we may be required immediately to repay the outstanding principal, any accrued interest and any other amounts owed by us under the Credit Facility. There can be no assurance that we would be able to repay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility or obtain necessary consents under the Credit Facility to repurchase the Notes. Any requirement to offer to purchase any outstanding Notes may result in us having to refinance our other outstanding debt, which we may not be able to do. In addition, even if we were able to refinance this debt, the refinancing may not be on terms favorable to us. Our failure to purchase the Notes would be a default under the indenture governing the Notes.\nThe change in control provision in the indenture may not protect Note holders in the event we consummate a highly leveraged transaction, reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction, unless such transaction constitutes a change in control under the indenture. Such a transaction may not involve a change in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if it does, may not involve a change of the magnitude required under the definition of change in control triggering event in the indenture to trigger our obligation to repurchase the Notes. Except as described above, the indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require us to repurchase or redeem the Notes in an event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.\nOur Notes are not listed on an exchange and the market price for our Notes may be volatile.\nOur Notes are not listed on an exchange and we do not know if or when an active trading market for our Notes will develop, if at all. In addition, the market for non-investment-grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to our Notes. The market for our Notes, if any, may be subject to similar disruptions, and any such disruptions may adversely affect their value. Holders may not be able to sell their Notes at a particular time or at a favorable price.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nWe do not anticipate paying a dividend on our common stock in the foreseeable future, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur Credit Facility and the indenture governing our Notes limit or prohibit the payment of dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. The lack of dividend payments may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile since our initial public offering and may continue to be volatile.\nShares of our common stock may continue to experience substantial price volatility, including significant decreases, in response to a number of events, including:\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by principal stockholders;\n\u2022\nour quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nissuances of our common stock;\n\u2022\nfuture announcements concerning our business;\n\u2022\nour dividend policy;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock and/or changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nactions of competitors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in U.S. and foreign government regulation;\n\u2022\ngeneral market, economic and political conditions; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, terrorist attacks and acts of war.\nOn December 31, 2014, the last trading day in 2014, the closing price of our common stock was $15.78 as compared with $16.49 as of December 31, 2013. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, the lowest trading price of our common stock was $11.20 and the highest trading price was $17.99.\nSome companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities class action lawsuits filed against them. Such lawsuits, should they be filed against us in the future, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of\nmanagement\u2019s attention and resources. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain shareholders have significant influence over our business and significant transactions.\nOn the date we emerged from bankruptcy protection, referred to as the Effective Date, by operation of the plan of reorganization, all of our common stock then outstanding, par value $0.01 or old common stock, was canceled and approximately 82.6% of our new common stock, par value $0.001 was issued to our lenders. Holders of our old common stock were issued approximately 17.4% of the new common stock, along with warrants to purchase up to an additional 10% of the new common stock outstanding on the Effective Date on a fully diluted basis. Also pursuant to the plan of reorganization, a majority of the directors serving on our reconstituted Board of Directors were nominated by certain of our then-lenders, including American Securities LLC (together with its affiliates, \u201cAmerican Securities\u201d) and Carl Marks Strategic Investments, L.P. (together with its affiliates, \u201cCarl Marks\u201d). We also entered into director nomination agreements with certain of our then-lenders, including American Securities and Carl Marks, pursuant to which the applicable lender(s) may designate one individual for nomination to our Board of Directors, so long as the lender(s) continues to own at least 50% of the new common stock issued to such lender(s) under the plan of reorganization.\nAs of February 27, 2015, Carl Marks owned 13.4% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Mr. Wilson, who is a general partner of Carl Marks Management Company, is also our Chairman of the Board. As a result, Carl Marks has a strong ability to influence our business, policies and affairs, and we cannot be certain that their interests will be consistent with the interests of other holders of our common stock. Additionally, because American Securities, which owns 14.0% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of February 27, 2015, has the right to appoint a director nominee to the Board pursuant to the Director Nomination Agreement, if American Securities chose to exercise that right, the individual they select would also have a strong ability to influence our business, policies and affairs, and we could not be certain that their interests would be consistent with the interests of other holders of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 1 million shares of preferred stock (of which 20,000 shares have been designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock) and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders.\nThe rights of the holders of our common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock. For instance, we previously adopted a shareholder rights plan, which has since lapsed, that if implemented could have substantially diluted the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take us over without the approval of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors could choose to adopt a stockholder rights plan in the future that may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire us (or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock) without first negotiating with our Board of Directors regarding that acquisition.\nFurther, some provisions of our charter documents, including provisions eliminating the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent and limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice, may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock. In addition, our charter documents do not permit cumulative voting, which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our Board of Directors. Further, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which will prohibit us from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, even if such combination is favored by a majority of stockholders, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The application of Section 203 also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company.", "PERMNO": 90700, "SIC": 3550, "TIC": "XRM"}
