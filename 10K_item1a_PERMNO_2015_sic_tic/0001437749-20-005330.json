{"cik": "1089511", "company": "ALASKA COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe face a variety of risks that may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, some of which are beyond our control. The risks described below are not the only ones we face and should be considered in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the SEC, including our subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nCompetition\nThe telecommunications industry in Alaska is competitive and creates pressure on our pricing and customer retention efforts.\nStrong competitors make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers, which could result in lower revenue, cash flow from operating activities and Adjusted Free Cash Flow.\nOur principal facilities-based competitor for voice and broadband services is GCI, who is also the dominant cable television provider in Alaska. In the business and wholesale market, GCI holds a dominant position through its extensive fiber optic, microwave and satellite based middle mile network as well as its undersea fiber cable network, where it owns and operates two of the four existing undersea fiber optic cables connecting Alaska to the contiguous states. In the consumer market, GCI bundles its cable video services with voice, broadband and mobile wireless services. Because the video and mobile wireless services we offer are limited, we are unable to offer competing bundles.\nGCI continues to expand its statewide reach, including through its Terra Southwest project which is funded with federal subsidies, consisting of grants from the USDA Rural Utilities Service and federal low-interest loans. This subsidy gives GCI a substantial competitive advantage in the markets served by Terra Southwest, and GCI receives substantial additional funding for services offered over this facility from the federal E-Rate and Rural Health Care universal service support mechanisms. GCI has indicated it intends to replicate this government subsidized model in other markets in Alaska, which will create monopoly-type conditions in these markets which are subject to minimal regulatory oversight.\nWith a long history of operating in Alaska, AT&T has a terrestrial long-haul network in Alaska where the focus is on serving certain national customers. AT&T\u2019s primary mass market focus in Alaska is providing mobile wireless services.\nAs we compete more extensively in the managed IT services business, we are likely to face new competition, both local and national. There are other small firms that compete for IT business in Alaska. Overall, however, we believe that competition for managed IT services is fragmented in Alaska with no clear or dominant provider.\nDiversification of Our Sources of Revenue\nWe may not be able to adequately diversify our revenue stream which could create risk to our ability to generate cash and bottom-line growth.\nThe telecommunications industry faces frequent and rapid changes in products and services provided to customers. If we do not adequately investigate and assess the expansion of our existing sources of revenue, including new products and services and strategic acquisition opportunities, our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity may be impacted.\nOur Cost Structure\nWe may not be able to maintain our cost structure which would create risk to our ability to generate bottom-line growth.\nAs a smaller, focused broadband and managed IT services company, maintaining a lower cost structure is key to generating cash flow from operating activities. If we fail to maintain this cost structure, our financial position, results of operations and liquidity will be impacted.\nTechnological Advancements and Changes in Telecommunications Standards\nIf we do not adapt to rapid technological advancements and changes in telecommunications standards, our ability to compete could be strained, and as a result, we would lose customers.\nOur success will likely depend on our ability to adapt and fund the rapid technological changes in our industry. Our failure to adopt a new technology or our choice of one technology over another may have an adverse effect on our ability to compete or meet the demands of our customers. Technological changes could, among other things, reduce the barriers to entry facing our competitors providing local service in our service areas. The pace of technology change and our ability to deploy new technologies may be constrained by insufficient capital and/or the need to generate sufficient cash to make interest payments on our debt.\nNew products and services may arise out of technological developments and our inability to keep pace with these developments may reduce the attractiveness of our services. Some of our competitors may have greater resources to respond to changing technology than we do. If we fail to adapt successfully to technological changes or fail to obtain access to new technologies, we could lose customers and be unable to attract new customers and/or sell new services to our existing customers. We may be unable to successfully deliver new products and services, and we may not generate anticipated revenues from such products or services.\nTo be competitive we need to maintain an on-going investment program to continuously upgrade our access network. We define the access network as the connection from the end user location - either a home or a business - to the first aggregation point in the network. The connection can be copper or fiber and the aggregation point is typically a central office or remote serving node. The access network determines the speeds we are able to deliver to our end customer. We may not be able to maintain the level of investment needed for long term competitiveness in offering broadband speeds to all segments of our market.\nTechnology trends and developments in the area of IT and cloud services can be far more disruptive and tend to change in shorter cycles compared to telecommunications technologies. Our ability to invest in the training, certifications, and skills required to develop these partnerships will be important in determining our success in this area of managed IT services.\nOur limited access to middle mile infrastructure limits our ability to compete in certain geographic and customer segments in Alaska.\nWe define middle mile as the connection between the first aggregation point into a local community and the interconnection point to the internet or switch which connects the community to the outside world. These are typically high capacity connections and can span hundreds of miles in the case of Alaska. It is unlikely that we will have the capital needed for middle mile investments, and GCI controls significant elements of the middle mile network in Alaska, and through its government funded programs is creating monopoly conditions in certain areas of the state. This limits our ability to compete in those markets.\nRisks Relating to Our Debt\nOur debt could adversely affect our financial health, financing options and liquidity position. Due to uncertainty in the capital markets, we may be unable to retire or refinance our long-term debt when it becomes due, or if we are able to refinance it, we may not be able to do so with attractive interest rates or terms.\n2019 Senior Credit Facility\nOn January 15, 2019, we entered into an amended and restated credit facility consisting of a term facility in the amount of $180 million, a revolving facility in an amount not to exceed $20 million and a delayed-draw term facility in an amount not to exceed $25 million (together the \u201c2019 Senior Credit Facility\u201d). The 2019 Senior Credit Facility also provides for incremental term loans up to an aggregate principal amount of the greater of $60 million or trailing twelve-month EBITDA (as defined in the facility).\nPrincipal payments on the term facilities are due commencing in the third quarter of 2019 as follows: the third quarter of 2019 through the second quarter of 2020 - $1,125 per quarter; the third quarter of 2020 through the second quarter of 2022 - $2,250 per quarter; the third quarter of 2022 through the second quarter of 2023 - $3,375 per quarter; and the third quarter of 2023 through the fourth quarter of 2023 - $4,500 per quarter. The remaining outstanding principal balance, including any amounts outstanding under the revolving facility, is due on January 15, 2024. This schedule is subject to mandatory prepayments under certain conditions, including the Company\u2019s generation of excess cash flow as defined in the facility.\nThe obligations under the 2019 Senior Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of the personal property and real property of the Company.\nThe 2019 Senior Credit Facility contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting the incurrence of debt, the payment of dividends and repurchase of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe 2019 Senior Credit Facility provides for events of default customary for credit facilities of this type, including non-payment defaults on other debt, misrepresentation, breach of covenants, representations and warranties, change of control, and insolvency and bankruptcy.\nOur debt also exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. As a component of our cash flow hedging strategy and as required under the terms of the 2019 Senior Credit Facility, we hold pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swaps in the total initial notional amount of $135.0 million at 6.1735%, inclusive of a 4.5% LIBOR spread, through June 2022. The anticipated elimination of LIBOR and subsequent replacement with an alternative base rate could negatively impact our cost of borrowing.\nAdditional information is in the \u201cFirst Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of January 15, 2019, by and among Alaska Communications, as the borrower, the Company and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, as guarantors, ING Capital LLC, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto,\u201d filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 22, 2019, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nWe are also subject to credit risk related to our counterparties on the swaps and to interest rate fluctuations on interest generated by our debt in excess of the notional term loans referenced above.\nRisks Related to our Business\nRural Health Care Universal Service Support Program\nWe may not receive some of the subsidies for Rural Health Care for which our customers have applied and amounts previously received may be challenged.\nThe Company received inquiries and requests for information from USAC, which administers the program, in connection with both current funding requests and, beginning with a letter dated June 2, 2017 from USAC\u2019s auditors, prior period support payments. After the Company responded to the initial request, USAC\u2019s auditors asked the Company to comment on some preliminary audit findings, and the Company responded with a letter dated December 21, 2018. On February 24, 2020, the Company received a draft audit report from USAC that is described more fully in Note 20 \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The draft audit report alleges violations of the FCC\u2019s rules for establishing rural rates and urban rates, the provisioning and billing of ineligible services and products, and violations of the FCC\u2019s competitive bidding rules. The Company is engaged in dialogue with USAC\u2019s auditors and continues to work constructively with USAC towards a resolution. At this time, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of this audit. Similar audits of other companies have resulted in the FCC recouping certain previously awarded support funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nIn addition, the Company received a letter of inquiry from the FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau on March 23, 2018 regarding the Company\u2019s participation in the Rural Healthcare Program. On November 5, 2019, and January 22, 2020, the Company received additional letters from the FCC Enforcement Bureau requesting supplementary information. The Company has responded to all such letters from the FCC except that its response to the January 22, 2020 letter remains in process. The FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau is still conducting its inquiry, and as of the date of this Form 10-K, has yet to assert any claims or rule violations. At this time, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of this inquiry. Similar investigations of other companies have resulted in the FCC imposing penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nThe rising uncertainty and unpredictability in the Rural Health Care program negatively impacted the Company in 2017, 2018 and 2019, and may have a negative impact on future revenue and demand for our services from rural healthcare providers.\nAlso, we may be subject to further audits, inquiries or investigations of the Company\u2019s compliance with FCC rules governing the Rural Healthcare Program for prior periods. We are unable to predict the duration, scope, or outcome of any audit, inquiry or investigation into these matters, and any remedial action taken against the Company could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nAccess and High Cost Support Revenue\nRevenues from access charges will continue to decline and revenue from various regulated support mechanisms is subject to rule changes at the FCC and the RCA.\nWe received approximately 1.7% and 2.0% of our operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, from access charges. The amount of revenue that we receive from these access charges is calculated in accordance with requirements set by the FCC and the RCA. Any change in these requirements may reduce our revenues and earnings. Access charges have consistently decreased in past years and we expect this trend to continue due to declines in legacy regulated products, changes in regulations, and migration to VoIP services which do not generate access revenue for us.\nSome access charges have already been reduced to zero. Further elimination of access revenue would have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings.\nRegulations\nNew governmental regulations may impose obligations on us to upgrade our existing technology or adopt new technology that may require additional capital and we may not be able to comply in a timely or economic manner with these new regulations.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which the government will impose new unfunded mandates on us. Such mandates have included those related to emergency location, emergency \u201cE-911\u201d calling, law enforcement assistance and local number portability. Each of these government mandates has imposed new requirements for capital that we could not have predicted with any precision. Along with these obligations, the FCC has imposed deadlines for compliance with these mandates. We may not be able to provide services that comply with these or other regulatory mandates. Further, we cannot predict whether other mandates from the FCC or other regulatory authorities will occur in the future or the demands they may place on our capital expenditures. For more information on our regulatory environment and the risks it presents to us, see \u201cItem 1, Business - Regulation\u201d.\nThere is a risk that FCC Orders will materially impact our revenue.\nThe 2011 Transformation Order established a new framework for high cost universal service support that replaced existing support mechanisms that provide support to carriers, like us, that serve high-cost areas with new CAF support mechanisms and service obligations that are focused on broadband Internet access services. We recognized $19.7 million in federal high cost universal service payment revenues to support our wireline operations in high cost areas in each of the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The FCC released its CAF Phase II order, specific to the Company, on October 31, 2016. As a result, we currently expect our high cost support revenue to be relatively unchanged for the next six years. Substantial changes are expected to be enacted by the FCC regarding our high cost support funding after 2025, and there is uncertainty regarding the future level of revenue as well as the future obligations tied to this funding. If we fail to meet our obligations under the CAF Phase II order, our revenue, results of operations and liquidity may be impacted.\nWe make substantial contributions to the Universal Service Fund and our methods for computing our contributions to that fund may be challenged.\nThe FCC order released on August 20, 2019 clarified its position that only Telecommunications Services were supported under the Rural Health Care Telecom Program. On December 26, 2019, the FCC issued public notices seeking comments on proposed changes to the 2020 FCC Form 499-A. The proposed changes would clarify the reporting of funds remitted from USAC under the Rural Health Care program. This clarification reduced our risk for future filings. However, our past filings of certain services as \u201cInformation Services\u201d not subject to such contributions could ultimately prove to be inconsistent with the FCC\u2019s views, which could trigger additional USF contribution obligations.\nWe are unable to predict the duration, scope, or outcome of any investigation into these matters and any remedial action taken against the Company in connection with them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nAlaska\u2019s Economic Conditions\nThe successful operation and growth of our businesses depends on economic conditions in Alaska which may deteriorate due to reductions in crude oil prices and other factors.\nThe vast majority of our customers and operations are located in Alaska. Due to our geographical concentration, the successful operation and growth of our businesses depends on economic conditions in Alaska. The Alaska economy, in turn, depends upon many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe strength of the natural resources industries, particularly oil production and prices of crude oil;\n\u25cf\nthe strength of the Alaska tourism industry;\n\u25cf\nthe level of government and military spending; and\n\u25cf\nthe continued growth of service industries.\nThe population of Alaska, which declined marginally in 2018 and 2019, is approximately 730,000 with Anchorage, Fairbanks and Juneau serving as the primary population and economic centers in the state.\nIt is estimated that one-third of Alaska\u2019s economy is dependent on federal spending, one-third on natural resources, in particular the production of crude oil, and the remaining one-third on other activities such as tourism, mining, timber, seafood, international air cargo and miscellaneous support services.\nAlaska\u2019s economy is dependent on investment by oil companies, and state tax revenues correlate with the price of oil as the State assesses a tax based on the value of the oil that transits the pipeline from the North Slope. British Petroleum, one of the world\u2019s major oil companies, is exiting Alaska and its Alaska operations and holdings are being taken over by a much smaller local company. The impact of this change on the State\u2019s economy is uncertain.\nOverall economic impacts from a sustained lower price of crude oil and population declines, if maintained over time, will impact our growth in the future.\nNorth Slope Fiber Optic Network\nOur project to provide broadband solutions to the North Slope and western Alaska may not prove to be as successful as currently anticipated.\nDuring the second quarter of 2015, we acquired a fiber optic network on the North Slope of Alaska and initiated a project to operate and expand the network. This network enables commercially-available, high-speed connectivity where only high-cost microwave and satellite communications were previously available. The success of this project is dependent, in part, on the utilization of the network by other telecom carriers.\nOur co-owner in this project has invested in a submarine network with landing stations in several northwest Alaska communities, including a terrestrial route from the North Slope to Fairbanks. The network became operational in late 2017 and we began delivering service to customers in 2018 through capacity we acquired on the system. Delays in acquiring customers and providing those customers with service could negatively impact our investment in the system and our financial results.\nErosion of Access Lines\nWe provide services to many customers over access lines, and if we continue to lose access lines, our revenues, earnings and cash flow from operating activities may decrease.\nOur business generates revenue by delivering voice and data services over access lines. We have experienced net access line loss over the past few years and the rate of loss has been accelerating. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 our business access line erosion was 2,134 and 2,317, respectively, while over the same period our consumer access line erosion was 2,920 and 3,478 respectively. We expect to continue to experience net access line loss in our markets, affecting our revenues, earnings and cash flow from operating activities.\nNetwork / E-911 Failure\nA failure of our network could cause significant delays or interruptions of service, which could cause us to lose customers.\nTo be successful, we will need to continue to provide our customers reliable service over our network. Our network and infrastructure are constantly at risk of physical damage as a result of human, natural or other factors. These factors may include pandemics, acts of terrorism, sabotage, natural disasters, power surges or outages, software defects, contractor or vendor failures, labor disputes and other disruptions that may be beyond our control. Should we experience a prolonged system failure or a significant service interruption, our customers may choose a different provider and our reputation may be damaged. Further, we may not have adequate insurance coverage, which would result in unexpected expense. Notably, similar to other undersea fiber optic cable operators, we do not carry insurance that would cover the cost of repair of our undersea cables and, thus, we would bear the full cost of any necessary repairs.\nA failure of enhanced emergency calling services associated with our network may harm our business.\nWe provide E-911 service to our customers where such service is available. We also contract from time to time with municipalities to upgrade their dispatch capabilities such that those facilities become capable of receiving our transmission of a 911 caller\u2019s location information and telephone number. If the emergency call center is unable to process such information, the caller is provided only basic 911 services. In these instances, the emergency caller may be required to verbally advise the operator of such caller\u2019s location at the time of the call. Any inability of the dispatchers to automatically recognize the caller\u2019s location or telephone number, whether or not it occurs as a result of our network operations, may cause us to incur liability or cause our reputation or financial results to suffer.\nActions of Activist Stockholders\nActions of activist stockholders against us could be disruptive and costly and the possibility that activist stockholders may wage proxy contests or seek representation on, or control of, our Board could cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business, and an activist campaign that results in a change in control of our Board could trigger change in control provisions or payments under certain of our material contracts and agreements.\nStockholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations, advance stockholder proposals or board nominations or otherwise attempt to effect changes, assert influence or acquire some level of control over us.\nWhile our Board and management team strive to maintain constructive, ongoing communications with all of the Company\u2019s stockholders and welcomes their views and opinions with the goal of enhancing value for all stockholders, an activist campaign that seeks to replace more than a majority of the members of our Board and, thereby seek control of the Company\u2019s Board, could have an adverse effect on us because:\n\u25cf\nResponding to actions by activist stockholders can disrupt our operations, are costly and time-consuming, and divert the attention of our Board and senior management team from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition;\n\u25cf\nPerceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of changes to the composition of our Board may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential clients, may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners;\n\u25cf\nThese types of actions could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business; and\n\u25cf\nIf individuals are elected to our Board with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our stockholders.\nEmployees\nWe depend on the availability of personnel with the requisite level of technical expertise in the telecommunications industry.\nOur ability to develop and maintain our networks and execute our business plan is dependent on the availability of technical engineering, IT, service delivery and monitoring, product development, sales, management, finance and other key personnel within our geographic location.\nLabor costs and the terms of our principal collective bargaining agreement can negatively impact our ability to remain competitive, which could cause our financial performance to suffer.\nLabor costs are a significant component of our expenses and, as of December 31, 2019, approximately 54% of our workforce is represented by the IBEW. The collective bargaining agreement between the Company and the IBEW, which is effective through December 31, 2023, governs the terms and conditions of employment for all IBEW represented employees working for the Company in the state of Alaska and has significant economic impacts on the Company as it relates to wage and benefit costs and work rules. We believe our labor costs are higher than our competitors who employ a non-unionized workforce because we are required by the CBA to contribute to the IBEW Health and Welfare Trust and the Alaska Electrical Pension Fund (\u201cAEPF\u201d) for benefit programs, including defined benefit pension plans and health benefit plans, that are not reflective of the competitive marketplace. Furthermore, work rules under the existing agreement limit our ability to efficiently manage our workforce and make the incremental cost of work performed outside normal work hours high. In addition, we may make strategic and operational decisions that require the consent of the IBEW. While we believe our relationship with the IBEW is constructive, and although the IBEW generally has provided necessary consents, the IBEW may not provide consent when we need it, it may require additional wages, benefits or other consideration be paid in return for its consent, or it may call for a work stoppage against the Company. The Company considered relations with the IBEW to be stable in 2019; however, any deterioration in the relationship with the IBEW would have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe expansion of represented employees outside of Alaska could affect our cost structure and the success of any strategic expansion opportunities.\nVendors\nWe rely on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors for timely supply of equipment and services for our network infrastructure and customer support services. If these suppliers or vendors experience problems or favor our competitors, we could fail to obtain the equipment and services we require to operate our business successfully.\nSuppliers that use proprietary technology, effectively lock us into one or a few suppliers for key network components. Other suppliers require us to maintain exclusive relationships under a contract. As a result, we have become reliant upon a limited number of suppliers of network equipment. In the event it becomes necessary to seek alternative suppliers and vendors, we may be unable to obtain satisfactory replacement suppliers or vendors on economically attractive terms on a timely basis, or at all, which could increase costs and may cause disruption in service.\nIf suppliers of our equipment or providers of services on which we rely experience financial difficulties, service or billing interruptions, patent litigation or other problems, subscriber growth and our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nNetworks, Monitoring Centers and Data Hosting Facilities\nMaintaining the Company\u2019s networks, around the clock monitoring centers and data hosting facilities requires significant capital expenditures, and our inability or failure to maintain and upgrade our networks and data centers would have a material impact on our market share and ability to generate revenue.\nThe Company currently operates an extensive network that includes monitoring and hosting facilities. To provide contractual levels of service to our customers and remain competitive, we must expend significant amounts of capital. In many cases, we must rely on outside vendors whose performance and costs may not be sufficiently within our control.\nInformation Technology Systems\nA failure of back-office IT systems could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe efficient operation of the Company\u2019s business depends on back-office IT systems. The Company relies on back-office IT systems, including certain systems provided by third party vendors, to effectively manage customer billing, business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment and other business processes. Some of these systems are no longer supported under maintenance agreements from the underlying vendor. Initiation of new systems may not be successful, may be delayed, and may cost more than expected. A failure of the Company\u2019s IT systems, or the IT systems provided by third party vendors, to perform as anticipated could disrupt the Company\u2019s business and result in a failure to collect accounts receivable, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing the Company\u2019s reputation and results of operations to suffer. In addition, IT systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond the Company\u2019s control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches and viruses. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and financial condition.\nUndersea Fiber Optic Cable Systems\nIf failures occur in our undersea fiber optic cable systems, our ability to restore our service may be delayed or otherwise limited.\nOur undersea fiber optic cable systems carry a large portion of our traffic to and from the contiguous lower 48 states. If a failure occurs and we are not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services we offer to our customers could be interrupted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nManaged IT Services\nOur expansion into managed IT services may not be achieved as planned which could impact our ability to grow revenue.\nWe are expanding our business to provide more managed IT services along with our traditional telecom services. The delivery of professional services is not without risk, and it is possible that we may fail to execute on one or more managed IT service projects exposing the company to legal claims and reputational risk.\nPhysical Infrastructure\nWe may not be able to invest sufficiently in our underlying physical infrastructure, including buildings, fleet and related equipment.\nMuch of the Company\u2019s underlying physical infrastructure, including buildings, fleet vehicles and related systems and equipment, has been in service for an extended period of time. We may not be able to adequately fund the maintenance and replacement of this infrastructure which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s operations, including the provision of service to its customers.\nIntellectual Property\nThird parties may claim that the Company is infringing upon their intellectual property, and the Company could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products.\nAlthough the Company does not believe that any of its products or services infringe upon the valid intellectual property rights of third parties, the Company may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of its technology, products or services. Any litigation growing out of third-party patents or other intellectual property claims could be costly and time consuming and could divert the Company\u2019s management and key personnel from its business operations. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks. Resolution of claims of intellectual property infringement might also require the Company to enter into costly license agreements. Likewise, the Company may not be able to obtain license agreements on acceptable terms. The Company also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain of its products. Further, the Company often relies on licenses of third-party intellectual property for its businesses. The Company cannot ensure these licenses will be available in the future on favorable terms or at all. If any of these risks materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nSecurity Breaches\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information or damage our reputation. Any such failure also could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, the security of our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code, and other events that could have a security impact. Additionally, breaches of security may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having authorized or unauthorized access to confidential or other information. If one or more such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our information or our customers\u2019 information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us.\nWith regard to the physical infrastructure that supports our operations, we have taken measures to implement backup systems and other safeguards, but our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any disruption to that infrastructure. Such disruptions could involve electrical, communications, internet, transportation or other services used by us or third parties with whom we conduct business. The costs associated with such disruptions, including any loss of business, could have a significant adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nAny of these operational and security risks could lead to significant and negative consequences, including reputational harm as well as loss of customers and business opportunities, which in turn could have a significant adverse effect on our businesses, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nCyber-attacks may damage our networks or breach customer and other proprietary data, leading to service disruption, harm to reputation, loss of customers, and litigation over privacy violations.\nAll industries that rely on technology in customer interactions are increasingly at risk for cyber-attacks. A cyber-attack could be levied against our network, causing disruption of operations and service, requiring implementation of greater network security measures, and resulting in lost revenue due to lost service. A cyber-attack could also be targeted to infiltrate customer proprietary and other data, breaching customer privacy, resulting in misuse of customer information and other data, and possibly leading to litigation over privacy breaches and causing harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. In the event of a cyber-attack, Company insiders could utilize their knowledge of such an attack in trading the Company\u2019s publicly traded shares. We rely on a variety of procedures to guard against cyber-attacks, and to take appropriate actions in the event of a cyber-attack, but the frequency of threats from these attacks is growing globally and the risk to us is also growing.\nPension Plans\nWe may incur substantial and unexpected liabilities arising out of our pension plans.\nOur pension plans could result in substantial liabilities on our balance sheet. These plans and activities have and will generate substantial cash requirements for us, and these requirements may increase beyond our expectations in future years based on changing market conditions. The difference between projected plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the plans, is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, returns on investment and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. In the future, we may be required to make additional contributions to our defined benefit plan. Plan liabilities may impair our liquidity, have an unfavorable impact on our ability to obtain financing and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors who do not have such liabilities and cash requirements.\nOur most significant pension plan is the AEPF in which we participate on behalf of substantially all of our employees in Alaska. The AEPF is a multi-employer pension plan to which we make fixed, per employee, contributions through our collective bargaining agreement with the IBEW, which covers our IBEW represented workforce, and a special agreement, which covers most of our non-represented workforce. Because our contribution requirements are fixed, we cannot easily adjust our annual plan contributions to address our own financial circumstances. Currently, this plan is not fully funded, which means we may be subject to increased contribution obligations, penalties, and ultimately, we could incur a contingent withdrawal liability should we choose to withdraw from the AEPF for economic reasons. Our contingent withdrawal liability is an amount based on our pro-rata share among AEPF participants of the value of the funding shortfall. This contingent liability becomes due and payable by us if we terminate our participation in the AEPF. Moreover, if another participant in the AEPF goes bankrupt, we would become liable for a pro-rata share of the bankrupt participant\u2019s vested, but unpaid, liability for accrued benefits for that participant\u2019s employees. This could result in a substantial unexpected contribution requirement and making such a contribution could have a material adverse effect on our cash position and other financial results. These sources of potential liability are difficult to predict.\nGiven the complexity of pension-related matters we may not, in every instance, be in full compliance with applicable requirements.\nKey Members of Senior Management\nWe depend on key members of our senior management team; our performance could be adversely impacted if they depart and we cannot find suitable replacements.\nOur success depends largely on the skills, experience and performance of key members of our senior management team as well as our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified management and technical personnel. There is competition for qualified personnel in our industry and we may not be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business. Our remote location also presents a challenge to us in attracting new talent. If we lose one or more of our key employees, our ability to successfully implement our business plan could be materially adversely affected. We do not maintain any \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on any of our personnel.\nFuture Acquisitions\nFuture acquisitions could result in operating and financial difficulties.\nOur future growth may depend, in part, on acquisitions. To the extent that we grow through acquisitions, we will face the operational and financial risks that commonly accompany that strategy. We would also face operational risks, such as failing to assimilate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses, disrupting their ongoing businesses, increasing the complexity of our business, and impairing management resources and management\u2019s relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in their ownership and management. Further, the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, as well as the integration of an acquired business, may divert management time and other resources. Some acquisitions may not be successful, and their performance may result in the impairment of their carrying value.\nVolatility Risks Related to our Common Stock\nContinued volatility in the price of our common stock could negatively affect us and our stockholders.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been impacted by factors, many of which are beyond our control, including actual or anticipated variations in quarterly financial results, changes in financial expectations by securities analysts and announcements by our current and future competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments. In addition, our financial results in the future may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. Broad market and industry factors could also negatively affect the price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance. Future volatility in our stock price could materially adversely affect the trading market and prices for our common stock as well as our ability to issue additional securities or to secure additional financing.\nLocation Specific Risk\nWe operate in remote areas subject to geologic instability and other natural events which could negatively impact our operations.\nMany of our operations are located in areas that are prone to earthquakes, fires, and other natural disturbances. Many of these areas have limited emergency response assets and may be difficult to reach in an emergency situation. Should an event occur, it could be weeks or longer before remediation efforts could be implemented, if they could be implemented at all. The scope and risk of such an event occurring is difficult to gauge.\nPublic Health Issues\nA major public health issue, such as an epidemic or pandemic, could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nOur operations, including the provision of services and products to our customers and maintenance of the supporting infrastructure, rely on products, resources and our employees inside and outside the state of Alaska. A major public health issue, such as an epidemic or pandemic, could disrupt the timely receipt of those products and resources, the productivity of our employees, our provision of products and services to our customers and negatively affect overall economic conditions.\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not be effective, which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, and irrespective of the existence of material weaknesses, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that such controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate. Any of these circumstances could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable.", "PERMNO": 87373, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "ALSK"}
