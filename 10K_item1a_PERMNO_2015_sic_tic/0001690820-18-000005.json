{"cik": "1690820", "company": "CARVANA CO.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-06", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nDescribed below are certain risks to our business and the industry in which we operate. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the financial and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. As a result, our future results could differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of our future financial performance, and the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nWe have not been profitable since our inception in 2012 and had an accumulated loss of approximately $316.9 million as of December 31, 2017. We incurred net losses $36.8 million, $93.1 million and $164.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. We expect to make significant investments to further develop and expand our business and these investments may not result in increased revenue or growth on a timely basis or at all. In addition, as a public company, we have and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. As a result of these increased expenditures, we will have to generate and sustain increased revenue to achieve and maintain profitability.\nWe expect to continue to incur losses as we invest in and strive to grow our business. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including slowing demand for used cars and our related products and services, increasing competition, weakness in the automotive retail industry generally, a decline in global financial conditions that negatively impacts economic activity and employment, as well as other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays in generating revenue or profitability. If our rate of generating revenue slows, we may not be able to reduce costs in a timely manner because many of our costs are fixed. In addition, if we reduce variable costs to respond to losses, this may limit our ability to acquire customers and grow our revenues. Accordingly, we may not achieve or maintain profitability and we may continue to incur significant losses in the future.\nOur recent, rapid growth may not be indicative of our future growth and, if we continue to grow rapidly, we may not be able to manage our growth effectively.\nOur revenue grew from $130.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $365.1 million and $858.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, respectively. We expect that, in the future, even if our revenue increases, our rate of growth may decline. In any event, we will not be able to grow as fast or at all if we do not:\n\u2022increase the number of unique visitors to our website and the number of customers;\n\u2022further improve the quality of our product offering, features and complementary products and services, and introduce high quality new products, services and features;\n\u2022introduce additional third-party products and services; or\n\u2022acquire sufficient appropriate inventory at an attractive cost and high quality to meet the increasing demand for our vehicles.\n\u2022There can be no assurance that we will meet these objectives. We expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on:\n\u2022marketing and advertising, including an increase to our television advertising expenditures;\n\u2022expansion of our vehicle inventory; and\n\u2022general administration, including legal, accounting and other compliance expenses related to being a public company.\nOur historical rapid growth has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial resources. We have experienced significant growth in the number of users of our platform as well as the amount of data that we analyze. We have hired and expect to continue hiring additional personnel to support our rapid growth. Our organizational structure is becoming more complex as we add staff, and we will need to improve our operational, financial and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures. We will require significant capital expenditures and the allocation of valuable management resources to grow and change in these areas without undermining our corporate culture of rapid innovation, teamwork and attention to the car-buying experience for the consumer. If we cannot manage our growth effectively to maintain the quality and efficiency of our customers\u2019 car-buying experience and the quality of the vehicles we sell, our business could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business has grown rapidly as additional customers have purchased used cars and complementary products and services through our platform. However, our business is relatively new and has operated at substantial scale for only a limited period of time. Given this limited history, it is difficult to predict whether we will be able to maintain or grow our business. We also expect that our business will evolve in ways that may be difficult to predict. For example, over time our investments that are intended to drive new customer traffic to our website may be less productive than expected. In the event of this or any other adverse developments, our continued success will depend on our ability to successfully adjust our strategy to meet changing market dynamics. If we are unable to do so, our business could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur failure to maintain a reputation of integrity and to otherwise maintain and enhance our customer service quality and brand could adversely affect our business, sales and results of operations.\nOur business model is based on our ability to provide customers with a transparent and simplified solution to car buying that will save them time and money. Accordingly, our ability to deliver that solution at high quality and our reputation as a company of integrity are critical to our success. If we fail to maintain the high standards on which our reputation is built, or if an event occurs that damages this reputation, it could adversely affect consumer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. Even the perception of a decrease in the quality of our customer service or brand could impact results. Our high rate of growth makes maintaining our customer experience quality a particularly difficult challenge.\nComplaints or negative publicity about our business practices, marketing and advertising campaigns, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the integrity of the data that we provide to users, data privacy and security issues, and other aspects of our business, especially on blogs and social media websites, and irrespective of their validity, could diminish customer confidence in our platform and adversely affect our brand. The growing use of social media increases the speed with which information and opinions can be shared and thus the speed with which reputation can be affected. If we fail to correct or mitigate misinformation or negative information about us, the vehicles we offer to sell or purchase, our customer experience, or any aspect of our brand, including information spread through social media or traditional media channels, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and the risk of your investment.\nWe launched our first market in 2013 and do not have a long history operating as a commercial company. In addition, we have only operated independently of DriveTime since November 1, 2014 and, following our spinoff from DriveTime, we remained dependent on DriveTime for a number of important operations, including locations for certain of our inspection and reconditioning centers (\u201cIRCs\u201d), vehicle inventory purchasing and a number of administrative services. We continue to utilize DriveTime for certain services. Due to this and other factors, our operating results are not predictable and our historical results may not be indicative of our future results. In order for our revenues to continue to increase, we need to successfully enter new markets, acquire more customers and expand our brand awareness. The foregoing may not happen at all or may not happen as quickly as we expect. Our failure to expand our brand awareness, successfully enter new markets, acquire new customers and gain repeat customers would harm our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe may experience seasonal and other fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, which may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nWe expect our quarterly results of operations, including our revenue, gross profit and profitability, if any, and cash flow to vary significantly in the future based in part on, among other things, consumers\u2019 car-buying patterns. Used vehicle sales exhibit seasonality with sales peaking late in the first calendar quarter and diminishing through the rest of the year, with the lowest relative level of vehicle sales expected to occur in the fourth calendar quarter. Due to our rapid growth, our sales patterns to date have not reflected the general seasonality of the used vehicle industry, but we expect this to change once our business and markets mature. Used vehicle prices also exhibit seasonality, with used vehicles depreciating at a faster rate in the last two quarters of each year and a slower rate in the first two quarters of each year. Historically, this has led our gross profit per unit to be higher on average in the first half of the year than in the second half of the year. Other factors that may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate include, without limitation:\n\u2022our ability to attract new customers;\n\u2022changes in the competitive dynamics of our industry;\n\u2022the regulatory environment;\n\u2022expenses associated with unforeseen quality issues and manufacturer recalls; and\n\u2022litigation or other claims against us.\nIn addition, a significant portion of our expenses are fixed and do not vary proportionately with fluctuations in revenues. Accordingly, our results in any quarter may not indicate the results we may achieve in any subsequent quarter or for the full year, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful.\nThrough shared service and other agreements that were not negotiated at arm\u2019s length, we historically benefited from DriveTime\u2019s expertise and economies of scale, and continue to utilize DriveTime and its affiliates for certain services and processes and as a lender to us.\nWe were incubated by and benefited from our relationship and a series of arrangements with DriveTime that were not negotiated at arm\u2019s length, as DriveTime is controlled by our controlling shareholder who is also the father of our Chief Executive Officer. Currently, many services that DriveTime historically provided to us (including certain accounting, finance, legal, human resources, payroll and benefits, information technology, real estate and inventory purchasing) are now provided by alternative vendors or have been brought in-house. Consequently, certain of our historical costs may not accurately reflect our future costs to the extent that DriveTime no longer provides us with such services or refuses to continue doing so at currently contracted-for prices.\nFor example, DriveTime built our IRCs in Georgia, Texas, and New Jersey and now leases them to us. Verde Investments, Inc. (\"Verde\"), an affiliate of DriveTime, leases to us our Arizona IRC. If we are unable to time-efficiently and cost-effectively construct or acquire additional IRCs in the future, our production capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy customer demand. In addition, we lease most of our logistics hubs from DriveTime. If we cannot similarly lease space for logistics hubs in our future\nmarkets from DriveTime, we may not be able to expand into new markets as quickly as we have historically and we may incur additional costs in such expansion.\nWe continue to engage DriveTime, its affiliates, and other entities controlled by our controlling shareholder to provide us with certain services, including the administration of VSCs, GAP waiver coverage, and other related products sold to our customers. We also continue to utilize DriveTime for certain information technology and tax systems and services. For example, we rely on DriveTime\u2019s inventory management system and accounting system to support our revenue recognition process. Should DriveTime fail to adequately perform any of these services or maintain these systems, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, DriveTime has in the past and may in the future purchase automotive finance receivables from us.\nBefore and after we sell automotive receivables originated by us, DriveTime performs ongoing servicing and collections. If DriveTime is unwilling to enter into servicing arrangements for our future auto receivable facilities on terms or at prices consistent with their historical prices or at all, our ability to sell such receivables may be adversely affected. If DriveTime refuses to continue servicing and collecting on automotive finance receivables originated by us before we sell them to third parties, our ability to adequately prepare such receivables for sale may be adversely affected.\nIn the future, we may continue to opportunistically engage with DriveTime in various transactions.\nOur results of operations and financial condition are subject to management\u2019s accounting judgments, estimates, and changes in accounting policies.\nThe preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. If these estimates or assumptions are incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We have identified several accounting policies as being \u201ccritical\u201d to the fair presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they involve major aspects of our business and require us to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. These policies are described in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe implementation of new accounting requirements or other changes to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition.\nWe participate in a highly competitive industry; pressure from existing and new companies may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe face significant competition from companies that provide listings, information, lead generation, and car-buying services designed to reach consumers and enable dealers to reach these consumers.\nOur current and future competitors may include:\n\u2022traditional used car dealerships that could increase investment in technology and infrastructure to compete directly with our online model;\n\u2022Internet and online automotive sites that could change their models to directly compete with us, such as Google, Amazon, AutoTrader.com, eBay Motors, Edmunds.com, KBB.com, Autobytel.com, TrueCar.com, CarGurus.com, and Cars.com;\n\u2022providers of offline, membership-based car-buying services such as the Costco Auto Program;\n\u2022used-car dealers or marketplaces with eCommerce business or online platforms such as Vroom and Shift; and\n\u2022automobile manufacturers such as General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen that could change their sales models through technology and infrastructure investments.\nWe also expect that new competitors will continue to enter the online and traditional automotive retail industry with competing brands, business models, products, and services, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue, business and financial results. For example, traditional car dealerships could transition their selling efforts to the Internet, allowing them to sell cars across state lines and compete directly with our online offering and no-negotiating pricing model. There can be no assurance we will not experience competition from DriveTime, the company from which we were spun off and with which we currently have a number of business relationships. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that DriveTime will enter into any new agreements or arrangements with us or extend or renew existing agreements or arrangements on the same or similar terms, if at all. Furthermore, we have a cross-license agreement with DriveTime pursuant to which DriveTime has obtained limited licenses to some of our intellectual property. Additionally, existing eCommerce businesses, such as Amazon, could directly enter the online used car market. Some of these companies have significantly greater resources than we do and may be able to provide customers access to a greater inventory of vehicles at lower prices while delivering a competitive online experience.\nOur competitors may also develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future business model, products and services less competitive, unmarketable or obsolete. For example, technology is currently being developed to produce automated, driverless vehicles that could reduce the demand for, or replace, traditional cars including the used vehicles that we sell. Additionally, car rideshare services, such as Uber and Lyft, are becoming increasingly popular as a means of transportation and may decrease consumer demand for the used cars we sell, particularly as urbanization increases.\nFurthermore, new technologies such as autonomous driving software have the potential to change the dynamics of car ownership in the future. In addition, if our competitors develop business models, products or services with similar or superior functionality to our solutions, it may adversely impact our business.\nOur competitors may also impede our ability to reach consumers or commence operations in certain jurisdictions. For example, our competitors may increase their search engine optimization efforts and outbid us for search terms on various search engines. Additionally, our competitors could use their political influence and increase lobbying efforts to encourage new regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would prevent us from operating in certain jurisdictions.\nOur current and potential competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have, and the ability to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and support of their products and services. Additionally, they may have more extensive automotive industry relationships, longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly with new technologies and to undertake more extensive marketing or promotional campaigns. If we are unable to compete with these companies, the demand for our used cars, products and services could substantially decline.\nPrivate plaintiffs and federal, state and local regulatory and law enforcement authorities continue to scrutinize advertising, sales, financing and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of used vehicles. If, as a result, other automotive retailers adopt more transparent, consumer-oriented business practices, our differentiation versus those retailers could be reduced.\nIn addition, if one or more of our competitors, or DriveTime, were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future third-party data providers, technology partners, or other parties with whom we have relationships, thereby limiting our ability to develop, improve and promote our solutions. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and competitive pressures may harm our revenue, business and financial results.\nOur business is sensitive to changes in the prices of new and used vehicles.\nAny significant changes in retail prices for new or used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. For example, if retail prices for used vehicles rise relative to retail prices for new vehicles, it could make buying a new vehicle more attractive to our customers than buying a used vehicle, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could result in reduced used-car sales and lower revenue. Additionally, manufacturer incentives could contribute to narrowing the price gap between new and used vehicles. Used vehicle prices may also decline due to an increased number of new vehicle lease returns over the next several years. While lower used vehicle prices reduce our cost of acquiring new inventory, lower prices could also lead to reductions in the value of inventory we currently hold, which could have a negative impact on gross profit. Furthermore, any significant changes in wholesale prices for used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by reducing wholesale margins.\nOur business is dependent upon access to desirable vehicle inventory. Obstacles to acquiring attractive inventory, whether because of supply, competition, or other factors, may have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nWe acquire cars for sale through numerous sources, including from wholesale auctions and directly from consumers. There can be no assurance that the supply of desirable used vehicles will be sufficient to meet our needs. A reduction in the availability of or access to sources of inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we evaluate tens of thousands of potential cars daily using a proprietary algorithm to predict mechanical soundness, consumer desirability and relative value as prospective inventory. If we fail to adjust appraisal offers to stay in line with broader market trade-in offer trends or fail to recognize those trends, it could adversely affect our ability to acquire inventory. Our ability to source vehicles through our appraisal process could also be affected by competition, both from new and used car dealers directly and through third-party websites driving appraisal traffic to those dealers. In addition, we remain dependent on third parties to sell us used vehicles, and there can be no assurance of an adequate supply of such vehicles on terms that are attractive to us.\nOur business is dependent upon our ability to expeditiously sell inventory. Failure to expeditiously sell our inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nOur purchases of used vehicles are based in large part on projected demand. If actual sales are materially less than our forecasts, we would experience an over-supply of used-vehicle inventory. An over-supply of used vehicle inventory will generally cause downward pressure on our product sales prices and margins and increase our average days to sale.\nUsed-vehicle inventory has typically represented a significant portion of our total assets. Having such a large portion of our total assets in the form of used-vehicle inventory for an extended period of time subjects us to depreciation and other risks that affect our results of operations. Accordingly, if we have excess inventory or our average days to sale increases, we may be unable to liquidate such inventory at prices that allow us to meet margin targets or to recover our costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur ability to sell automotive finance receivables and generate gains on sales of these finance receivables may decline in the future; any material reduction could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe provide financing to customers and typically sell the receivables related to the financing contract to third-party investors or, in limited instances, DriveTime. For example, we entered into agreements in November 2017 pursuant to which third-party purchasers increased their commitment, agreeing to purchase an additional aggregate $1.4 billion of automotive finance receivables we originate. We may exceed our capacity to sell automotive finance receivables under these agreements prior to the end of the fourth quarter of 2018. As we use the available capacity under each agreement, we plan to enter into new arrangements to sell additional vehicle finance receivables. If we reach our capacity under these or future arrangements, and we cannot replace them with new arrangements, we may be unable to generate adequate liquidity and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, there can be no assurance that our relationships with the investors who purchase these receivables will continue in the future, that such investors will renew our agreements with them when they expire, or that they will not terminate them due to a breach by us of our agreements with them or otherwise. If they cease to purchase these receivables, it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue originating finance receivables and adversely impact our operating results. Furthermore, we would be subject to the risk that some of these receivables are not paid when due and we are forced to incur unexpected asset write-offs and bad-debt expense.\nWe depend on the sale of automotive finance receivables for a substantial portion of our gross profit.\nIn connection with the sale of used cars, many of our customers use our financing services to finance a portion of the purchase price of their vehicle. The prices we are able to charge for finance receivables that we sell are based on a variety of factors, including the terms and credit risk associated with the automotive finance receivables, the relationship between the interest rates we quoted the customer at the time they priced their financing and market interest rates at the time we sell the\nfinance receivables, the historical credit performance of the finance receivables we sell, investor demand and other factors. If these variables or others were to change, we might be required to reduce our sale prices on finance receivables, sell fewer of them, or both, which could reduce our gains on sales of finance receivables. Any material reduction in our interest rate spread or gains on sale of finance receivables could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, customers may elect to finance their car purchases through other parties who may be able to offer more attractive terms, in which case we would lose a source of a significant portion of our historical gross profit.\nOur ability to resell automotive finance receivables is dependent on our ability to originate desirable finance receivables. If customers or third parties provide us incorrect or fraudulent data, we may offer credit terms that do not align with customers\u2019 credit profiles, and our operating results may be harmed.\nWe offer financing to our customers to facilitate their purchases of used vehicles. The terms of the financing we offer are dependent in part on our assessment of such customers\u2019 credit-worthiness, which is based on data gathered from customers and third parties. If the information we rely on is inaccurate or fraudulent, we may offer inappropriate terms to our customers, resulting in originating receivables that we are unable to collect or sell because they are based on inaccurate credit profiles. Originating a material amount of receivables with inaccurate or fraudulent credit profiles could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe success of our business relies heavily on our marketing and branding efforts, and these efforts may not be successful.\nWe believe that an important component of our growth will be the growth of visitors to our website. Because we are a consumer brand, we rely heavily on marketing and advertising to increase brand visibility with potential customers. We currently advertise through a blend of brand and direct advertising channels with the goal of increasing the strength, recognition and trust in the Carvana brand and driving more unique visitors to our website. We recorded expenses of approximately $10.8 million, $27.0 million and $55.7 million on advertising in the years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nOur business model relies on our ability to scale rapidly and to decrease incremental customer acquisition costs as we grow. If we are unable to recover our marketing costs through increases in customer traffic and in the number of transactions by users of our platform, if our advertising partners refuse to customize their products and services to accommodate our business model, if our advertising partners refuse to work with us at competitive rates or at all, or if our broad marketing campaigns are not successful or are terminated, it could have a material adverse effect on our growth, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on Internet search engines, vehicle listings sites and social networking sites to help drive traffic to our website, and if we fail to appear prominently in the search results or fail to drive traffic through paid advertising, our traffic would decline and our business would be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on Internet search engines, such as Google, Bing and Yahoo!, vehicle listings sites and social networking sites such as Facebook to drive traffic to our website. Our ability to maintain and increase the number of visitors directed to our website is not entirely within our control. Our competitors may increase their search engine optimization efforts and outbid us for placement on various vehicle listings sites or search terms on various search engines, resulting in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than ours. Additionally, Internet search engines could revise their methodologies in a way that would adversely affect our search result rankings. If Internet search engines modify their search algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, if vehicle listings sites refuse to display any or all of our inventory in certain geographic markets, or if our competitors\u2019 efforts are more successful than ours, overall growth in our customer base could slow or our customer base could decline. Internet search engine providers could provide automotive dealer and pricing information directly in search results, align with our competitors or choose to develop competing services. Our website has experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our website through Internet search engines, vehicle listings sites, or social networking sites could harm our business and operating results.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations. Our sale and purchase of used vehicles and related activities, including the sale of complementary products and services, are subject to state and local licensing requirements, federal and state laws regulating advertising of vehicles and related products and services, state laws related to title and registration and state laws regulating the sale of vehicles and related products and services. The applicability of these regulatory and legal compliance obligations is dependent on the evolving interpretations of these laws and regulations and how our operations are, or are not, subject to them. The financing we offer to customers is subject to federal and state laws regulating the provision of consumer finance. Our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety. In addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to our business, we are also subject to laws and regulations affecting public companies, including securities laws and NYSE listing rules. The violation of any of these laws or regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties or in a cease-and-desist order against our business operations, any of which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenses and other costs to comply with these laws and regulations.\nOur logistics operations, which we depend on to transport vehicles from auctions to our IRCs, then to our logistics hubs, and finally to our vending machines, fulfillment centers or directly to customers, are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the DOT and individual states through which our vehicles travel, which have broad administrative powers with respect to our logistics operations. Vehicle dimensions, driver alcohol and drug testing and driver hours of service are also subject to both federal and state regulation. More restrictive limitations on vehicle weight and size, trailer length and configuration, methods of measurement, driver qualifications or driver hours of service would increase our costs, and if we are unable to pass these cost increases on to our customers, our operating expenses may increase and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. If we fail to comply with the DOT regulations or regulations become more stringent, we could be subject to increased inspections, audits or compliance burdens. Regulatory authorities could take remedial action including imposing fines or shutting down our operations. If any of these events occur, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nOur sale of used vehicles, related products and services and finance receivables is subject to the state and local licensing requirements of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Regulators of jurisdictions where our customers reside but in which we do not have a dealer or financing license could require that we obtain a license or otherwise comply with various state regulations. Despite our belief that we are not subject to the licensing requirements of those jurisdictions, regulators may seek to impose punitive fines for operating without a license or demand we seek a license in those jurisdictions, any of which may inhibit our ability to do business in those jurisdictions, increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe foregoing description of laws and regulations to which we are or may be subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations is subject to evolving interpretations and continuous change.\nChanges in the laws and regulations to which our business and industry is subject could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nRecent federal legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms may result in an increase in expenses or a decrease in revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) regulates, among other things, the provision of consumer financing. The Dodd-Frank Act established a new consumer financial protection agency, the CFPB, with broad regulatory powers. The CFPB is responsible for administering and enforcing laws and regulations related to consumer financial products and services. The evolving regulatory environment in the wake of the 2016 Presidential election, the Dodd-Frank Act and the creation of the CFPB may increase the cost of regulatory compliance or result in changes to business practices that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as it is phased in over time, significantly affects the provision of health care services and will increase the costs we incur to provide our employees with health coverage. Current federal labor\npolicy could lead to increased unionization efforts, which could increase labor costs, disrupt facility operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nThe enactment of new laws and regulations or the interpretation of existing laws and regulations in an unfavorable way may affect the operation of our business, directly or indirectly, which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs, civil or criminal penalties, including fines, adverse publicity, decreased revenues and increased expenses.\nIf we fail to comply with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, we may face significant damages, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe utilize telephone calls and text messaging as a means of responding to and marketing to customers interested in purchasing, trading in, selling and/or financing vehicles and related products and services. We generate leads from our website by prompting potential customers to provide their phone numbers so that we can contact them in response to their interest in financing terms, trading in a vehicle or purchasing a specific vehicle. We also pay third parties for leads. A portion of our revenue comes from purchases, sales, and financing that involves a call or text made by our internal call centers or third-party vendors we engage to reach out to these potential customers.\nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cTCPA\u201d), as interpreted and implemented by the FCC and U.S. courts imposes significant restrictions on the use of telephone calls and text messages to residential and mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication when prior consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained. Violations of the TCPA may be enforced by the FCC or by individuals through litigation, including class actions. Statutory penalties for TCPA violations range from $500 to $1,500 per violation, which has been interpreted to mean per phone call.\nWhile we have implemented processes and procedures to comply with the TCPA, if we or the third parties on which we rely for data fail to adhere to or successfully implement appropriate processes and procedures in response to existing or future regulations, it could result in legal and monetary liability, fines, penalties, or damage to our reputation in the marketplace, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, any changes to the TCPA, its interpretation, or enforcement of it by the government or private parties that further restrict the way we contact and communicate with our potential customers or generate leads could adversely affect our ability to attract customers and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet and eCommerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and eCommerce. Existing and future regulations and laws could impede the growth of the Internet, eCommerce or mobile commerce. These regulations and laws may involve taxes, privacy, data security, anti-spam, pricing, content protection, electronic contracts and communications, mobile communications, consumer protection, information reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our services and the design and operation of websites. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes and consumer privacy apply to the Internet as the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the Internet or eCommerce. Unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for used cars and complementary products and services and increase our cost of doing business.\nOur ability to grow our complementary product and service offerings may be limited, which could negatively impact our growth rate, revenues and financial performance.\nIf we introduce new or expand existing offerings for our platform, such as services or products involving new cars, vehicle trade-ins, financing, insurance, deficiency waivers, customized accessories, leasing or maintenance, we may incur losses or otherwise fail to enter these markets successfully. Our expansion into these markets will place us in competitive and regulatory environments with which we are unfamiliar and involve various risks, including the need to invest significant resources and the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved for several years, if at all. In attempting to establish new service or product offerings, we expect to incur significant expenses and face various other challenges, such as expanding our customer advocate and management personnel to cover these markets and complying with complicated regulations that apply to these markets. In addition, we may not successfully demonstrate the value of these complementary products and services to consumers, and failure to do so would compromise our ability to successfully expand into these additional revenue streams. Any of these risks, if realized, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we do not adequately address our customers\u2019 shift to mobile device technology, operating results could be harmed and our growth could be negatively affected.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to provide adequate functionality for visitors who use mobile devices to shop for used cars and the number of transactions with us that are completed by those users. In the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 52.2% of unique visitors to our website were attributable to mobile devices; in the year ended December 31, 2016, this figure grew to approximately 54.1%, and in the year ended December 31, 2017, this figure grew to approximately 59.0%. The shift to mobile technology by our users may harm our business in the following ways:\n\u2022customers visiting our website from a mobile device may not accept mobile technology as a viable long-term platform to buy or sell a vehicle. This may occur for a number of reasons, including our ability to provide the same level of website functionality to a mobile device that we provide on a desktop computer, the actual or perceived lack of security of information on a mobile device and possible disruptions of service or connectivity;\n\u2022we may not continue to innovate and introduce enhanced products that can be suitably conveyed on mobile platforms;\n\u2022consumers using mobile devices may believe that our competitors offer superior products and features based in part on our inability to provide sufficient website functionality to convince a mobile device user to transact with us; or\n\u2022regulations related to consumer finance disclosures, including the Truth in Lending Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, may be interpreted, in the context of mobile devices, in a manner which could expose us to legal liability in the event we are found to have violated applicable laws.\nIf we do not develop suitable functionality for users who visit our website using a mobile device, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nOur business is subject to risks related to the larger automotive ecosystem, including consumer demand, global supply chain challenges and other macroeconomic issues.\nDecreases in consumer demand could adversely affect the market for used vehicles and, as a result, reduce the number of consumers using our platform. Consumer purchases of new and used vehicles generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. For example, the number of new vehicle sales in the United States decreased from approximately 16.4 million in 2007 to approximately 10.6 million in 2009, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Purchases of new and used vehicles are typically discretionary for consumers and have been, and may continue to be, affected by negative trends in the economy and other factors, including rising interest rates, the cost of energy and gasoline, the availability and cost of credit, reductions in business and consumer confidence, stock market volatility, increased regulation and increased unemployment. Increased environmental regulation has made, and may in the future make, used cars more expensive and less desirable for consumers. In addition, our business may be negatively affected by challenges to the larger automotive ecosystem, including urbanization, global supply chain challenges and other macroeconomic issues. For example, car rideshare services, such as Uber and Lyft, are becoming increasingly popular as a means of transportation and may decrease consumer demand for the used cars we sell, particularly as urbanization increases. Additionally, new technologies such as autonomous driving software have the potential to change the dynamics of car ownership in the future. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe current geographic concentration where we provide services creates an exposure to local economies, regional downturns or severe weather or catastrophic occurrences that may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of the date of this report, we currently conduct business through four IRCs located in Winder, Georgia, Blue Mound, Texas, Tolleson, Arizona and Delanco, New Jersey, managing fulfillment to 54 metropolitan areas across the Southeast, South Central, Midwest, Southwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions. We hold the significant majority of our inventory at these four locations. Our business is currently more susceptible to regional conditions than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors, and we are vulnerable to economic downturns in those regions. In addition, any unforeseen events or circumstances that negatively affect these areas could materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Changes in demographics and population or severe weather conditions and other catastrophic occurrences in areas in which we operate or\nfrom which we obtain inventory may materially adversely affect our results of operations. Such conditions may result in physical damage to our properties, loss of inventory, and delays in the delivery of vehicles to our logistics hubs, fulfillment centers, vending machines or to our customers.\nAny of these factors may disrupt our businesses and materially adversely affect our financial condition and result of operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully replicate our business model and achieve levels of success as we enter new markets.\nWe may require additional debt and equity capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances. If such capital is not available to us, our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances, including to increase our marketing expenditures to improve our brand awareness, build and maintain our inventory of quality used vehicles, develop new products or services (including vehicle financing services) or further improve existing products and services, enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. However, additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any debt financing that we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. Volatility in the credit markets may also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on agreements with third parties to finance our vehicle inventory purchases. If we fail to maintain adequate relationships with third parties to finance our vehicle inventory purchases, we may be unable to maintain sufficient inventory, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on agreements with third-party lenders to finance our vehicle inventory purchases. If we are unable to extend the agreements on favorable terms or at all, or if the agreements expire and are not renewed, our inventory supply may decline, resulting in fewer vehicles available for sale on our website. For example, our agreement with Ally matures in December 2018 and may be extended for an additional 364-day period at Ally\u2019s sole discretion. If we are unable to renew the facility with Ally or find a satisfactory replacement, whether because of our financial and operating performance or for other reasons, our ability to acquire inventory would be adversely affected. New funding arrangements may be at higher interest rates or other less favorable terms. These financing risks, in addition to rising interest rates and changes in market conditions, if realized could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe make certain representations concerning the automotive finance receivables we sell. If those representations are not correct, we could be required to repurchase the receivables. Any significant required repurchases could have an adverse effect upon our ability to operate and fund our business.\nWe generally seek to sell automotive finance receivables to third parties. If these receivables do not meet the specified representations, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, forced to repurchase these receivables. If we sell a significant amount of receivables that do not meet the predetermined representations, we may be required to use cash on hand or to obtain alternative financing in order to repurchase them. Any significant repurchases could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on our proprietary credit scoring model to forecast automotive finance receivable loss rates. If we are unable to effectively forecast loss rates, it may negatively impact our operating results.\nWe rely on our internally developed models to forecast loss rates of the automotive finance receivables we originate. If we rely on a model that fails to effectively forecast loss rates on receivables we originate, those receivables may suffer higher losses than expected. We generally seek to sell these receivables to third parties. If the receivables we sell to third parties\nexperience higher loss rates than forecasted, we may obtain less favorable pricing on the receivables we sell to those parties in the future and suffer reputational harm in the marketplace for the receivables we sell and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. We hold receivables we originate on our balance sheet until we sell them to third parties, and to the extent those receivables fail to perform during our holding period, they may become ineligible for sale. As a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on internal and external logistics to transport our vehicle inventory throughout our markets and the United States. Thus, we are subject to business risks and costs associated with the transportation industry. Many of these risks and costs are out of our control, and any of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on a combination of internal and external logistics to transport vehicles from auctions to our IRCs, then to our logistics hubs, and finally to our vending machines, fulfillment centers or directly to customers. As a result, we are exposed to risks associated with the transportation industry such as weather, traffic patterns, gasoline prices, recalls affecting our vehicle fleet, local and federal regulations, vehicular crashes, insufficient internal capacity, rising prices of external transportation vendors, fuel prices, taxes, license and registration fees, insurance premiums, self-insurance levels, difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified drivers, disruption of our technology systems, and increasing equipment and operational costs. Our failure to successfully manage our logistics and fulfillment process could cause a disruption in our inventory supply chain and distribution, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe face a variety of risks associated with the construction, financing and operation of our vending machines, fulfillment centers and inspection and reconditioning centers, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to obtain approvals, permits and licenses from state regulators and local municipalities to construct and operate our vending machines, fulfillment centers and IRCs. We may face delays in obtaining the requisite approvals, permits, financing, and licenses to construct and operate our vending machines and fulfillment centers or we may not be able to obtain them at all. If we encounter delays in obtaining or cannot obtain the requisite approvals, permits, financing, and licenses to construct and operate our vending machines, fulfillment centers and IRCs in desirable locations, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe lease and finance certain real estate on which we construct and operate some of our vending machines. Some landlords will have concerns leasing and some lenders will have concerns financing to a tenant with such a unique use due to potential difficulties finding a replacement tenant. Consequently, some landlords or lenders may offer unfavorable leasing or financing terms or may not be willing to lease or finance the sites we pursue. Similarly, sites we wish to purchase for the construction or operation of our vending machines may have similar constraints. If we are required to enter into inflexible or expensive leases, financing, or purchase agreements to construct and operate our vending machines our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe depend on one supplier to construct portions of our vending machines and to provide technical support and maintenance on our vending machines. If we are unable to maintain our relationship with our supplier, our supplier ceases to produce the vending machines, or our supplier is unable to effectively deliver our vending machine orders on timelines and at the price we have negotiated, and we are unable to contract with an alternative supplier, we may not be able to construct new vending machines or continue to operate existing vending machines and our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected. Additionally, the durability of our vending machines is unknown and we may be required to incur significant maintenance and other expenses to keep them operating properly. If we are required to incur significant expenses to maintain our vending machines our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe also rely on third-party vendors and suppliers to construct and operate portions of our IRCs. If we are unable to maintain our relationship with our third-party vendors and suppliers, such vendors and suppliers cease to provide the services we need, or such vendors and suppliers are unable to effectively deliver our services on timelines and at the price we have negotiated, and we are unable to contract with alternative vendors and suppliers, our ability to construct new IRCs or continue to operate existing IRCs and our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe may rely on agreements with third parties to finance certain vending machines and inspection and reconditioning centers. If we fail to create or maintain adequate relationships with third parties to finance such assets, we may be unable to construct and operate additional vending machines and inspection and reconditioning centers in the future, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe currently rely on agreements with third parties to finance certain vending machines, and may in the future rely on agreements with third parties to finance other real estate capital expenditures, including additional vending machines and inspection and reconditioning centers. If we are unable to enter into new financing agreements for such assets on favorable terms or at all, whether because of our financial and operating performance or for other reasons, our ability to construct and operate new real estate capital expenditures would be adversely affected. New funding arrangements may be at higher interest rates than historical real estate financing or other less favorable terms. These financing risks, in addition to rising interest rates and changes in market conditions, if realized could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use personal information and other data, and our actual or perceived failure to protect such information and data could damage our reputation and brand and harm our business and operating results.\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use personal information and other data provided by consumers. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to securely transmit such information. We expend significant resources to protect against security breaches and may need to expend more resources in the event we need to address problems caused by breaches. Any failure or perceived failure to maintain the security of personal and other data that is provided to us by consumers and vendors could harm our reputation and brand and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAdditionally, concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our business and operating results.\nThere are numerous federal, state and local laws regarding privacy and the collection, processing, storing, sharing, disclosing, using and protecting of personal information and other data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and which may be costly to comply with, inconsistent between jurisdictions or conflicting with other rules. We are also subject to specific contractual requirements contained in third-party agreements governing our use and protection of personal information and other data. We generally comply with industry standards and are subject to the terms of our privacy policies and the privacy- and security-related obligations to third parties. We strive to comply with applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection, to the extent possible. However, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in new ways or in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. New regulations could be enacted. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to consumers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of sensitive information, which may include personally identifiable information or other customer data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause consumers, vendors and receivable purchasers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if vendors, developers or other third parties that we work with violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put consumers\u2019, vendors\u2019 or receivables-purchasers\u2019 information at risk and could in turn harm our reputation, business and operating results.\nA significant disruption in service on our website could damage our reputation and result in a loss of consumers, which could harm our business, brand, operating results and financial condition.\nOur brand, reputation and ability to attract customers depend on the reliable performance of our website and the supporting systems, technology and infrastructure. We may experience significant interruptions to our systems in the future. Interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, programming or configuration errors, computer viruses, or physical or electronic break-ins, could affect the availability of our inventory on our website and prevent or inhibit the ability of customers to access our website. Problems with the reliability or security of our systems could harm our reputation, result in a loss of customers and result in additional costs.\nSubstantially all of the communications, network and computer hardware used to operate our website are located at co-location facilities. Although we have multiple locations, our systems are not fully redundant. In addition, we do not own or\ncontrol the operation of these facilities. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, acts of war, electronic and physical break-ins, computer viruses, earthquakes, and similar events. The occurrence of any of these events could damage our systems and hardware or could cause them to fail.\nProblems faced by our third-party web-hosting providers could adversely affect the experience of our customers. For example, our third-party web-hosting providers could close their facilities without adequate notice. Any financial difficulties, up to and including bankruptcy, faced by our third-party web-hosting providers or any of the service providers with whom they contract may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict. If our third-party web-hosting providers are unable to keep up with our growing capacity needs, our business could be harmed.\nAny errors, defects, disruptions, or other performance or reliability problems with our network operations could interrupt our customers\u2019 access to our inventory and our access to data that drives our inventory purchase operations as well as cause delays and additional expense in arranging access to new facilities and services, any of which could harm our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property, technology and confidential information could harm our business and operating results.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, technology and confidential information, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our business. For example, we have developed proprietary algorithms to price the vehicles we purchase and sell and the financing we offer customers. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect these algorithms and our other intellectual property, technology and confidential information. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property, technology and confidential information by requiring certain of our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements and certain third parties to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively grant all necessary rights to any inventions that may have been developed by the employees and consultants. In addition, these agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property or technology and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our website features, software and functionality or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary. Changes in the law or adverse court rulings may also negatively affect our ability to prevent others from using our technology.\nWe currently hold rights to the \u201ccarvana.com\u201d Internet domain name and various other related domain names. The regulation of domain names in the United States is subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars, or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may not be able to acquire or maintain all domain names that use the name Carvana or are otherwise important for our business.\nWe may be subject to claims asserting that our employees, consultants or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employees or claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nAlthough we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these individuals have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such individual\u2019s current or former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property may not be self-executing or the assignment agreement may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties or defend claims that they may bring against us to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nWe may in the future be subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly to defend and could harm our business and operating results.\nWe may from time to time face allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including from our competitors or non-practicing entities. We may be unaware of others\u2019 intellectual property rights that they claim cover some or all of our technology or services. Patent and other intellectual property litigation may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict and may require us to stop offering some features, purchase licenses, modify our products and features while we develop non-infringing substitutes, or pay significant settlement costs or compensation for damages.\nEven if these matters do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, the time and resources necessary to litigate or resolve them could harm our business, our operating results and our reputation.\nOur platform utilizes open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business.\nIn addition, we use open source software in our platform and expect to use open source software in the future. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by United States courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our platform. By the terms of certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software and to make our proprietary software available under open source licenses if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner. In the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, to re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies or otherwise to be limited in the licensing of our technologies, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our technologies and services. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated and could negatively affect our business and operating results.\nOur business is sensitive to conditions affecting automotive manufacturers, including manufacturer recalls.\nAdverse conditions affecting one or more automotive manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations and could impact the supply of vehicles. In addition, manufacturer recalls are a common occurrence that have accelerated in frequency and scope in recent years. Recalls and the increased regulatory scrutiny surrounding selling used vehicles with open safety recalls could adversely affect used vehicle sales or valuations, could cause us to temporarily remove vehicles from inventory, could cause us to sell affected vehicles at a loss, could force us to incur increased costs and could expose us to litigation and adverse publicity related to the sale of recalled vehicles, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party technology to complete critical business functions. If that technology fails to adequately serve our needs and we cannot find alternatives, it may negatively impact our operating results.\nWe rely on third-party technology for certain of our critical business functions, including customer identity verification for financing, transportation fleet telemetry, network infrastructure for hosting the website and inventory data, software libraries, development environments and tools, services to allow customers to digitally sign contracts, customer service call center management software, automation controls and software for our vending machines. If these technologies fail or we cannot maintain our relationships with the technology providers and we cannot find suitable alternatives, our financial condition and operation results may be adversely affected.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain, attract and integrate qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed.\nWe believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of our executives and employees. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. In addition, the loss of any of our key employees or senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Ernie Garcia, III, or our\nChief Financial Officer, Mark Jenkins, could materially adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and strategy, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all. Our executive officers and other employees are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. We may not be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention, and we have and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of becoming a public company.\nAs a public company, we face increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs related to operating as a public company. After the completion of our IPO, we became subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), the rules and regulations implemented by the SEC, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and the listing requirements of the NYSE, each of which imposes additional reporting and other obligations on public companies. As a public company, we are required to, among other things:\n\u2022prepare, file and distribute annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition;\n\u2022prepare, file and distribute proxy statements and other stockholder communications;\n\u2022expand the roles and duties of our Board and committees thereof and management;\n\u2022hire additional financial and accounting personnel and other experienced accounting and finance staff with the expertise to address complex accounting matters applicable to public companies;\n\u2022institute more comprehensive financial reporting and disclosure compliance procedures;\n\u2022involve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants to assist us with the activities listed above;\n\u2022enhance our investor relations function;\n\u2022establish new internal policies, including those relating to trading in our securities and disclosure controls and procedures;\n\u2022comply with the NYSE listing standards; and\n\u2022comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nThese rules and regulations and changes in laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, which have created uncertainty for public companies, have and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. Our investment in compliance with existing and evolving regulatory requirements has and will continue to result in increased administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to grow our business in response to the demands of consumers and other constituents within the automotive industry as well as competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may determine to do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses and technologies rather than through internal development. The\nidentification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. The risks we face in connection with acquisitions include:\n\u2022diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;\n\u2022coordination of technology, research and development and sales and marketing functions;\n\u2022transition of the acquired company\u2019s users to our website and mobile applications;\n\u2022retention of employees from the acquired company;\n\u2022cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n\u2022integration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems;\n\u2022the need to implement or improve controls, policies and procedures at a business that, prior to the acquisition, may have lacked effective controls, policies and procedures;\n\u2022potential write-offs of intangibles or other assets acquired in such transactions that may have an adverse effect our operating results;\n\u2022liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u2022litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, consumers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and otherwise harm our business. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, or the write-off of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. Also, the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions may not materialize. Any of these risks, if realized, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nDDFS Partnership LP may exercise influence over us.\nThe terms of the Class A Convertible Preferred Stock grant DDFS Partnership LP (\u201cDDFS\u201d) approval rights, through its ownership of the Class A Convertible Preferred Stock, with respect to our ability to issue pari passu or senior equity securities.\nAdditionally, in the event that dividends payable on the Class A Convertible Preferred Stock are in arrears for six or more quarterly periods, the terms of the Class A Convertible Preferred Stock grant holders of the Class A Convertible Preferred Stock the right to designate two directors to serve on our Board, which directors are elected by a separate class vote of the holders of Class A Convertible Preferred Stock.\nAny directors designated by DDFS would also be entitled to serve on committees of our Board, subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules. Notwithstanding the fact that all directors will be subject to fiduciary duties to us and to applicable law, the interests of any directors designated by DDFS may differ from the interests of our security holders as a whole or of our other directors.\nWe are, and may in the future be, subject to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. If the outcomes of these proceedings are adverse to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to various litigation matters from time to time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Legal claims could be asserted against us by individuals, either individually or\nthrough class actions, by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings or by other entities. These claims could be asserted under a variety of laws, including but not limited to consumer finance laws, consumer protection laws, intellectual property laws, privacy laws, labor and employment laws, securities laws, employee benefit laws, and tort laws. These actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs, injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties, including but not limited to suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business.\nErrors in our retail installment contracts with our customers may render them unenforceable or ineligible for sale. If we have already sold retail installment contracts with errors in them, we may be required to repurchase them.\nWe enter into purchase agreements, buyer\u2019s orders, retail installment contracts and other contracts with our customers that are generated automatically based upon information the customer enters into our website. The contracts are intended to comply with the applicable consumer lending and other commercial and legal requirements of the relevant jurisdiction in which the sale is made. We face the risk, however, that the auto-generated forms may inadvertently contain errors, omissions or otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations in a manner that would render such contracts unenforceable. For example, most jurisdictions impose a maximum interest rate cap that we can charge our customers. If we inadvertently or otherwise exceed the relevant cap, our retail installment contracts in such jurisdiction may be unenforceable, and in some instances, we may be required to pay damages or repay any financing charges previously collected. If a significant number of our retail installment contracts are rendered unenforceable, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe third parties who agree to buy our retail installment contracts require that we make certain representations about the enforceability or validity of those contracts. If the retail installment contracts we enter into with our customers and sell to third parties contain errors, we may be required to repurchase those contracts, which would materially and adversely affect our revenue from those contracts and may jeopardize our ability to sell contracts to those third parties in the future.\nWe may not be able to extend the durations of our sale-leaseback arrangements on similar terms or at all. If we are unable to extend the duration of a sale-leaseback arrangement on acceptable terms, we may be required to vacate properties that are subject to the sale-leaseback arrangement or, in certain instances, we may alternatively be required to purchase the facilities from the lessor.\nOn November 3, 2017, we entered into a Master Sale-Leaseback Agreement pursuant to which we may sell and lease back up to $75.0 million of our real property interests, including costs for construction improvements. At any time, we may elect to, and beginning November 2, 2019, the purchaser has the right to demand that, we repurchase one or more sold real property interests for an amount equal to the repurchase price provided in the applicable lease and any amounts due and owing under such lease.\nWe may not be able to extend the November 2, 2019 date in our Master Sale-Leaseback Agreement on similar terms or at all, and we may have insufficient funds or be unable to obtain financing to repurchase the properties pursuant to the terms of the agreement in the event the purchaser demands that we repurchase sold properties. If we are unable to extend the November 2, 2019 date in our Master Sale-Leaseback Agreement on acceptable terms or repurchase the properties subject to the agreement upon the purchaser\u2019s demand, we may be required to vacate such properties. The cost of vacating or repurchasing our real property subject to the agreement may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure\nOur principal asset is our indirect interest in Carvana Group, and, accordingly, we depend on distributions from Carvana Group to pay our taxes and expenses, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and dividends on our Class A Convertible Preferred Stock. Carvana Group\u2019s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions.\nWe are a holding company and have no material assets other than our indirect ownership of LLC Units of Carvana Group. As such, we have no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow, and our ability to pay our taxes and operating expenses or declare and pay dividends in the future, if any, depends on the financial results and cash flows of Carvana Group and its subsidiaries and distributions we receive from Carvana Group. There can be no assurance that our subsidiaries will\ngenerate sufficient cash flow to distribute funds to us or that applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including negative covenants in our debt instruments, will permit such distributions.\nCarvana Group is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income of Carvana Group is allocated to the LLC Unitholders, including Carvana Sub, our wholly owned subsidiary. Accordingly, we incur income taxes on our allocable share of any net taxable income of Carvana Group. Under the terms of the LLC Operating Agreement, Carvana Group is obligated to make tax distributions to LLC Unitholders, including us. We also accrue dividends under our Class A Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition to tax and dividend payments, we also incur expenses related to our operations, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Due to the uncertainty of various factors, we cannot estimate the likely tax benefits we realize as a result of LLC Unit exchanges, and the resulting amounts we are likely to pay out to LLC Unitholders pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement; however, we estimate that such payments may be substantial. We intend to cause Carvana Group to make cash distributions to the owners of LLC Units in an amount sufficient to (1) fund all or part of their tax obligations in respect of taxable income allocated to them, (2) fund all interest accruing on the Class A Convertible Preferred Stock and (3) cover our operating expenses, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nHowever, Carvana Group\u2019s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions, such as restrictions on distributions that would either violate any contract or agreement to which Carvana Group is then a party, including debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering Carvana Group insolvent. If we do not have sufficient funds to pay tax or other liabilities or to fund our operations, we may have to borrow funds, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and subject us to various restrictions imposed by any such lenders. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, such payments generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid. Nonpayment for a specified period, however, may constitute a breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement and therefore accelerate payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement, unless, generally, such nonpayment is due to a lack of sufficient funds. If we are unable to declare and pay the required dividends under the Class A Convertible Preferred Stock for six or more quarterly periods, the holders of the Class A Convertible Preferred Stock will have certain representation rights on our board. In addition, if Carvana Group does not have sufficient funds to make distributions, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends will also be restricted or impaired. See Item 1A \u201c- Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock.\u201d\nConflicts of interest could arise between our stockholders and the LLC Unitholders, which may impede business decisions that could benefit our stockholders.\nHolders of LLC Units have the right to consent to certain amendments to the operating agreement of the LLC, as well as to certain other matters, including the revaluation of partnership interests in Carvana Group. Holders of these voting rights may exercise them in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders. Circumstances may arise in the future when the interests of the LLC Unitholders conflict with the interests of our stockholders. As we control the LLC, we have certain obligations to the LLC Unitholders that may conflict with fiduciary duties our officers and directors owe to our stockholders. These conflicts may result in decisions that are not in the best interests of stockholders.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE and, as a result, we qualify for, but do not currently intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. You do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nThe Garcia Parties continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of Carvana Co. As a result, we continue to be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE corporate governance standards. Under the NYSE rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and need not comply with certain requirements, including the requirement that a majority of the Board consist of independent directors and the requirements that our compensation and nominating and governance committees be composed entirely of independent directors. We do not intend to utilize these exemptions; however, for so long as we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we will maintain the option to utilize some or all of these exemptions. If we utilize these exemptions, we may not have a majority of independent directors and our compensation and nominating and governance committees may not consist entirely of independent directors, and such committees will not be subject to annual performance evaluations. Accordingly, in the event we rely on these exemptions in the future, you would not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement with the LLC Unitholders requires us to make cash payments to them in respect of certain tax benefits to which we may become entitled, and we expect that the payments we will be required to make will be substantial.\nIn connection with the consummation of our IPO, we entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with the LLC Unitholders. Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, we will be required to make cash payments to such LLC Unitholders equal to 85% of the tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or, in some circumstances, are deemed to realize, as a result of (1) the increase in our wholly owned subsidiary\u2019s proportionate share of the existing tax basis of the assets of the LLC and an adjustment in the tax basis of the assets of the LLC reflected in that proportionate share as a result of any future exchanges of LLC Units held by the LLC Unitholders for shares of our Class A common stock or cash, and (2) certain other tax benefits related to payments we make under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Due to the uncertainty of various factors, we cannot estimate the likely tax benefits we will realize as a result of LLC Unit exchanges, and the resulting amounts we are likely to pay out to LLC Unitholders pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement; however, we estimate that such payments may be substantial. Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine, which tax reporting positions will be based on the advice of our tax advisors. Any payments made by us to the LLC Unitholders under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, such payments generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid. Nonpayment for a specified period, however, may constitute a breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement and therefore accelerate payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement, unless, generally, such nonpayment is due to a lack of sufficient funds. Furthermore, our future obligation to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that may be deemed realized under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are also not conditioned upon the LLC Unitholders maintaining a continued ownership interest in the LLC.\nThe actual amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges by the LLC Unitholders, the amount of gain recognized by such LLC Unitholders, the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future and the federal tax rates then applicable.\nThe amounts that we may be required to pay to the LLC Unitholders under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated in certain circumstances and may also significantly exceed the actual tax benefits that we ultimately realize.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement provides that if (1) certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control were to occur, (2) we breach any of our material obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement or (3) we elect an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, then the Tax Receivable Agreement will terminate and our obligations, or our successor\u2019s obligations, to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement would accelerate and become immediately due and payable. The amount due and payable in that circumstance is based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. We may need to incur debt to finance payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement\nto the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise.\nAs a result of a change in control or our election to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement early, (1) we could be required to make cash payments to the LLC Unitholders that are greater than the specified percentage of the actual benefits we ultimately realize in respect of the tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement and (2) we would be required to make an immediate cash payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits. In these situations, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nOur organizational structure, including the Tax Receivable Agreement, confers certain benefits upon the LLC Unitholders that will not benefit Class A common stockholders to the same extent as they will benefit the LLC Unitholders.\nOur organizational structure, including the Tax Receivable Agreement, confers certain benefits upon the LLC Unitholders that will not benefit the holders of our Class A common stock to the same extent. We entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with the LLC Unitholders, which will provide for the payment by us to the LLC Unitholders of 85% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in some circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of (1) the increase in our wholly owned subsidiary\u2019s proportionate share of the existing tax basis of the assets of the LLC and an adjustment in the tax basis of the assets of the LLC reflected in that proportionate share as a result of any future exchanges of LLC Units held by an LLC Unitholder for shares of our Class A common stock or cash and (2) certain other tax benefits related to our making payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Due to the uncertainty of various factors, we cannot estimate the likely tax benefits we will realize as a result of LLC Unit exchanges, and the resulting amounts we are likely to pay out to LLC Unitholders pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement; however, we estimate that such payments may be substantial. Although we will retain 15% of the amount of such tax benefits, this and other aspects of our organizational structure may adversely impact the future trading market for the Class A common stock.\nWe will not be reimbursed for any payments made to the LLC Unitholders under the Tax Receivable Agreement in the event that any tax benefits are disallowed.\nWe will not be reimbursed for any cash payments previously made to the LLC Unitholders pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement if any tax benefits initially claimed by us are subsequently challenged by a taxing authority and are ultimately disallowed. Instead, any excess cash payments made by us to an LLC Unitholder will be netted against any future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, a challenge to any tax benefits initially claimed by us may not arise for a number of years following the initial time of such payment or, even if challenged early, such excess cash payment may be greater than the amount of future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement and, as a result, there may not be future cash payments to net against. The applicable U.S. federal income tax rules are complex and factual in nature, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our tax reporting positions. As a result, it is possible that we could make cash payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are substantially greater than our actual cash tax savings.\nWe may not be able to realize all or a portion of the tax benefits that are currently expected to result from future exchanges of LLC Units for our Class A common stock, the utilization of certain tax attributes previously held by Carvana Group and from payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nOur ability to realize the tax benefits that we currently expect to be available as a result of the increases in tax basis created by any future exchanges of LLC Units (together with shares of our Class B common stock in the case of Class A Units) for our Class A common stock, the payments made pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, the pre-IPO net operating losses of Carvana Group and the interest deductions imputed under the Tax Receivable Agreement all depend on a number of assumptions, including that we earn sufficient taxable income each year during the period over which such deductions are available and that there are no changes in applicable law or regulations. For example, the reduction in corporate tax rates that was passed in 2017 reduced the expected value of the pre-IPO net operating losses of Carvana Group. If our actual taxable income were insufficient or there were adverse changes in applicable law or regulations, we may be unable to realize all or a portion of these expected benefits and our cash flows and stockholders\u2019 equity could be negatively affected.\nIn certain circumstances, Carvana Group will be required to make distributions to us and the LLC Unitholders and the distributions may be substantial.\nCarvana Group is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income is allocated to its members, including us. We intend to cause Carvana Group to make tax distributions quarterly to the holders of Class A Units (including us) on a pro rata basis based on Carvana Group\u2019s net taxable income and to the holders of Class B Units based on such holder\u2019s allocable share of Carvana Group\u2019s net taxable income (rather than on a pro rata basis). Funds used by Carvana Group to satisfy its tax distribution obligations will not be available for reinvestment in our business. Moreover, these tax distributions may be substantial, and will likely exceed (as a percentage of Carvana Group\u2019s income) the overall effective tax rate applicable to a similarly situated corporate taxpayer. As a result of the potential differences in the amount of net taxable income allocable to us and the LLC Unitholders, particularly in light of the reduction in corporate tax rates passed in 2017, it is possible that we will receive distributions significantly in excess of our tax liabilities and obligations to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. To the extent we do not distribute such cash balances as dividends on our Class A common stock and instead, for example, hold such cash balances or lend them to Carvana Group, the LLC Unitholders would benefit from any value attributable to such accumulated cash balances as a result of its ownership of Class A common stock following an exchange of its LLC Units (including any exchange upon an acquisition of us).\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States, and our tax liabilities will be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;\n\u2022expiration of or detrimental changes in research and development tax credit laws; or\n\u2022changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIf we were deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder Sections 3(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the 1940 Act, a company generally will be deemed to be an \u201cinvestment company\u201d for purposes of the 1940 Act if it (1) is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities or (2) is engaged, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We do not believe that we are an \u201cinvestment company,\u201d as such term is defined in either of those sections of the 1940 Act.\nAs the sole managing-member of Carvana Sub, we control and manage Carvana Sub, which, by virtue of being the sole managing-member of Carvana Group, in turn, controls and manages Carvana Group. On that basis, we believe that neither our interest in Carvana Sub nor Carvana Sub\u2019s interest in Carvana Group are \u201cinvestment securities\u201d under the 1940 Act. Therefore, we have less than 40% of the value of our total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) in \u201cinvestment securities.\u201d However, if we were to lose the right to manage and control Carvana Sub or if Carvana Sub were to lose the right to manage and control Carvana Group, interests in Carvana Group or Carvana Sub could be deemed to be \u201cinvestment securities\u201d under the 1940 Act.\nWe intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed to be an investment company. However, if we were deemed to be an investment company, restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Liquidity\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial flexibility and our competitive position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our credit agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had, on a consolidated basis, $248.8 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness represented by our vehicle inventory financing and security agreement dated as of July 27, 2015 (as amended, the \u201cFloor Plan Facility\u201d) between us and Ally Financial and $26.6 million aggregate principal amount outstanding indebtedness represented by our promissory note agreements as of various dates in 2016 and 2017 between us and third-party providers of equipment financing. Also, as of December 31, 2017, we had, on a consolidated basis, $27.3 million of other long-term debt related to our sale leaseback transactions. Our substantial indebtedness could have significant effects on our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our current and future indebtedness, including our Floor Plan Facility;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in prevailing economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, the execution of our business strategy and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022increase our cost of borrowing;\n\u2022restrict us from exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have fewer debt obligations; and\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy and other general corporate purposes.\nWe expect to use cash flow from operations to meet current and future financial obligations, including funding our operations, debt service requirements and capital expenditures. The ability to make these payments depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic, industry and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, economic and other factors beyond our control.\nHolders of our Class A Convertible Preferred Stock have rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of our Class A common stockholders, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and may result in the interests of such holders differing from those of our Class A common stockholders.\nHolders of Class A Convertible Preferred Stock have the right to receive a liquidation preference entitling them to be paid out of our assets available for distribution to stockholders before any payment may be made to holders of any other class or series of capital stock, an amount equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the liquidation preference thereof plus all accrued dividends or (b) the amount that such holders would have been entitled to receive upon our liquidation, dissolution and winding up if all outstanding shares of Class A Convertible Preferred Stock had been converted into Class A common stock immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up.\nIn addition, dividends on the Class A Convertible Preferred Stock accrue and are cumulative at the rate of 5.50% per annum, payable in cash quarterly in arrears. These dividend obligations could impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. Our obligations to the holders of Class A Convertible Preferred Stock could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. The preferential rights could also result in divergent interests between holders of the Class A Convertible Preferred Stock and holders of our Class A common stock.\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we may incur substantially more indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. We may also consider investments in joint ventures or acquisitions, which may increase our indebtedness. If new debt is added to our currently anticipated indebtedness levels, the related risks that we face could intensify.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under such indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance outstanding debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic, industry and competitive conditions and by financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Additionally, some of our debt accrues interest at a variable rate that is based on LIBOR or other market rates; if those market rates rise, so too will the amount we need to pay to satisfy our debt obligations. We may not be able to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow from operating activities to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. Any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which would also adversely affect our ability to incur additional indebtedness.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants. These alternative measures may not be successful, and we may be unable to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nIn the absence of such cash flows and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service obligations. We may not be able to consummate these asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices and on terms that we believe are fair, and any proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. If we cannot meet our debt service obligations, the holders of our indebtedness may accelerate such indebtedness and, to the extent such indebtedness is secured, foreclose on our assets. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness. If any of these risks are realized, our business and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Class A Common Stock\nThe Garcia Parties control us and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future.\nThe Garcia Parties together hold approximately 97% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock through their beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock as of December 31, 2017. The Garcia Parties are entitled to ten votes per share of Class B common stock they beneficially own, for so long as the Garcia Parties maintain, in the aggregate, direct or indirect beneficial ownership of at least 25% of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock (determined on an as-exchanged basis assuming that all of the Class A Units were exchanged for Class A common stock). Our Class A common stock has one vote per share. So long as the Garcia Parties continue to beneficially own a sufficient number of shares of Class B common stock, even if they beneficially own significantly less than 50% of the shares of our outstanding capital stock, the Garcia Parties will continue to be able to effectively control our decisions. For example, if the Garcia Parties hold Class B common stock amounting to 25% of our outstanding capital stock, they would collectively control 77% of the voting power of our capital stock.\nAs a result, the Garcia Parties have the ability to elect all of the members of our Board and thereby control our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our Class A common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends, if any, on our Class A common stock, the incurrence of debt by us, amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, and the entering into of extraordinary transactions. The interests of the Garcia Parties may not in all cases be aligned with your interests.\nIn addition, the Garcia Parties can determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, cause or prevent a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our Board, and preclude any acquisition of our company. This concentration of voting control could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of Class A common stock as part of a sale of our company and ultimately might affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, the Garcia Parties may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you. For example, the Garcia Parties could cause us to make acquisitions that increase our indebtedness or cause us to sell revenue-generating assets. The Garcia Parties may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. One of the Garcia Parties, Ernest Garcia, II, is the chairman of the board of directors and controlling shareholder of DriveTime, which could compete more directly with us in the future. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that DriveTime will enter into any new agreements, arrangements, extensions or renewals of existing agreements or arrangements with us on the same or similar terms, or at all. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of the Garcia Parties or any director who is not employed by us (including any non-employee director who serves as one of our officers in both his or her director and officer capacities) or his or her affiliates has any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. The Garcia Parties also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may otherwise be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nYou may be diluted by future issuances of additional Class A common stock or LLC Units in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise; future sales of such shares in the public market or the expectations that such sales may occur could lower our stock price.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue shares of our Class A common stock and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to our Class A common stock or the consideration of and on the terms and conditions established by our Board in its sole discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. The LLC Operating Agreement also authorizes Carvana Group to issue additional LLC Units whether in connection with an acquisition or otherwise. The LLC Unitholders may, at any time following the expiration of the lock-up period under the lock-up agreements, require Carvana Group to redeem all or a portion of their LLC Units in exchange for, at our election, (1) a cash payment by Carvana Group or (2) newly issued shares of Class A common stock, in each case in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Exchange Agreement. The market price of shares of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of these exchanges or the perception that an exchange could occur. These exchanges, or the possibility that these exchanges may occur, also might make it more difficult for holders of our Class A common stock to sell such stock in the future at a time and at a price that they deem appropriate.\nWe have reserved 14.0 million shares of Class A common stock for issuance under our 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the \"2017 Incentive Plan\"). As of December 31, 2017 we have granted 0.6 million restricted stock awards and units and options to purchase 0.8 million shares of Class A common stock to certain consultants, directors and employees. After considering the granted and forfeited awards, we have 12.7 million shares of Class A common stock available for future issuance under our 2017 Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2017. Any Class A common stock that we issue, including under our 2017 Incentive Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, would dilute the percentage ownership held by the investors who purchase Class A common stock.\nA decline in the price of our Class A common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of Class A common stock or other equity securities.\nPursuant to the LLC Operating Agreement, we may elect to issue shares of Class A common stock to fund a redemption of LLC Units for cash. Any sales in connection with exchange rights, or the prospect of any such sales, could materially impact the market price of our Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.\nWe have entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with certain LLC Unitholders. Any sales in connection with the Registration Rights Agreement, or the prospect of any such sales, could materially impact the market price of our Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.\nOur Class A common stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\nVolatility in the market price of our Class A common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for them. Many factors may cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate significantly, including those described elsewhere in this \u2018\u2018Risk Factors\u2019\u2019 section and this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the following:\n\u2022our operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u2022our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry compared to market expectations;\n\u2022future announcements concerning our business or our competitors\u2019 businesses;\n\u2022the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022the size of our public float;\n\u2022coverage by or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or failure to meet their expectations;\n\u2022market and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;\n\u2022strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022changes in laws or regulations which adversely affect our industry or us;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022changes in senior management or key personnel;\n\u2022issuances, exchanges or sales, or expected issuances, exchanges or sales of our capital stock;\n\u2022adverse resolution of new or pending litigation against us; and\n\u2022changes in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, acts of war and responses to such events.\nAs a result, volatility in the market price of our Class A common stock may prevent investors from being able to sell their Class A common stock at or above their purchase price or at all. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our Class A common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our Class A common stock is low.\nSubstantial blocks of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the market. If there are substantial sales of shares of our Class A common stock, the price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe price of our Class A common stock could decline if there are substantial sales of our Class A common stock (including sales of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of Class A Convertible Preferred Stock or exchange of LLC Units), particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and significant stockholders, or if there is a large number of shares of our Class A common stock available for sale. As of December 31, 2017, we have 18.1 million shares of our Class A common stock outstanding. All of the shares of Class A common stock sold in our IPO are available for sale in the public market. Shares held by directors, executive officers and other affiliates are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and various vesting agreements.\nOur Class A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holders at any time into shares of our Class A common stock at an initial conversion rate of 50.78 shares of Class A common stock for each share of Class A Convertible Preferred Stock, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $19.6945 per share of Class A common stock, subject to adjustment. As of December 31, 2017, these shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of our Class A Convertible Preferred Stock represented approximately 22% of our outstanding Class A common stock, on an as-converted basis.\nCertain of our LLC Unitholders have rights, subject to conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering Class A common stock issuable to them upon exchange of their LLC Units. Likewise, holders of Class A Convertible Preferred Stock have rights, subject to conditions, to require us to use commercially reasonable efforts to file a short-form registration statement covering Class A common stock issuable to them upon conversion of their Class A Convertible Preferred Stock. We would be required to include certain Class A common shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or our stockholders, subject to market standoff and lockup agreements. These registration rights would facilitate the resale of such securities into the public market, and any such resale would increase the number of shares of our Class A common stock available for public trading. We also intend to register shares of common stock that we have issued and may issue under our employee equity incentive plans. Once we register these shares, they will be able to be sold freely in the public market upon issuance, subject to existing market standoff or lock-up agreements.\nThe market price of the shares of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of the sale of a substantial number of our shares of Class A common stock in the public market or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of such shares intend to sell their shares.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently have no intention to pay dividends on our Class A common stock at any time in the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. Certain of our debt instruments contain covenants that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us. In addition, despite our current indebtedness, we may still be able to incur additional debt in the future, and such indebtedness may restrict or prevent us from paying dividends on our Class A common stock.\nFurthermore, our ability to declare and pay dividends may be limited by instruments governing future indebtedness we may incur.\nDelaware law and certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation may prevent efforts by our stockholders to change the direction or management of our company.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by-laws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our Board, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022the Garcia Parties are entitled to ten votes for each share of our Class B common stock they hold of record on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders for so long as the Garcia Parties maintain direct or indirect beneficial ownership of at least 25% of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock (determined on an as-exchanged basis assuming that all of the Class A Units were exchanged for Class A common stock);\n\u2022at such time as there are no outstanding shares of Class B common stock, only our Board may call special meetings of our stockholders;\n\u2022we have authorized undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval; and\n\u2022we require advance notice and duration of ownership requirements for stockholder proposals.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation also contains a provision that provides us with protections similar to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), and prevents us from engaging in a business combination with a person (excluding the Garcia Parties and their transferees) who acquires at least 15% of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock, unless board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to the acquisition. These provisions could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire, including actions that you may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, because our Board is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team.\nThese and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our Board or to initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current Board, a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company. The existence of these provisions could negatively affect the price of our common stock and limit opportunities for you to realize value in a corporate transaction.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides, subject to certain exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nPursuant to our certificate of incorporation, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees\nto us or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our certificate or our bylaws or (4) any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The forum selection clause in our certificate may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us or our directors and officers and may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our Class A common stock, which could depress the price of our Class A common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue one or more series of preferred stock. Our Board has the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of the shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our Class A common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discouraging bids for our Class A common stock at a premium to the market price, and materially adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our Class A common stock.\nFor as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, including those relating to auditor attestation requirements and disclosure about our executive compensation, that apply to other public companies.\nWe are an \u2018\u2018emerging growth company,\u2019\u2019 as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u2018\u2018emerging growth companies,\u2019\u2019 including, but not limited to, (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and (3) exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and of shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We have elected to adopt these reduced disclosure requirements. We cannot predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions and as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an \u2018\u2018emerging growth company\u2019\u2019 until the earliest of (a) December 31, 2022, (b) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenue exceeds $1.07 billion, (c) the date that we become a \u2018\u2018large accelerated filer\u2019\u2019 as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most-recently completed second fiscal quarter and (d) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the preceding three-year period.\nAs a public reporting company, we are subject to rules and regulations established from time to time by the SEC regarding our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to remediate material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or otherwise establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, or report them in a timely manner.\nAs a public reporting company, we are subject to the rules and regulations established from time to time by the SEC and the NYSE. These rules and regulations require that, among other things, we establish and periodically evaluate procedures with respect to our internal control over financial reporting. Reporting obligations as a public company are likely to place a considerable strain on our financial and management systems, processes and controls, as well as on our personnel. Our management team, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has limited experience managing a publicly traded company, and limited experience complying with the increasingly complex and changing laws pertaining to public companies.\nIn addition, as a public company we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the \u2018Sarbanes-Oxley Act so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting by the time our second annual report is filed with the SEC and thereafter, which has required and will continue to require us to document and make significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting. Likewise, our independent registered public accounting firm will be engaged to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting at such time as we cease to be an \u2018\u2018emerging growth company,\u2019\u2019 as defined in the JOBS Act.\nIf our senior management is unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, or to certify the effectiveness of such controls, or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an unqualified opinion on management\u2019s assessment and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, when required, or if material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting is identified, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, a loss of public and investor confidence, and to litigation from investors and stockholders, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price. In addition, if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, we may not be able to manage our business effectively or accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause a decline in our common stock price and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAn active trading market for our Class A common stock may not be sustained.\nAlthough our Class A common stock is currently listed on the NYSE, an active trading market for our Class A common stock may not be sustained. Accordingly, if an active trading market for our Class A common is not sustained, the liquidity of our Class A common stock, your ability to sell your shares of our Class A common stock when desired and the prices that you may obtain for your shares of Class A common stock will be adversely affected.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If we fail to meet the expectations of analysts for our operating results, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 16655, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "CVNA"}
