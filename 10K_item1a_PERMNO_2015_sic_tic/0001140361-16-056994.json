You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, before making your decision to invest in shares of our common stock. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. These risks could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and our future prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. If that were to happen, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to the Development and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates\nWe depend almost entirely on the success of one product candidate, EG-1962, which is expected to enter Phase 3 clinical development. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, EG-1962 or any other product candidate.\nWe currently have only one late stage product candidate, EG-1962, in clinical development, and our business depends almost entirely on its successful clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization. We currently have no drug products for sale and may never be able to develop marketable drug products. EG-1962 will require substantial additional clinical development, testing, and regulatory approval before we are permitted to commence its commercialization. Our other product candidates, including EG-1964 and EG-1963, are still in pre-clinical development stages. None of our product candidates have advanced into a Phase 3 trial. The clinical trials of our product candidates are, and the manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates will be, subject to extensive and rigorous review and regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States and in other countries where we intend to investigate and, if approved, market any product candidate. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidate, we must successfully meet a number of critical developmental milestones, including:\n\u2022 providing adequate and well-controlled data that the product candidate is safe and effective and shows a significant benefit over the active comparator in patients for the intended indication;\n\u2022 demonstrating that the product candidate formulation is reproducible and can meet the relevant release specifications for each market we intend to commercialize in; and\n\u2022 completing the development and scale-up to permit manufacture of our product candidates in commercial quantities and at acceptable prices.\nThe time necessary to achieve these developmental milestones for any individual product candidate is long and uncertain, and we may not successfully complete these milestones for EG-1962 or any other product candidates that we may develop. We have not yet completed development of any product. We may not be able to finalize the design or formulation of any product candidate. In addition, we may select components, solvents, excipients or other ingredients to include in our product candidates that have not previously been used in approved pharmaceutical products, which may require us to perform additional studies and may delay clinical testing and regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nWe are continuing to test and develop our product candidates and may explore possible design or formulation changes to address safety, efficacy, manufacturing efficiency and performance issues. We may not be able to complete development of any product candidates that will be safe and effective and that will have a commercially reasonable treatment and storage period. If we are unable to complete development of EG-1962, or any other product candidates that we may develop, we will not be able to commercialize and earn revenue from them.\nWe cannot be certain that our planned Phase 3 clinical trial of EG-1962 will be sufficient to support the submission of a marketing application for this product candidate, and in any event we may be required to obtain additional clinical and non-clinical data before a complete marketing applications may be submitted.\nIn general, the FDA requires two pivotal trials to support approval of an NDA, but in certain circumstances, will approve an NDA based on one pivotal trial based on the proposed indication and robustness of data from the single pivotal study. If successful, we believe the results from our planned single Phase 3 clinical trial of EG-1962, together with safety and efficacy data from the EG-1962 development program, could form the basis of an NDA submission in the US using the FDA 505(b)(2) pathway for EG-1962. However, depending upon the outcome of the current program, the FDA and/or other global health authorities may require that we provide additional data before we can submit a marketing application for EG-1962.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are inherently unpredictable, and if our product candidates are subject to multiple cycles of review or we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, including EG-1962, our business will be substantially harmed.\nOf the large number of drugs in development in the United States, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA regulatory approval process and are commercialized. We are not permitted to market EG-1962 in the United States or in other global markets until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA or the requisite approval from such other global markets. The planned single pivotal Phase 3 clinical study will, if successful, support and form the basis of approval for the global marketing applications for EG-1962. We completed the NEWTON trial in North America, and expect to enter into our Phase 3 program mid-2016. Successfully completing a Phase 3 clinical trial and obtaining approval of an NDA is complex, lengthy, and expensive. The FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may delay, limit or deny approval of EG-1962 for many reasons, including, among others:\nPage | 27\nIndex\n\u2022 disagreement with or disapproval of the design of, procedures for, or implementation of, our clinical trials;\n\u2022 disagreement with the sufficiency of the final content and data included in our marketing application, including disagreement with the sufficiency of a single Phase 3 trial;\n\u2022 failure to demonstrate that EG-1962 provides an overall benefit to risk over the comparator in the proposed indication;\n\u2022 failure of EG-1962 to demonstrate efficacy at the level of statistical significance required for approval;\n\u2022 a negative interpretation of the data from our preclinical studies or clinical trials, including our NEWTON trial;\n\u2022 deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or failure of third-party manufacturing facilities with whom we contract for clinical and commercial supplies to effectively and consistently manufacture product under current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP;\n\u2022 insufficient data collected from clinical trials of EG-1962 or changes in the approval policies or regulations that render our preclinical and clinical data insufficient to support the submission and filing of a marketing authorization application or to obtain regulatory approval; or\n\u2022 EG-1962\u2019s failure to overcome the orphan exclusivity of Nymalize, an oral nimodipine solution, for which the FDA granted market exclusivity in 2013 due to its orphan drug designation. The marketing exclusivity for Nymalize expires in May, 2020.\nThe FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may require more information, including additional preclinical or clinical data to support approval, which may delay or prevent approval and our commercialization plans, or cause us to abandon the development program. Even if we obtain regulatory approval, our product candidates may be approved for fewer or more limited indications than we request, such approval may be contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or we may not be allowed to include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of such product candidate. For instance, it is possible that EG-1962 could be approved but fail to replace nimodipine as the new standard of care for treating patients with aSAH. In addition, if EG-1962 produces undesirable side effects or safety issues, the FDA may require the establishment of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, including Elements to Ensure Safe Use, or ETASU, which are the most extensive elements of a REMS plan. Additionally, a comparable foreign regulatory authority may require the establishment of a similar strategy that may, for instance, restrict distribution of our products and impose burdensome implementation requirements on us.\nThe results of clinical trials may not support our product candidate claims.\nEven if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our proposed product candidate claims, that the FDA or government authorities in other countries will agree with our conclusions regarding such results, or that the FDA or governmental authorities in other countries will not require additional clinical trials. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. This failure could cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of other product candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay or prevent the filing of our marketing application with the FDA or other global health authorities and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials, including with respect to EG-1962. Due to, among other things, the small sample size of the data we have to date for EG-1962, there can be no assurance that our initial positive results will be indicative of results in future clinical trials with a larger and more diverse patient population, such as our planned Phase 3 trial. A number of companies in the biotechnology industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Our future clinical trials may not be successful.\nDelays in our clinical trials may slow our approval process and jeopardize our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products.\nWe may experience delays in our future clinical trials and we do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin or enroll patients on time, will need to be redesigned or will be completed on schedule, if at all. There can be no assurance that the FDA or other global health authority will not put any of our product candidates on clinical hold in the future. Clinical trials may be delayed, suspended or prematurely terminated for a variety of reasons, such as:\n\u2022 delay or failure in reaching agreement with the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority on a trial design that we are able to execute;\n\u2022 delay or failure in obtaining authorization to commence a trial or inability to comply with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of a clinical trial;\n\u2022 inability, delay or failure in identifying and maintaining a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs;\n\u2022 delay or failure in recruiting and enrolling suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u2022 delay or failure in having patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022 clinical sites and investigators deviating from trial protocol, failing to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, or dropping out of a trial;\n\u2022 withdrawal of clinical trial sites from our clinical trials as a result of changing standards of care or the ineligibility of a site to participate in our clinical trials;\nPage | 28\nIndex\n\u2022 delay or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022 delay or failure in obtaining institutional review board, or IRB, approval or the approval of other reviewing entities, including FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to conduct a clinical trial at each site;\n\u2022 failure of our third-party clinical trial managers to satisfy their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines;\n\u2022 ambiguous or negative interim results or results that are inconsistent with earlier results;\n\u2022 feedback from the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority, an IRB or Data Monitoring Committee, or DMC, on results from earlier stage or concurrent preclinical and clinical studies, that might require modification to the protocol;\n\u2022 decision by the FDA, a comparable foreign regulatory authority, an IRB, or recommendation by the DMC or us to suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for safety issues or for any other reason;\n\u2022 delay or failure in manufacturing or obtaining from third parties sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials;\n\u2022 lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional clinical studies and increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties; or\n\u2022 changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions.\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors, including the size and nature of the patient population (particularly with respect to orphan drugs because by definition they are intended for a relatively small patient population), the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, inability to obtain and maintain patient consents, risk that enrolled patients will drop out before completion, and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the therapeutic being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new therapeutics that may be approved or for which clinical trials are initiated for the indications we are investigating. We rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to help us ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and, while we have agreements governing their committed activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance.\nIf we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nWe may be required to suspend or discontinue clinical trials for a number of reasons, including as a result of adverse side effects or other safety risks that could preclude approval of any of our product candidates.\nOur clinical trials may be suspended at any time for a number of reasons. A clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, an IRB, the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, presentation of unforeseen safety issues, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using the investigational drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions, or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. In addition, clinical trials for our product candidates could be suspended due to adverse side effects. Although we are primarily concerned with hypotension in our clinical trials for EG-1962, we may also observe inflammation, infection, unacceptable elevated intracranial pressure or hydrocephalus or other unknown effects resulting from the delivery, in a single administration, of sustained concentrations of nimodipine directly to the site of injury in the brain. With respect to EG-1964, previous studies have shown that, aprotinin, when delivered systemically, can cause serious side effects, such as renal failure, thrombosis and rarely, anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is the only side effect reported after local delivery of aprotinin and only in patients who have already been exposed to aprotinin multiple times. Drug- related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. We may also voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to patients. If we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate any clinical trial of any product candidates that we develop, the commercial prospects of such product candidates will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues, if at all, from any of these product candidates will be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in international jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed abroad.\nIn order to market and sell our products outside the US in the European Union, Canada, and other international jurisdictions, we must obtain separate and distinct marketing approvals and comply with the respective regulatory requirements of each of these jurisdictions. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval, but can involve additional testing. In particular, nimodipine, the therapeutic used in EG-1962, has not previously been approved for use in Japan. As a result, the time required to obtain approval for EG-1962 in Japan may differ substantially from the time required to obtain approval for EG-1962 by the FDA. We may need to partner with third parties in order to obtain regulatory approvals outside the United States. Approval by the FDA does not necessarily guarantee approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions. Nor does the approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. If we are unable to obtain approval of EG-1962 or any of our other product candidates by regulatory authorities in the European Union, Canada, and other international jurisdictions, the commercial prospects of those product candidates may be significantly diminished and our business prospects could decline.\nPage | 29\nIndex\nApproval of EG-1962 could be more costly and take longer than anticipated as a result of Nymalize\u2019s existing orphan drug exclusivity.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and European Union, or the EU, may designate drugs for the treatment or prevention of rare diseases or conditions with relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. In the European Union/European Economic Area, or EU/EEA, a drug may be granted orphan designation if the product is intended to treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting less than 5 in 10,000 individuals in the European Union, and there exists no satisfactory authorized method of treatment of the condition or even if such treatment exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.\nIn the US, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for that time period. A similar provision in EU law allows ten years of market exclusivity in the EU/EEA and EU/EEA regulators are not permitted to accept another application for a market approval or accept an application for line-extension for the same therapeutic indication in respect of a similar medicinal product.\nThe EU/EEA exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if at the end of the fifth year of that period, a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that maintenance of the orphan designation and accordingly the marketing exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the FDA subsequently finds that the drug in fact had not been eligible for orphan drug designation at the time of submission of the request. In the European Union, the conditions for orphan designation must be confirmed by the EMA and its Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products before market approval is granted. The designated orphan medicinal product will be removed from the Community Registry of Orphan Medicinal Products if the conditions are not met.\nIf a drug is approved for an orphan indication, the FDA will not designate as an orphan another drug deemed the \u201csame drug\u201d for the same use as the approved orphan drug unless the sponsor of the new drug provides a plausible hypothesis that its new drug is clinically superior to the approved orphan drug. For small molecule drugs, FDA defines \u201csame drug\u201d to mean a drug that contains the same active moiety (meaning the molecule or ion of the molecule, responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance) as the previously approved drug, even if the particular ester or salt or other noncovalent derivative has not previously been approved. Clinical superiority means that the drug is shown to provide a significant therapeutic advantage over and above the approved same drug and can be established on the basis of greater safety, greater effectiveness, or, in unusual cases where neither greater safety nor greater effectiveness is shown, on the basis of a major contribution to patient care. Similarly, in the European Union / EEA, the orphan market exclusivity may be broken or otherwise derogated from in the following circumstances: (a) if the second product is not considered similar; (b) the second applicant can establish in the application that the second similar medicinal product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior including a major contribution to patient care; or (c) the holder of the MA for the first authorized orphan drug is unable to supply sufficient quantities of the medicinal product.\nOral nimodipine (in the form of gelatin capsules) was approved for the improvement of neurological outcome by reducing the incidence and severity of ischemic deficits in patients with aSAH in 1988 as Nimotop\u00ae and subsequently was approved in a generic version in 2007. Nimotop\u00ae has now been discontinued from marketing, and the FDA has determined that it was not discontinued for safety or effectiveness reasons. In September 2011, the FDA Office of Orphan Product Development, or OOPD, granted Nymalize\u00ae, an oral nimodipine solution, orphan drug designation for the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Subsequently, in May 2013, the FDA approved Nymalize for the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage, thereby granting the oral nimodipine solution seven years of marketing exclusivity until May 2020. In order for us to commercialize EG-1962 during the period of marketing exclusivity for Nymalize, we will need to demonstrate the clinical superiority of EG-1962 to the oral nimodipine solution. We intend to demonstrate that EG-1962 is clinically superior to the oral nimodipine solution by demonstrating superiority over oral nimodipine gelatin capsules in a head-to-head comparison in our Phase 3 program. To the extent the OOPD disagrees that we can demonstrate the clinical superiority of EG-1962 to Nymalize by demonstrating the superiority of EG-1962 to oral nimodipine gelatin capsules and requires us to include a head-to-head comparison of EG-1962 and Nymalize, our Phase 3 program would be more costly and may take longer than is currently anticipated or we may be required to delay the commercial launch of EG-1962 in the United States until Nymalize\u2019s orphan drug exclusivity expires in May 2020.\nEven if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product such as EG-1962, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition or another sponsor\u2019s nimodipine drug product may prove clinically superior to EG-1962.\nA fast track designation by the FDA may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nWe may seek fast track designation for some of our product candidates. If a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life- threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the sponsor may apply for FDA fast track designation. The FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant this designation, and even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for this designation, we cannot assure you that the FDA would decide to grant it. Even if we do receive fast track designation, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw fast track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program.\nPage | 30\nIndex\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may still face future development and regulatory difficulties and any approved products will be subject to extensive post-approval regulatory requirements.\nIf we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, it would be subject to extensive ongoing requirements by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities governing the manufacture, quality control, further development, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, import, export, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post- market information. The safety profile of any product will continue to be closely monitored by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities after approval. If the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities become aware of new safety information after approval of any of our product candidates, these regulatory authorities may require labeling changes or, depending on the nature of the safety information, establishment of a REMS or similar strategy, impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing, impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance, impose a recall or even move to withdraw the marketing approval for the product.\nIn addition, manufacturers of therapeutic products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current good manufacturing practice or cGMP regulations. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. If we, our product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may, among other things:\n\u2022 issue warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022 mandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners;\n\u2022 require us to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022 seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u2022 suspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022 suspend any ongoing clinical studies;\n\u2022 challenge any pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us;\n\u2022 suspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022 seize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenue. Advertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval in the United States may be heavily scrutinized by the FDA, including the Office of Prescription Drug Promotion, the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, Office of Inspector General, state attorneys general, members of Congress and the public. Violations, including promotion of our products for unapproved (or off-label) uses, are subject to enforcement letters, inquiries and investigations, and civil and criminal sanctions by the FDA. Additionally, advertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval outside of the United States will be heavily scrutinized by comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nIn the United States, engaging in impermissible promotion of our products for off-label uses can also subject us to false claims litigation under federal and state statutes, which can lead to civil and criminal penalties and fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which we promote or distribute those drug products. These false claims statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which allows any individual to bring a lawsuit against a pharmaceutical company on behalf of the federal government alleging submission of false or fraudulent claims, or causing to present such false or fraudulent claims, for payment by a federal program such as Medicare or Medicaid. If the government prevails in the lawsuit, the individual will share in any fines or settlement funds. Since 2004, these False Claims Act lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies have increased significantly in volume and breadth, leading to several substantial civil and criminal settlements based on certain sales practices promoting off-label drug uses. This growth in litigation has increased the risk that a pharmaceutical company will have to defend a false claim action, pay settlement fines or restitution, agree to comply with burdensome reporting and compliance obligations, and be excluded from the Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal and state healthcare programs. If we do not lawfully promote our approved products, we may become subject to such litigation and, if we are not successful in defending against such actions, those actions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Potential Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate any revenue.\nIn order to market and sell EG-1962 and our other product candidates in development, we currently intend to build and develop our own sales, marketing and distribution operations in the United States and Canada. Although our management team has previous experience with such efforts, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in building these operations. If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable. We will also be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded sales and marketing operations. Even if any of our product candidates are approved, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nPage | 31\nIndex\nOur commercial success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, among hospitals, physicians, patients and healthcare payors.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates that we may develop or acquire in the future, the product may not gain market acceptance among hospitals, physicians, health care payors, patients and the medical community. Market acceptance of any of our product candidates for which we receive approval depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 the efficacy and safety of such product candidates as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u2022 the clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved and any REMS that may be imposed as a condition of approval;\n\u2022 acceptance by major operators of hospitals, physicians and patients of the product candidate as a safe and effective treatment, particularly the ability of EG-1962 and our other product candidates to establish themselves as the new standard of care for the indications that we are pursuing;\n\u2022 the potential and perceived advantages of our product candidates over alternative treatments as compared to the relative costs of the product candidates and alternative treatments;\n\u2022 the safety of our product candidates seen in a broader patient group, including its use outside the approved indications;\n\u2022 the prevalence and severity of any side effects, such as hypotension with respect to EG-1962;\n\u2022 product labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022 the timing of market introduction of our products as well as competitive products;\n\u2022 the availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third party payors and government authorities;\n\u2022 relative convenience and ease of administration; and\n\u2022 the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and those of our future collaborators.\nThere may be delays in getting our drugs on hospitals\u2019 local formularies or limitations on coverages which can occur in the early stages of commercialization for newly approved drugs. If any of our product candidates are approved but fail to achieve market acceptance among hospitals, physicians, patients or health care payors, we will not be able to generate significant revenues, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if we are able to commercialize our product candidates, the products may not receive coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which could harm our business.\nOur ability to commercialize any products successfully will depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from Federal and State healthcare programs, private health insurers and other organizations. Payors, such as Federal and State healthcare programs, private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, determine which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. A trend in the healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Third-party payors also may seek additional clinical evidence, beyond the data required to obtain marketing approval, demonstrating clinical benefits and value in specific patient populations before covering our products for those patients. In particular, even if EG-1962 or any other product candidates we develop are established as having superior efficacy compared to the current standard of care, payors may not adequately reimburse for such product candidates. We cannot be sure that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, and/or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may only be temporary. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly or eventually obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-healthcare programs and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nIn the EU/EEA, even if the product is approved through the Centralized Procedure, national governments may not approve pricing and reimbursement for the product on grounds relating to cost-effectiveness under the respective national health service systems. This will have an effect of limiting or otherwise restricting access to the products by patients using public healthcare services in Member States of the EU/EEA.\nPage | 32\nIndex\nRecently enacted and future legislation, including potentially unfavorable pricing regulations or other healthcare reform initiatives, may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities or affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Medicare Modernization Act) established the Medicare Part D program and provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class thereunder. The Medicare Modernization Act, including its cost reduction initiatives, could decrease the coverage and reimbursement rate that we receive for any of our approved products. Furthermore, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in Medicare reimbursement may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nThe Healthcare Reform Law, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. It also contains substantial new provisions intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of health care spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms, any of which could negatively impact our business. The Affordable Care Act is likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nWe expect that the Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have been and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may compromise our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products. Similar austerity measures to contain healthcare costs under national rules may be applied in various EU Member States to limit or restrict market access to the product.\nLaws and regulations governing international operations may preclude us from developing, manufacturing and selling certain product candidates outside of the United States and require us to develop and implement costly compliance programs.\nAs we expand our operations outside of the United States, we must comply with applicable local laws and regulations relating to our business operations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The creation and implementation of international business practices compliance programs is costly and such programs are difficult to enforce, particularly where reliance on third parties is required.\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. The anti- bribery provisions of the FCPA are enforced primarily by the DOJ. The SEC is involved with enforcement of the books and records provisions of the FCPA.\nCompliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical studies and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.\nVarious laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the United States, it will require us to dedicate additional resources to compliance with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.\nThe failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial penalties, including suspension or debarment from government contracting. Violation of the FCPA can result in significant civil and criminal penalties. Indictment alone under the FCPA can lead to suspension of the right to do business with the U.S. government until the pending claims are resolved. Conviction of a violation of the FCPA can result in long-term disqualification as a government contractor. The termination of a government contract or relationship as a result of our failure to satisfy any of our obligations under laws governing international business practices would have a negative impact on our operations and harm our reputation and ability to procure government contracts. The SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions.\nSimilar consequences may accrue from business practices that violate other applicable anti-bribery/anti-corruption statutes in other jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom Bribery Act.\nPage | 33\nIndex\nWe intend to market EG-1962 and our other product candidates outside of the United States, either alone or through one or more international partners, and if we do, we will be subject to the risks of doing business outside of the United States.\nBecause we intend to market EG-1962 and other product candidates, if approved, outside of the United States, either alone or through one or more international partners, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States. Accordingly, our business and financial results in the future could be adversely affected due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022 failure to develop an international sales, marketing and distribution system for our products;\n\u2022 changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political and cultural climate or economic condition;\n\u2022 unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 difficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions;\n\u2022 inadequate intellectual property protection in foreign countries;\n\u2022 inadequate data protection against unfair commercial use;\n\u2022 trade-protection measures, import or export licensing requirements such as Export Administration Regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Commerce and fines, penalties or suspension or revocation of export privileges;\n\u2022 the effects of applicable foreign tax structures and potentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022 significant adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates; and\n\u2022 failure of third-party international partners with whom we contract for commercialization outside the United States and Canada to effectively and consistently commercialize EG-1962.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely completely on third-party suppliers to manufacture our clinical drug supplies for our product candidates, and we intend to rely on third parties to produce non-clinical, clinical and commercial supplies of any future product candidate.\nWe do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the infrastructure or capability to internally manufacture our clinical drug supply of our product candidates, or any future product candidates, for use in the conduct of our non-clinical studies and clinical trials, and we lack the internal resources and the capability to manufacture any product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. For example, the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for EG-1962 for our Phase 1/2 NEWTON clinical trial was manufactured at a third-party contract manufacturer\u2019s site. Additionally, the diluent of hyaluronic acid for EG-1962 was manufactured at a third-party contract manufacturer\u2019s site and the polymer microparticle for EG-1962 as formulated for our Phase 1/2 NEWTON clinical trial was manufactured at another third- party contract manufacturer\u2019s site. We have currently contracted, pursuant to the Oakwood Agreement, with Oakwood for the Phase 3 production of EG-1962. Currently, Oakwood is the sole manufacturer of the EG-1962 we plan to use in our Phase 3 pivotal study and we do not expect to enter into additional manufacturing agreements for such supply. In the event that Oakwood terminates the Oakwood Agreement or otherwise fails to perform in its production of EG-1962, we may not be able to commence our Phase 3 study in a timely manner.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers, such as Oakwood, entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product candidates or products ourselves. Although we are primarily responsible for regulatory compliance with respect to the manufacture of our products, we rely on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance activities. The possibility exists of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control (including a failure to synthesize and manufacture our product candidates or any products we may eventually commercialize in accordance with our specifications), and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that could be costly or damaging to us. In addition, although we are not in control of the day to day activities of our third-party manufacturers, we are nonetheless responsible for ensuring that our product candidates and any products that we may eventually commercialize are manufactured according to cGMP and similar foreign standards. Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of product candidates in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of our product candidates. In addition, such failure could be the basis for the FDA to issue a warning or untitled letter, withdraw approvals for product candidates previously granted to us, or take other regulatory or legal action, including recall or seizure, total or partial suspension of production, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, detention of product, refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunction, or imposing civil and criminal penalties.\nBecause of the complex nature of our compounds, our current manufacturers and any future manufacturers may not be able to manufacture our compounds at a cost or in quantities or in a timely manner necessary to make commercially successful products. If we successfully commercialize any of our drugs, we may be required to establish large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities. In addition, if our drug development pipeline increases and matures, we will have a greater need for clinical trial and commercial manufacturing capacity. We have no experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products on a commercial scale and some of these manufacturers will need to increase their scale of production to meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, the satisfaction of which may not be met on a timely basis.\nWe rely on third-party CROs to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.\nPage | 34\nIndex\nWe have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third-party CROs to monitor and manage data for our ongoing preclinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties to assist us in the execution of our preclinical and clinical trials, and control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We also rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, requirements and the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act of 1966 requirements (and the equivalent requirements outside the United States). We and our CROs are required to comply with regulations and current Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, which are enforced by the FDA, and EU law requirements governing GCPs to be applied by the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Union and European Economic Area, or EEA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities to ensure that the health, safety and rights of patients are protected in clinical development and clinical trials, and that trial data integrity as well as protection of personal data of the trial subjects is assured. Regulatory authorities ensure compliance with these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP requirements. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with products produced under cGMP requirements. Failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat preclinical and clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nOur CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical and preclinical programs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nBecause we have relied on third parties, our internal capacity to perform these functions is limited. Outsourcing these functions involves risk that third parties may not perform to our standards, may not produce results in a timely manner or may fail to perform at all. In addition, the use of third-party service providers requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that this information will be misappropriated. We currently have a small number of employees, which limits the internal resources we have available to identify and monitor our third-party providers. To the extent we are unable to identify and successfully manage the performance of third-party service providers in the future, our business may be adversely affected. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nIf we lose our relationships with CROs or other third-party vendors, our drug development efforts could be delayed.\nWe rely on third-party vendors and CROs for preclinical studies and clinical trials related to our drug development efforts. Switching or adding additional CROs or third-party vendors involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. Our CROs and third-party vendors have the right to terminate their agreements with us in the event of an uncured material breach. In addition, some of our CROs and third-party vendors have an ability to terminate their respective agreements with us if it can be reasonably demonstrated that the safety of the patients participating in our clinical trials warrants such termination. Identifying, qualifying and managing performance of third-party service providers can be difficult, time consuming and cause delays in our development programs. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO or third-party vendor commences work, and the new CRO or third-party vendor may not provide the same type or level of services as the original provider. If any of our relationships with our third-party CROs or third-party vendors terminate, we may not be able to enter into timely arrangements with alternative CROs or third-party vendors or do so on commercially reasonable terms.\nDisruptions in our supply chain could delay the commercial launch of our product candidates.\nAny significant disruption in our supplier relationships could harm our business. We currently rely on a single source supplier for the API for nimodipine, as well as a single supplier for the polymer, microparticles and the diluent of hyaluronic acid, used to make EG-1962. Further, Oakwood is the sole manufacturer of EG-1962 needed to conduct our Phase 3 pivotal study and we are required to supply Oakwood with the nimodipine and other materials necessary for the product of EG-1962. If Oakwood or any of these other single source suppliers is unable or unwilling to manufacture sufficient quantities of these key materials in a reasonable timeframe or suffers a major natural or man-made disaster at its manufacturing facility, we would not be able to manufacture EG-1962 for our ongoing clinical studies or on a commercial scale until a qualified alternative supplier is identified. Although alternative sources of supply exist, the number of third party suppliers with the necessary manufacturing and regulatory expertise and facilities is limited, and it could be expensive and take a significant amount of time to arrange for alternative suppliers. Any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate or its key materials for an ongoing clinical trial could considerably delay completion of our clinical studies, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates. If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these key materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for our product candidates, the commercial launch of our product candidates would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our product candidates.\nPage | 35\nIndex\nOur relationships with customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. As a pharmaceutical company, even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to our business. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute constrains our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities, by prohibiting, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022 federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022 HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also created federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u2022 HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022 the federal physician sunshine requirements under the Affordable Care Act requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to HHS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, certain other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and certain other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations;\n\u2022 analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as measures relating to inducements designed to promote prescription, supply, sale or intake of drugs, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and certain other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. Additionally, state and foreign laws govern the privacy or personal data and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to comply with manufacturing standards we have established, to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted and implemented and are enforcing a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity, such as employee training on enforcement of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Strategy\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our executive officers and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nBecause of the specialized scientific and managerial nature of our business, we rely heavily on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. We are highly dependent upon current management, especially two of our founders, Brian A. Leuthner and Dr. R. Loch Macdonald, who are the driving force behind the operation and successful implementation of our business strategy. Although we have employment agreements with Mr. Leuthner and Dr. Macdonald and other key employees, these agreements are at-will and do not prevent them from terminating their employment with us at any time and joining one of our competitors. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or other employees. We intend to increase our technical and management staff as needs arise and supporting resources are available, but the loss of one or more of our senior executive officers, including their death or incapacitation, could be detrimental to us if we cannot recruit suitable replacements in a timely manner. The competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field is intense and, as a result, we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to recruit suitable replacement personnel.\nPage | 36\nIndex\nWe will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 24 full-time employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, or as a result of any future acquisitions, we will need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources. Our management, personnel and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n\u2022 managing our clinical trials and product development processes effectively;\n\u2022 identifying, recruiting, maintaining, motivating and integrating additional employees;\n\u2022 managing our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, contractors and other third parties;\n\u2022 improving our managerial, development, operational and finance systems; and\n\u2022 expanding our facilities.\nAs our operations expand, we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively and hire, train and integrate additional management, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and is subject to rapid and significant technological change, which could render our technologies and products obsolete or uncompetitive.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and is subject to rapid and significant technological change that could render certain of our products obsolete or uncompetitive. There is no assurance that our product candidates will be the best, the safest, the first to market, or the most economical to make or use. The introduction of competitive therapies as alternatives to our product candidates could dramatically reduce the value of those development projects or chances of successfully commercializing those product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our long-term financial success. Additionally, other technologies may become available that can monitor intracranial pressure without the need for an EVD, which would require physicians to put in place an EVD solely to administer EG-1962 and thereby substantially increase the additional level of invasiveness needed to deliver EG-1962 through our initial route of administration.\nWe plan to compete with companies in North America and internationally, including major pharmaceutical and chemical companies, specialized CROs, research and development firms, universities and other research institutions. In the United States, oral nimodipine is manufactured by generic companies, and there is no brand name drug. In May 2013, the FDA approved Nymalize, an oral nimodipine solution, for the treatment of aSAH, granting it seven years of marketing exclusivity due to its orphan drug designation. In Japan and China, there are two drugs that are used to treat aSAH patients, fasudil and sodium ozagrel. Many of our potential competitors have greater financial resources and selling and marketing capabilities, greater experience in clinical testing and human clinical trials of pharmaceutical products and greater experience in obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals than we do. In addition, some of our potential competitors may have lower development and manufacturing costs.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, the servers of our cloud-based computing providers and other systems, and those of our CROs and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nAny future collaborators may compete with us or have interests which conflict with ours. This may restrict our research and development efforts and limit the areas of research in which we intend to expand.\nLarge pharmaceutical companies with whom we may seek to collaborate may have internal programs or enter into collaborations with our competitors for products addressing the same medical conditions targeted by our technologies. Thus, such collaborators may pursue alternative technologies or product candidates in order to develop treatments for the diseases or disorders targeted by our collaborative arrangements. Such collaborators may pursue these alternatives either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our competitors. Depending on how other product candidates advance, a corporate partner may slow down or abandon its work on our product candidates or terminate its collaborative arrangement with us in order to focus on these other prospects.\nIf any conflicts arise, our future collaborators may act in their own interests, which may be adverse to ours. In addition, in our future collaborations, we may be required to agree not to conduct any research that is competitive with the research conducted under our future collaborations. Our future collaborations may have the effect of limiting the areas of research that we may pursue. Our collaborators may be able to develop products in related fields that are competitive with the products or potential products that are the subject of these collaborations.\nPage | 37\nIndex\nWe may engage in future acquisitions that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders and harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWhile we currently have no specific plans to acquire any other businesses, we may, in the future, make acquisitions of, or investments in, companies that we believe have products or capabilities that are a strategic or commercial fit with our current product candidates and business or otherwise offer opportunities for our company. In connection with these acquisitions or investments, we may:\n\u2022 issue stock that would dilute our stockholders\u2019 percentage of ownership;\n\u2022 expend cash;\n\u2022 incur debt and assume liabilities; and\n\u2022 incur amortization expenses related to intangible assets or incur large and immediate write-offs.\nWe also may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete an acquisition, we cannot assure you that it will ultimately strengthen our competitive position or that it will not be viewed negatively by customers, financial markets or investors. Further, future acquisitions could also pose numerous additional risks to our operations, including:\n\u2022 problems integrating the purchased business, products or technologies;\n\u2022 increases to our expenses;\n\u2022 the failure to have discovered undisclosed liabilities of the acquired asset or company;\n\u2022 diversion of management\u2019s attention from their day-to-day responsibilities;\n\u2022 harm to our operating results or financial condition;\n\u2022 entrance into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience; and\n\u2022 potential loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired entity.\nWe may not be able to complete one or more acquisitions or effectively integrate the operations, products or personnel gained through any such acquisition without a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenues and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our product candidates and supply the applicable therapeutic for our product candidates. Our ability to obtain clinical supplies of product candidates could be disrupted, if the operations of these suppliers are affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption. Similarly, we rely on third party CROs and other third party vendors for the conduct of our clinical trials. Our ability to conduct such clinical trials could be disrupted, if the operations of these CROs and other third party vendors are affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of $47.5 million and $23.3 million, respectively, due to prior period losses. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. We believe that we may have already undergone one or more ownership changes.\nIn addition, future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Although we have not completed an analysis under Section 382 of the Code, it is likely that the utilization of the NOLs will be limited. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOLs reflected on our balance sheet, even if we attain profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality, licensing and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. Where we have the right to do so under our license agreements, we seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business.\nPage | 38\nIndex\nWe have one issued U.S. patent covering a method of treating cerebral vasospasm in humans by administering a therapeutic composition via surgical injection into the subarachnoid space near the cerebral artery at risk for cerebral vasospasm. This method of treatment patent, assuming all maintenance fees are paid, is scheduled to expire in 2029. In addition, we co-own, together with Evonik Industries, or Evonik, an issued U.S. patent with claims directed to a process for producing microparticles encapsulating a particular polymorphic form of nimodipine, a semisolid delivery system containing microparticles comprising the particular polymorphic form of nimodipine, and to a method of treating a cerebral artery in a subarachnoid space at risk of interruption due to a brain injury using such a delivery system. The patent claims cover the microparticulate formulation comprising a particular polymorphic form of nimodipine. This patent is scheduled to expire in 2033.\nWith respect to EG-1964 and our other development efforts, we have one issued U.S. patent covering a method of treating hematoma expansion or recurrent bleeding resulting from a hemorrhagic condition, such as cSDH, by administering an anti-fibrinolytic therapeutic agent, such as aprotinin. This patent, assuming all maintenance fees are paid, is scheduled to expire in 2028. However, the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and have in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patents, including those patent rights licensed to us by third parties, are highly uncertain.\nThe steps we have taken to police and protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, both inside and outside the United States. The rights already granted under any of our currently issued patents and those that may be granted under future issued patents may not provide us with the proprietary protection or competitive advantages we are seeking. If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficient, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or superior to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.\nWith respect to patent rights, we do not know whether any of the pending patent applications for any of our product candidates will result in the issuance of patents that protect our technology or products, or which will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Our pending applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications. Further, the examination process may require us, or for in-licensed technology, our licensors to narrow the claims, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained. Although we have a number of issued patents, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and issued patents that we own or have licensed from third parties may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in the loss of patent protection, the narrowing of claims in such patents, or the invalidity or unenforceability of such patents, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection for our technology and products.\nProtecting against the unauthorized use of our patented technology, trademarks and other intellectual property rights is expensive, difficult and, may in some cases not be possible. In some cases, it may be difficult or impossible to detect third party infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, even in relation to issued patent claims, and proving any such infringement may be even more difficult.\nWe could be required to incur significant expenses to obtain our intellectual property rights, and we cannot ensure that we will obtain meaningful patent protection for our products.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we, Evonik or any future licensors may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. In addition, it is also possible that we or our licensors will fail to identify patentable aspects of further inventions made in the course of our development and commercialization activities before they are publicly disclosed, making it too late to obtain patent protection on them. Further, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms where these are available in any countries where we are prosecuting patents. This includes in the United States under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, which permits a patent term extension for regulatory delay of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a patent based only on its earliest filing date plus any patent term adjustments due to patent office delays during prosecution that covers an approved product where the permission for the commercial marketing or use of the product is the first permitted commercial marketing or use, and as long as the remaining term of the patent does not exceed fourteen years. However the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, and any equivalent regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. If this occurs, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and these foreign laws may also be subject to change. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all. Therefore we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.\nIn March 2013, the United States transitioned to a \u2018first to file\u2019 system in which the first inventor to file a patent application that meets the requirements for patent eligibility is entitled to the patent. Third parties are allowed to submit prior art prior to the issuance of a patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, and may become involved in post-grant proceedings, for example, ex parte reexamination and inter partes review proceedings on patents granted from applications filed before or after March 16, 2013, post- grant review or derivation proceedings for patents granted from applications filed on or after March 16, 2013, or interference proceedings for applications filed before March 16, 2013, challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, which could adversely affect our competitive position with respect to third parties.\nPage | 39\nIndex\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submissions, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the U.S. PTO, and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The U.S. PTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of our own intellectual property rights or the proprietary rights of others. This can be expensive and time consuming. Many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to defend their intellectual property rights than we can. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, which could harm our business and financial results. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent owned by, or licensed to, us is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. If any of these occur, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nFrom time to time we may need to rely on licenses to proprietary technologies, which may be difficult, expensive or not possible to obtain or we may lose certain licenses which may be difficult or not possible to replace.\nWe may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties to develop, manufacture and market our product candidates. For example, EG-1962 requires a microparticulate delivery system to facilitate direct delivery to the brain. We have licensed certain patent rights and know-how from Evonik that may claim or cover EG-1962. It is possible that the license from Evonik could be terminated. In that case, we may lose our ability to develop, manufacture or market certain products which rely on Evonik patents and know-how. In such event or under other circumstances, we may have to obtain a new license from Evonik or some other third party, which licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms and maintain these licenses, our ability to commercially market our product candidates may be inhibited or prevented, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates, and to use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference and various post grant proceedings before the U.S. PTO, and opposition proceedings at other patent offices. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. We are aware of a third party U.S. patent claiming a method for universally distributing a therapeutic agent to the brain as well as compositions for administration into the cerebrospinal fluid of a subject with a stroke or a traumatic brain injury that expires in 2018. In the event a third party were to assert an infringement claim against us and we were ultimately found to infringe the third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and commercializing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain an appropriate license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, in any such proceeding or litigation, we could be found liable for monetary damages. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Any claims by third parties that we have misappropriated their confidential information or trade secrets could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nOur trade secrets are difficult to protect.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information and may not adequately protect our intellectual property.\nPage | 40\nIndex\nOur success depends upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, our consultants and advisors as well as our partners, licensors and contractors. Because we operate in a highly competitive technical field of drug discovery, we rely in part on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology and processes. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, corporate partners, consultants, sponsored researchers and other advisors. These agreements generally require that the receiving party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all confidential information developed by the receiving party or made known to the receiving party by us during the course of the receiving party\u2019s relationship with us.\nThese confidentiality and assignment agreements may be breached and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us.\nOur trade secrets also could be independently discovered by competitors, in which case we would not be able to prevent use of such trade secrets by our competitors. The enforcement of a claim alleging that a party illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets could be difficult, expensive and time consuming and the outcome would be unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets. The failure to obtain or maintain meaningful trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers or other third parties.\nMany of our employees, including our senior management, and consultants were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees, including each member of our senior management, and consultants executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees and consultants have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s or consultant\u2019s former employer. We are not aware of any threatened or pending claims related to these matters or concerning the agreements with our senior management, but in the future litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property disputes could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and/or management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive.\nCompetitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a clinical-stage biotechnology company. Investment in biotechnology product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that a product candidate, such as EG-1962, our lead product candidate, will fail to gain regulatory approval or become commercially viable. We have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and we continue to incur significant development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred losses in each period since our inception in 2009. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we reported a net loss of $28.1 million and $12.2 million, respectively.\nWe expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, and begin to commercialize any approved products. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenues. If EG-1962 or any of our other product candidates fail in clinical trials or do not gain regulatory approval, or if approved, fail to achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 (deficit) equity and working capital.\nPage | 41\nIndex\nWe have not generated any revenues since inception and may never become profitable.\nTo date, we have not generated any revenues since our inception. Our ability to generate revenue and become profitable depends upon our ability to successfully obtain marketing approval and commercialize products, including EG-1962 or other product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire in the future. Even if we are able to successfully achieve regulatory approval for these product candidates, we do not know when any of these products will generate revenue for us, if at all. Our ability to generate revenue from EG-1962 or other product candidates also depends on a number of additional factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022 successfully complete development activities, including the necessary clinical trials;\n\u2022 complete and submit marketing authorization applications to the FDA and obtain regulatory approval for an indication for which there is a commercial market;\n\u2022 complete and submit marketing authorization applications to, and obtain regulatory approval from, foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022 set a commercially viable price for our products;\n\u2022 develop and obtain commercial quantities of our products at acceptable cost levels;\n\u2022 develop a commercial organization capable of sales, marketing and distribution for the products we intend to sell ourselves in the markets in which we have retained commercialization rights;\n\u2022 find suitable partners to help us market, sell and distribute our approved products in other markets; and\n\u2022 obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party, including government, payors.\nIn addition, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, including that our product candidates may not advance through development or be shown to be safe and effective for their intended uses, the FDA or any other regulatory agency may require additional clinical trials or preclinical studies. We are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to complete the process described above, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing these products.\nEven if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of our products, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.\nWe have a limited operating history, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nWe were formed in January 2009. Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring or developing product and technology rights, and conducting product development activities for our product candidates, primarily EG- 1962. We have not yet obtained regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. Consequently, any predictions about our future success, performance or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or approved products on the market.\nWe will require additional capital to fund our operations and if we fail to obtain necessary financing, we will not be able to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates, including EG-1962.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to advance the clinical development of our product candidates and to launch and commercialize any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval, including potentially building our own commercial organization to address the United States and certain other markets. As of December 31, 2015 we had cash and cash equivalents of $130.2 million. We may require additional capital for the further development of our product candidates and, if we conduct additional Phase 3 trials of EG-1962, we may seek to raise additional funds sooner in order to accelerate development of our product candidates and we will need to raise additional funds to commercialize any of our product candidates.\nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our products or product candidates or one or more of our other research and development initiatives. We also could be required to:\n\u2022 seek collaborators for one or more of our current or future product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; or\n\u2022 relinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.\nOur forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future funding requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\nPage | 42\nIndex\n\u2022 the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of the clinical trials for our product candidates to obtain regulatory approval, particularly whether the FDA requires us to complete two Phase 3 trials for EG-1962 for the treatment of aSAH or changes to the anticipated design of our Phase 3 program, such as changes in the required control arm of any such trial;\n\u2022 the outcome of interactions with the FDA and other non-U.S. health authorities that may alter our proposed Phase 3 program for EG-1962 to meet the standards for approval of an NDA (or foreign equivalent) or for obtaining a marketing authorization in aSAH;\n\u2022 the outcome of our efforts to demonstrate clinical superiority to Nymalize in order to obtain orphan drug status;\n\u2022 the clinical development plans we establish for these product candidates;\n\u2022 the number and characteristics of product candidates that we develop or may in-license;\n\u2022 the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to require that we perform more studies than those that we currently expect;\n\u2022 the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 the cost of defending intellectual property disputes, including patent infringement actions brought by third parties against us or our product candidates;\n\u2022 the effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022 the cost and timing of completion of commercial-scale outsourced manufacturing activities; and\n\u2022 the cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval in regions where we choose to commercialize our products on our own.\nOur debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition and may result in further dilution to our shareholders.\nWe have entered into a loan and security agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc., or Hercules, pursuant to which we have borrowed $6,000,000 from Hercules at an initial interest rate of 10.45% per annum. We must repay the indebtedness on or before March 1, 2018 and have paid Hercules an origination fee of $100,000. Since October 2015, we have made and must continue to make 30 equal monthly payments of principal plus interest. To the extent we desire to prepay the indebtedness prior to maturity, we will be obligated to pay a prepayment penalty to Hercules ranging from 1% to 3% of the amounts being prepaid, depending on when such prepayment occurs. In addition, at the time that the loan is either due or prepaid, we must pay Hercules a fee equal to 1.5% of the total amounts funded at such time. Our ability to make payments on this indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. We expect to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operations and capital expenditures. There can be no assurance that we will be in a position to repay this indebtedness when due or obtain extensions of the maturity date. We anticipate that we will need to secure additional funding in order for us to be able to satisfy our obligations when due. We cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If that additional funding involves the sale of equity securities or convertible securities, it would result in the issuance of additional shares of our capital stock, which would result in dilution to our stockholders. The indebtedness is secured by substantially all of our assets other than intellectual property, on which we have given Hercules a negative pledge. In addition, under the loan agreement, we are subject to certain customary covenants that limit or restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant any security interests, pay cash dividends, repurchase our common stock, make loans, or enter into certain transactions without the prior consent of Hercules.\nThis level of debt could have important consequences to you as an investor in our securities. For example, it could:\n\u2022 limit our flexibility in planning for the development, clinical testing, approval and marketing of our products;\n\u2022 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our competitors that are less leveraged than we are;\n\u2022 increase our vulnerability to both general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions; and\n\u2022 limit our ability to obtain additional funds.\nIn addition, as part of this financing with Hercules, we issued a warrant to Hercules to purchase up to 107,526 shares of our Series C-1 Preferred Stock, which is exercisable until October of 2020. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for a more detailed discussion of the transaction with Hercules.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nPage | 43\nIndex\nWe may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of existing stockholders. Debt financings may be coupled with an equity component, such as warrants to purchase stock, which could also result in dilution of our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business and may result in liens being placed on our assets and intellectual property. If we were to default on such indebtedness, we could lose such assets and intellectual property. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe trading market in our common stock has been extremely limited and substantially less liquid than the average trading market for a stock quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market.\nPrior to our IPO there was no market for shares of our common stock. Since our initial listing on the NASDAQ Global Market on October 1, 2015, the trading market in our common stock has been limited and substantially less liquid than the average trading market for companies quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market. The quotation of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market does not assure that a meaningful, consistent and liquid trading market currently exists. We cannot predict whether a more active market for our common stock will develop in the future. An absence of an active trading market could adversely affect our stockholders' ability to sell our common stock at current market prices in short time periods, or possibly at all. Additionally, market visibility for our common stock may be limited and such lack of visibility may have a depressive effect on the market price for our common stock. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 58% of our outstanding shares of common stock was held by our officers, directors, beneficial owners of 5% or more of our capital stock and their respective affiliates, which adversely affects the liquidity of the trading market for our common stock, inasmuch as federal securities laws restrict sales of our shares by these stockholders under certain circumstances. If our affiliates continue to hold their shares of common stock, there will be limited trading volume in our common stock, which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares or increase the volatility of our stock price.\nMarket volatility may affect our stock price and the value of your investment.\nThe trading price of our common stock, similar to other biotechnology companies, is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, among others:\n\u2022 announcement of the results of our Phase 3 program for EG-1962 or any other future clinical trials of our product candidates, including any delays in enrollment rates or timing of these trials, as well as the lack of news about the status of our programs;\n\u2022 regulatory actions with respect to our products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022 the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u2022 results of clinical trials of our competitors;\n\u2022 the success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u2022 regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022 developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022 the level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022 variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022 fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022 share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022 announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u2022 sales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders;\n\u2022 changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022 market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors; and\n\u2022 general economic, industry and market conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies.\nBroad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in these \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nPage | 44\nIndex\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, publish inaccurate or unfavorable research or cease publishing research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on our company. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock would likely be negatively impacted. In the event securities or industry analysts initiate coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, or cease publishing about us, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or other issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to equity incentive plans could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nOur stock price could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 28,810,845 shares of common stock outstanding. The resale of 20,255,331 shares, or 70% of our outstanding shares as of December 31, 2015 is currently prohibited or otherwise restricted as a result of securities law provisions, market standoff agreements entered into by our stockholders with us, or lock-up agreements entered into by our stockholders with the underwriters of our initial public offering; however, subject to applicable securities law restrictions, these shares will be able to be sold in the public market beginning as early as March 29, 2016.\nWe have also registered the offer and sale of all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans and pursuant to inducement grants of options to executives and other employees, including upon the exercise of stock options. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to the lock-up agreements expiring on March 29, 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the holders of up to 9,064,064 shares, or 31%, of our common stock outstanding, will have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. Once we register the offer and sale of shares for the holders of registration rights, they can be freely sold in the public market.\nIn addition, in the future, we may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into common stock in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement, employee arrangements or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nFuture issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To raise capital, or in connection with an acquisition, litigation settlement, employee arrangements or otherwise, we may sell substantial amounts of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock. These future issuances of common stock or common stock-related securities, together with the exercise of outstanding options to purchase 4,302,267 shares of common stock as of December 31, 2015 and any additional shares issued in connection with acquisitions, if any, may result in material dilution to our investors. Such issuances may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nWe may be at an increased risk of securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our executive officers, directors, holders of 5% or more of our capital stock and their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 58% of our outstanding voting stock (assuming no exercise of outstanding stock options). These stockholders may be able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nPage | 45\nIndex\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or certificate of incorporation, and amended and restated bylaws, or bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, or remove our current management. These provisions include:\n\u2022 authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u2022 prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow for less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022 prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022 eliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022 establishing a staggered board of directors; and\n\u2022 establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management. Because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of our outstanding indebtedness preclude, and any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we intend to take advantage of reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could result in our common stock being less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company, which could be for up to five years.\nIf investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our reduced reporting requirements, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may also be unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Commencing with our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2016, we will be required, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also generally requires an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement.\nPage | 46\nIndex\nOur compliance with Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We currently do not have an internal audit group, and we will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge, and compile the system and process documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting once that firm begin its Section 404 reviews, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by NASDAQ, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosures due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and may not use them effectively.\nOn October 6, 2015 we completed our initial public offering of 8,412,423 shares of the Company's common stock, at a price of $11.00 per share, including 1,097,272 shares of common stock issued upon the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares at the same price to cover over-allotments. We received net proceeds of approximately $82.8 million from the sale, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses. The offer and sale of all of the shares in the initial public offering were registered under the Securities Act in accordance with a final prospectus filed on October 2, 2015 with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) of the Securities Act.\nWe have invested the net proceeds from the offering in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short-term, investment grade, interest bearing instruments such as U.S. government securities and money market funds. We have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and could spend the proceeds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our stock. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause the market price of our common stock to decline and delay the development of our product candidates. Pending their use, we may invest the net proceeds from the offering in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value. If we do not invest the net proceeds from the offering in ways that enhance stockholder value, we may fail to achieve expected financial results, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nUntil recently, we operated as a private company and therefore, have limited experience operating as a public company and complying with public company obligations. Complying with these requirements has increased our costs and requires additional management resources, and we still may fail to meet all of these obligations.\nWe are facing increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses as a public company. Compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, as well as rules of the SEC and NASDAQ, for example, will continue to result in significant initial cost to us as well as ongoing increases in our legal, audit and financial compliance costs, particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. Our board of directors, management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and require us to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage.\nWe expect to incur significant expense and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 once we lose our status as an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We currently do not have an internal audit group, and we will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. Implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training for our directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs to modify our existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements or other reports on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business.\nPage | 47\nIndex", "PERMNO": 15784, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PDSB"}
