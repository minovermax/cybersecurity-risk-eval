{"cik": "81362", "company": "QUAKER CHEMICAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nThere are many factors that may affect our business and\nresults of operations, including the following risks relating to: (1) the\ndemand for our products and services and our ability to grow our\ncustomer base; (2) our business operations, including internal and\nexternal factors that may impact our operational continuity; (3) our international\noperations; (4) our supply chain; (5) domestic and\nforeign taxation and government regulation and oversight; and (6)\nmore general risk factors that may impact our business.\nRisks Related to the Demand for our Products and Services and our\nCustomer Base\nChanges to the industries and markets that we serve could have a material\nadverse effect on our liquidity, financial position\nand\nresults of operations.\nAs the leader in industrial process fluids, the Company is subject to the same business\ncycles as those experienced by our\ncustomers that participate in the steel, automobile, aircraft, industrial\nequipment, aerospace, aluminum and durable goods industries.\nBecause demand for our products and services is largely\nderived from the global demand for their products, we are subject to\nuncertainties related to downturns in our customers\u2019 businesses and unanticipated\nshutdowns or curtailments of our customers\u2019\nproduction, including as a result of adverse changes affecting\nnational, regional and global economies or increased competitive\npressure within our customers\u2019 industries.\nOur customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow shortages\nand\ndifficulty obtaining financing, leading them\nto delay or cancel plans to purchase products, and they may not be able to fulfill their\nobligations in a timely fashion.\nWe have limited\nability to adjust our costs contemporaneously with changes in sales; thus, a\nsignificant sudden downturn in sales due to reductions in global production\nwithin the industries we serve and/or weak end-user\nmarkets could have a material adverse effect on our\nliquidity, financial position and results\nof operations.\nFurther, our suppliers and\nother business partners may experience similar conditions, which\ncould impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us and also\nresult in material adverse effects on our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nChanges in competition in the industries and markets we serve could have\na material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial\nposition and results of operations.\nThe specialty chemical industry is highly competitive and there are\nmany companies with significant financial resources and/or\ncustomer relationships that compete with us to provide similar products\nand services.\nSome competitors may be able to offer more\nfavorable or flexible pricing and service terms or,\ndue to their larger size or greater access to resources, may be better able to adapt\nto\nchanges in conditions in our industries, fluctuations in the costs of raw materials\nor changes in global economic conditions, potentially\nresulting in reduced profitability and/or a loss of market share for us.\nThe pricing decisions of our competitors could lead us to\ndecrease our prices which could negatively affect our margins\nand profitability.\nIn addition, our competitors could potentially\nconsolidate their businesses and gain scale or better position their\nproduct offerings, which could have a negative impact on our\nprofitability and market share.\nCompetition in our industry historically has also been based on the ability\nto provide products that\nmeet the needs of the customer and render technical services and laboratory\nassistance, which our competitors may be able to\naccomplish more effectively than we are able to do.\nFurther, in connection with obtaining regulatory approval\nof the Combination, we\ndivested certain of Houghton\u2019s products\nand related assets to a competitor which they may use to compete with us in certain areas\nwhere we continue to sell those products.\nIf we are unsuccessful with differentiating ourselves, it could\nhave a material adverse effect\non our liquidity, financial\nposition and results of operations and we could lose market share to our compe\ntitors.\nLoss of a significant customer, bankruptcy\nof a major customer, or the closure of or significant\nreduction in production at a\ncustomer site could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nDuring 2021, the Company\u2019s\ntop five largest customers (each composed of multiple subsidiaries or divisions\nwith semi-\nautonomous purchasing authority) together accounted for approximately\n10% of our consolidated net sales, with the largest customer\naccounting for approximately 3% of our consolidated\nnet sales.\nThe loss of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect\non our liquidity, financial\nposition and results of operations.\nAlso, a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales to\ncustomers in the cyclical steel, aerospace, aluminum and automotive\nindustries, where bankruptcies have occurred in the past and\nwhere companies have periodically experienced financial difficulties.\nIf a significant customer experiences financial difficulties or\nfiles for bankruptcy protection, we may be unable to collect on our receivables,\nand customer manufacturing sites may be closed, or\ncontracts voided.\nThe bankruptcy of a major customer could therefore have a material adverse effect\non our liquidity, financial\nposition and results of operations.\nAlso, some of our customers, primarily in the steel, aluminum and aerospace industries, often\nhave\nfewer manufacturing locations compared to other metalworking customers\nand generally use higher volumes of products at a single\nlocation.\nThe loss, closure,\nor significant reduction in production at one or more of these locations or other major sites of\na significant\ncustomer could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\nWe may not be able\nto timely develop, manufacture and gain market acceptance of new and enhanced\nproducts required to\nmaintain or expand our business, which could adversely affect\nour competitive position and our liquidity, financial\nposition and\nresults of operations.\nWe believe that\nour continued success depends on our ability to continuously develop and manufacture\nnew products and product\nenhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis in response\nto customer demands for higher performance process chemicals and\nother product offerings.\nOur competitors may develop new products or enhancements to their products\nthat offer performance,\nfeatures and lower prices that may render our products less competitive\nor obsolete, and we may lose business and/or significant\nmarket share.\nThe development and commercialization of new products requires\nsignificant expenditures over an extended period of\ntime, and some products that we seek to develop may fail to gain traction or never\nbecome profitable.\nIn any event, ongoing\ninvestments in research and development for the future do not yield an\nimmediate beneficial impact on our operating results and\ntherefore could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues.\nIn addition, our customers use our specialty chemicals for a broad range\nof applications.\nChanges in our customers\u2019 products or\nprocesses or changes in regulatory,\nlegislative or industry requirements may lead our customers to reduce consumption\nof the specialty\nchemicals that we produce or make them unnecessary or less attractive.\nCustomers may also adopt alternative materials or processes\nthat do not require our products.\nAn example of such evolving customer demands and industry trends is the\nmovement towards light\nweighting of materials and electric vehicles.\nShould a customer decide to use a different material due to price,\nperformance or other\nconsiderations, we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer\u2019s\nnew requirements.\nConsequently, it is important\nthat\nwe develop new products to replace the products that mature and decline\nin use.\nDespite our efforts, we may not be able to develop\nand introduce products incorporating new technologies in a timely manner\nthat will satisfy our customers\u2019 future needs or achieve\nmarket acceptance.\nMoreover, new products may have lower margins\nthan the products they replace.\nOur business, results of\noperations, cash flows and margins could be materially\nadversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation\nor\nobsolescence of our existing products and the introduction of new products.\nRisks Related to Business Operations, Including Internal and External Factors\nthat May Impact Our Operational Continuity\nOur ability to profitably operate our consolidated company as anticipated\nrequires us to effectively identify and consummate the\nstrategic acquisitions we identify and to successfully integrate\nthese acquisitions into our consolidated operations.\nAn inability to\nappropriately capitalize on growth, including organic growth and future acquisitions,\ncould adversely affect our liquidity,\nfinancial\nposition and results of operations.\nWe have completed\nseveral acquisitions over the past several years as discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nAcquired companies may have significant latent liabilities that may not be\ndiscovered before they are acquired and may not be reflected in the price\nwe pay.\nAcquisitions also could have a dilutive effect on our\nfinancial results and while they generally result in goodwill, goodwill\ncould be impaired in the future resulting in a charge to earnings.\nOur ability to implement our growth strategy may be limited by our\nability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture\ncandidates, our financial resources, including available cash and\nborrowing capacity, and our ability\nto negotiate and complete suitable\narrangements.\nFurther, the success of our growth depends on our ability\nto navigate risks such as those listed above and successfully\nintegrate acquisitions, including, but not limited to, our ability to:\n\u25cf\nsuccessfully execute the integration or consolidation of the\nacquired or additional business into our existing processes and\noperations;\n\u25cf\ndevelop or modify financial reporting, information systems and other\nrelated financial tools to ensure\noverall financial\nintegrity and adequacy of internal control procedures;\n\u25cf\nidentify and take advantage of potential synergies, including\ncost reduction opportunities, while retaining legacy business and\nother related attributes;\n\u25cf\nadequately address challenges arising from the increased scope, geographic\ndiversity and complexity of our operations; and\n\u25cf\nfurther penetrate existing, and expand into new,\nmarkets with the product capabilities acquired in acquisitions.\nIf we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing business,\nour financial condition and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected.\nWe may fail to\nobtain the benefits we anticipate from our recently completed or future\nacquisitions or joint\nventures and we may not create the appropriate infrastructure to support\nsuch additional growth from organic or acquired businesses,\nwhich could also have a material adverse effect on our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nGulf and its wholly-owned subsidiary, QH Hungary\nHoldings Limited, have a significant minority stake in the Company and the\ncontractual ability to nominate certain directors of the Company,\nwhich may enable them to influence the direction of our business\nand significant corporate decisions.\nAs a result of the Combination, Gulf and its wholly-owned subsidiary,\nQH Hungary Holdings Limited (together,\nthe \u201cGulf\nAffiliates\u201d), have become our largest shareholders.\nIf they were to make available for sale a portion of their shares, that portion could\nrepresent a significant amount of common stock of the Company being sold\nwhich could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s\nstock price.\nIn addition, the Gulf Affiliates currently have the right\nto designate three individuals for election to the Board and this right,\ntogether with their share ownership, gives them substantial influence over\nour business, including over matters submitted to a vote of\nour shareholders, including the election of directors, amendment of our organizational\ndocuments, acquisitions or other business\ncombinations involving the Company,\nand potentially the ability to prevent extraordinary transactions such as a takeover\nattempt or\nbusiness combination.\nThe concentration of ownership of our shares held by the Gulf Affiliates may\nmake some future actions more\ndifficult without their support.\nThe Gulf Affiliates, however, among\nother provisions in the shareholders agreement, have agreed that\nfor so long as any of their designees are on the Board, and for six months thereafter,\nthey will vote all Quaker Houghton shares\nconsistent with the recommendations of the Board for each director nominee\nas reflected in each proxy statement of the Company,\nincluding in support of any Quaker Houghton directors nominated for election\nor re-election to the Board (except as would conflict\nwith their rights to designees on the Board).\nNevertheless, the interests of Gulf may conflict with our interests or the interests of our\nother shareholders, though we are not aware of any such existing conflicts of interest at\nthis time.\nFailure to comply with any material provision of our principal credit facility\nor other debt agreements could have a material\nadverse effect on our liquidity, financial\nposition and results of operations.\nWe significantly\nincreased our level of indebtedness in connection with the closing of\nthe Combination.\nOur principal credit\nfacility requires the Company to comply with certain provisions\nand covenants, and, while we do not currently consider these\nprovisions and covenants to be overly restrictive, they could become\nmore difficult to comply with as business or financial conditions\nchange.\nWe are also subject to\ninterest rate risk due to the variable interest rates within the credit facility and if interest rates rise\nsignificantly, these\ninterest costs would increase as well.\nOur principal credit facility contains provisions that are customary\nfor facilities of its type, including affirmative and negative\ncovenants, financial covenants and events of default, including\nrestrictions on (a) the incurrence of additional indebtedness, (b)\ninvestments in and acquisitions of other businesses, lines of business and\ndivisions, (c) the making of dividends or capital stock\npurchases and (d) dispositions of assets.\nWe may declare\ndividends and make share repurchases in annual amounts not exceeding\nthe\ngreater of $50 million annually and 20% of consolidated EBITDA (earnings\nbefore interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) if\nwe are otherwise in compliance with the credit facility and we may also distribute\ncertain other amounts to our shareholders if we\nsatisfy a consolidated net leverage ratio.\nOther financial covenants contained in our principal credit facility\ninclude a consolidated\ninterest coverage test and a consolidated net leverage test.\nCustomary events of default in the credit facility include, among others,\ndefaults for non-payment, breach of representations and warranties, non\n-performance of covenants, cross-defaults, insolvency,\nand a\nchange of control of the Company in certain circumstances.\nIf we are unable to comply with the financial and other provisions of\nour\nprincipal facility,\nwe could become in default.\nThe occurrence of an event of default under the credit facility could result in all loans\nand other obligations becoming immediately due and payable and the facility\nbeing terminated.\nIn addition, deterioration in the\nCompany\u2019s results of operations\nor financial position could significantly increase borrowing costs.\nChanges to the LIBOR calculation method or the replacement of LIBOR may have adverse\nconsequences for the Company that\ncannot yet reasonably be predicted.\nThe Company\u2019s principal\ncredit facility permits interest on certain borrowings to be calculated based on the\nLondon Interbank\nOffered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d).\nThe LIBOR benchmark has been subject of national, international, and other regulatory\nguidance and\nproposals for reform and will cease to be provided with certain rates as of December\n31, 2021 through June 30, 2023.\nIn December\n2021, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to Credit Agreement\n(\u201cSecond Amendment\u201d) with Bank of America N.A., to\nprovide an update for the use of a non-U.S. dollar (\u201cnon-USD\u201d) currency LIBOR successor\nrate.\nThe transition away from LIBOR\npresents various risks and challenges, including with respect to our borrowings\nand hedging arrangements that rely on the LIBOR\nbenchmark.\nFurther, the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result\nof the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR.\nVarious\nparties are working on industry wide and company specific transition plans\nrelated to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference\nRates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large\nU.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing LIBOR with the Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), a new index\ncalculated using short-term repurchase agreements,\nbacked by Treasury securities.\nAt this time, it remains uncertain what rate will\nsucceed LIBOR.\nIt is not possible to predict whether SOFR will attain market traction as a LIBOR replacement\nor to predict any other\nreforms to LIBOR that may be enacted.\nThe potential effect of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR on the Company\u2019s\nfinancial\nposition or results of operations cannot yet be predicted but may affect\nthe level of interest payments on our portion of indebtedness\nthat bear interest at variable rates.\nRisks Related to our International Operations\nOur global presence subjects us to political and economic risks that could adversely affect\nour business, liquidity, financial\nposition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenues and earnings are generated by our non\n-U.S. operations.\nOur success as a global business\ndepends, in part, upon our ability to succeed across different legal,\nregulatory, economic,\nsocial and political conditions by developing,\nimplementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective\nin all of the locations where we do business.\nRisks inherent in\nour global operations include:\n\u25cf\nincreased transportation and logistics costs, or restrictions on transportation\nof materials;\n\u25cf\nincreased cost or decreased availability of raw materials;\n\u25cf\ntrade protection measures including import and export controls, trade embargoes,\nand trade sanctions between countries or\nregions we serve that could result in our losing access to customers and suppliers\nin those countries or regions;\n\u25cf\nunexpected adverse changes in export duties, quotas and tariffs and\ndifficulties in obtaining export licenses;\n\u25cf\ntermination or substantial modification of international trade agreements\nthat may adversely affect our access to raw\nmaterials and to markets for our products;\n\u25cf\nour agreements with counterparties in countries outside the U.S. may\nbe difficult for us to enforce and related receivables\nmay take longer or be difficult for us to collect;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties of staffing and managing dispersed\ninternational operations;\n\u25cf\nless protective foreign intellectual property laws, and more generally,\nlegal systems that may be less developed and\npredictable than those in the U.S.;\n\u25cf\nlimitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises as well as the potential\nfor expropriation or nationalization of\nenterprises;\n\u25cf\nthe impact of widespread public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf\ninstability in or adverse changes to the economic, political, social, legal or regulatory\nconditions in a country or region where\nwe do business, including hyperinflationary conditions or as a result of\nterrorist activities, or as a result of political and/or\nmilitary conflict; and\n\u25cf\ncomplex and dynamic local tax regulations, including changes in foreign\nlaws and tax rates or U.S. laws and tax rates with\nrespect to foreign income that may unexpectedly increase the rate at which\nour income is taxed, impose new and additional\ntaxes on remittances, repatriation or other payments by subsidiaries, or\ncause the loss of previously recorded tax benefits.\nThe current global geopolitical and trade environment creates the potential\nfor increased escalation of domestic and international\ntariffs and retaliatory trade policies.\nFurther changes in U.S. trade policy and additional retaliatory\nactions by U.S. trade partners\ncould result in a worsening of economic conditions.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with\nour\ninternational businesses, the risks could have a material adverse effect\non our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, on January\n31, 2020, the United Kingdom\u2019s\n(\u201cU.K.\u201d) ended its membership in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d)\n(commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d).\nThe U.K. and the EU entered into a trade and cooperation agreement effective\nJanuary 1, 2021,\nbut uncertainty remains regarding its implications and implementation\n,\nand whether any new trade agreements with other countries or\nterritories will be agreed upon and implemented and how any such agreements\nmay impact our business.\nThe long-term economic,\nlegal, political and social implications of Brexit, including regarding\ndata protection in the U.K. and the free movement of goods,\nservices, and people between the U.K., the EU, and elsewhere, also remains\nunclear,\nand the precise impact of the Brexit decision will\nonly become clearer as Brexit progresses.\nBrexit has caused and could cause further disruptions to, and create unce\nrtainty\nsurrounding, our business in the U.K. and EU, including affecting our\nrelationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers\nand employees.\nBrexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and\nregulations as the U.K. determines\nwhich EU laws to replace or replicate.\nBrexit could also lead to calls for similar referendums in other European jurisdictions\nwhich\ncould cause increased economic volatility in the European and global markets.\nUncertainty around these and related issues could lead\nto adverse effects on the economy of the U.K. or in the other economies\nin which we operate.\nThere can be no assurance that any or\nall of these events will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nThe scope of our international operations subjects us to risks from currency fluctuations\nthat could adversely affect our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nOur non-U.S. operations generate significant revenues and\nearnings.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect\nproduct demand and may adversely affect the profitability\nin U.S. dollars of the products and services we provide in international\nmarkets where payment for our products and services is made in the local\ncurrency.\nOur financial results are affected by currency\nfluctuations, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the euro, the Brazilian\nreal, the Mexican peso, the Chinese renminbi, and the\nIndian rupee, and the impact of those currency fluctuations on the\nunderlying economies.\nDuring the past three years, sales by our\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries, which use their local currencies as their functional currency,\naccounted for approximately 60% to 70% of our\nconsolidated net sales.\nWe generally do not use\nfinancial instruments that expose us to significant risk involving foreign curren\ncy\ntransactions; however, the relative size of our non-U.S.\nactivities has a significant impact on reported operating results and our net\nassets.\nTherefore, as exchange rates change, our results can be materially\naffected.\nIncorporated by reference is the foreign exchange\nrisk information contained in Item 7A of this Report and the geographic information\nin Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nAlso, we occasionally source inventory in a different country\nthan that of the intended sale.\nThis practice can give rise to foreign\nexchange risk.\nWe seek to mitigate this risk through\nlocal sourcing of raw materials in the majority of our locations.\nRisks Relating to Our Supply Chain\nIf we are unable to obtain price increases or contract concessions sufficient to\noffset increases in the costs of raw materials, this\ncan continue to result in a loss of sales, gross profit, and/or market share and can\nhave a material adverse effect on our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nConversely, if we fail to adjust prices in a declining raw material cost environment,\nwe\ncould lose sales, gross profit, and/or market share which could have a material\nadverse effect on our liquidity, financial position\nand results of operations.\nQuaker Houghton uses approximately 3,000 different\nraw materials, including animal fats, vegetable oils, mineral oils,\noleochemicals, ethylene, solvents, surfactant agents, various chemical\ncompounds that act as additives to our base formulations, and a\nwide variety of other organic and inorganic\ncompounds, and various derivatives of the foregoing.\nThe price of mineral oils and their\nderivatives can be affected by the price of crude oil\nand industry refining capacity.\nAnimal fat and vegetable oil prices, as well as the\nprices of other\nraw materials, are impacted by their own specific supply and demand factors, as well as by\nbiodiesel consumption\nwhich is also affected by the price of crude oil.\nAccordingly, significant\nfluctuations in the price of crude oil in the past have had and\nare expected to continue to have a material impact on the cost of our raw materials.\nIn addition, many of the raw materials we use are\ncommodity chemicals, which can experience significant price volatility.\nWe generally\nattempt to pass through changes in the prices of raw materials to our customers, but we\nmay be unable to do so (or\nmay be delayed in doing so).\nIn addition, raising prices we charge to our customers\nin order to offset increases in the prices we pay\nfor raw materials could cause us to suffer a loss of sales volumes.\nAlthough we have been successful in recovering a substantial\namount of raw material cost increases while retaining our customers as experienced\nin 2021, there can be no assurance that we will be\nable to continue to offset higher raw material costs or\nretain customers in the future.\nA significant change in margin or the loss of\ncustomers due to pricing actions could result in a material adverse effect\non our liquidity, financial position\nand results of operations\nas described within Item 7 of this Report.\nLack of availability of raw materials and issues associated with sourcing from single suppliers\nand suppliers in volatile economic\nenvironments could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nThe specialty chemical industry periodically experiences supply shortages\nfor certain raw materials.\nIn addition, we source some\nmaterials from a single supplier or from suppliers in jurisdictions that have\nexperienced political or economic instability.\nEven if we\nhave multiple suppliers of a particular raw material, there are occasionally\nshortages.\nAny significant disruption in supply could affect\nour ability to obtain raw materials or satisfactory substitutes or could\nincrease the cost of such raw materials or substitutes, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, certain raw materials\nthat we use are subject to various regulatory laws, and a change in our ability to legally\nuse such raw materials may impact the\nproducts or services we are able to offer which could negatively\naffect our ability to compete and could adversely affect\nour liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nLoss of a significant manufacturing facility or disruptions within our supply\nchain or in transportation could have a material\nadverse effect on our liquidity, financial\nposition and results of operations.\nOur manufacturing facilities are located throughout the world.\nWhile we have some redundant capabilities, if one of our facilities\nis forced to shut down or curtail operations because of damage or other factors,\nincluding natural disasters, labor difficulties or\nwidespread public health crises, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,\nwe may not be able to timely supply our customers.\nThis\ncould result in a loss of sales over an extended period or permanently.\nWhile the Company seeks to mitigate this risk through business\ncontinuity and contingency planning and other measures, the loss of production\nin any one region over an extended period of time\ncould have a material adverse effect on our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, the coronavirus\npandemic has caused, and may in the future cause, significant travel disruptions,\nquarantines and/or closures, which could result in\ndisruptions to our manufacturing and production operations at our facilities,\nas well as those of our suppliers and customers.\nAny\nlosses due to these events may not be covered by our existing insurance policies\nor may be subject to certain deductibles.\nWe could be\nsimilarly adversely affected by other disruptions to our supply\nchain and transportation network.\nThe Company\nrelies heavily on railroads, ships, and over-the-road shipping\nmethods to transport raw materials to its manufacturing facilities and to\ntransport finished products to customers.\nThe costs of transporting our products could be negatively affected\nby factors outside of our\ncontrol, including shipping container shortages or global imbalances in\nshipping capabilities, transportation disruptions or rate\nincreases, increased border controls or closures, extreme weather events,\ntariffs, rising fuel costs and capacity constraints.\nSignificant\ndelays or increased costs affecting our supply chain, such as we experienced\nin 2021 could materially affect our financial condition\nand results of operations.\nDisruptions at our suppliers have recently and could in the future lead to short term or longer\nterm increases\nin raw material or energy costs and/or reduced availability of materials\nor energy,\npotentially affecting our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nRisks Relating to Domestic and Foreign Taxation\nand Government Regulation and Oversight\nChanges in tax laws could result in fluctuations in our effective tax\nrate and have a material effect on our liquidity,\nfinancial\nposition and results of operation.\nWe pay income\ntaxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions.\nOur effective tax rate is derived from a combination of local\ntax rates and tax attributes applicable to our operations in the various countries,\nstates and other jurisdictions in which we operate.\nOur effective tax rate and respective tax liabilities could therefore\nbe materially affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries\nwith differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax rates, expiration\nor lapses of tax credits or incentives, changes in uncertain tax\npositions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes\nin tax laws or in how they are interpreted or\nenforced, including matters such as transfer pricing.\nIn addition, we are regularly under audit by tax authorities, and the final\ndecisions of such audits could materially affect our current\ntax estimates and tax positions.\nSee Note 10 and Note 26 of Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for a discussion\nof certain income and non-income tax audits and\ninspections.\nAny of these factors or similar tax-related risks could cause our effective\ntax rate and tax-related payments, including any\nsuch payments related to tax liabilities of businesses we have acquired, to\nsignificantly differ from previous periods and current or\nfuture expectations which could have a material effect on our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nPending and future legal proceedings including environmental\nmatters could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations, as well as our reputation in the markets it serves.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are routinely party to proceedings, cases, and\nrequests for information from, and negotiations\nwith, various claimants and federal and state agencies relating to various\nlegal matters, including tax and environmental matters.\nSee\nNote 10 and Note 26 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item\n8 of this Report, which describes uncertain tax positions\nand tax audits and inspections, as well as certain information concerning\npending asbestos-related litigation against an inactive\nsubsidiary, amounts\naccrued associated with certain environmental, non-capital remediation costs and\nother potential commitments or\ncontingencies.\nAn adverse result in one or more pending or ongoing matters or any potential future\nmatter of a similar nature could\nmaterially and adversely affect our liquidity,\nfinancial position, and results of operations, as well as our reputation in the markets\nwe\nserve.\nFailure to comply with the complex global regulatory environment in which we operate\ncould have an adverse impact on our\nreputation and/or a material adverse effect on our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to\ngovernment regulation in all of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business.\nChanges in the regulatory\nenvironments\nin which we operate, particularly,\nbut not limited to, the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, China, India, Thailand, Australia, the\nU.K. and the EU, could lead to heightened regulatory compliance costs and\nscrutiny, could adversely\nimpact our ability to continue\nselling certain products in the U.S. or foreign markets, and/or could otherwise\nincrease the cost of doing business.\nWhile we seek to\nmitigate these risks through a variety of actions,\nincluding receiving Responsible Care Certification, ongoing employee\ntraining, and\nemploying a comprehensive environmental, health and safety program,\nthere is no guarantee these actions will prevent all potential\nregulatory compliance issues.\nFor instance, failure to comply with the EU\u2019s\nRegistration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of\nChemicals (\u201cREACH\u201d) regulations or other similar laws and regulations\ncould result in our inability to sell certain products or we\ncould incur fines, ongoing monitoring obligations or other future business consequences,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect\non our liquidity, financial\nposition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the U.S. Toxic\nSubstances Control Act (\u201cTSCA\u201d) requires\nchemicals to be assessed against a risk-based safety standard and\nthat unreasonable risks identified during risk evaluation be\neliminated.\nThis regulation and other pending initiatives at the U.S. state level, as well as initiatives\nin Canada, Asia and other\nregions, could potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of\na wide variety of chemicals, including chemicals used\nor produced by us.\nThese assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved\nand additional requirements\nbeing placed on their production, handling, labeling or use.\nThese concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost\nincurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise\nlimit their use which could lead to a decrease in demand for\nthese products.\nA decrease in demand due to these issues could have an adverse impact on our business\nand results of operation.\nFurther, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign\nCorrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d),\nthe U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery,\nanti-\ncorruption and anti-money laundering laws in jurisdictions around\nthe world.\nThese and similar laws generally prohibit companies\nand their officers, directors, employees and third-party\nintermediaries, business partners and agents, from making improper payments\nor providing other improper items of value to government officials\nor other persons.\nWhile we have policies and procedures and\ninternal controls designed to address compliance with such laws, including\nemployee training programs, we cannot guarantee that our\nemployees and third-party intermediaries, business partners\nand agents will not take, or be alleged to have taken, actions in violation\nof such policies and laws for which we may be ultimately held responsible.\nDetecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged\nviolations can be extensive and require a significant diversion of time, resources\nand attention from senior management.\nAny\nviolation of these or other applicable anti-bribery,\nanti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower\ncomplaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges,\nand criminal or civil sanctions, penalties and fines, any\nof which could adversely affect our business and financial\ncondition.\nThe shipment of goods, services and technology across international\nborders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations.\nOur import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and\nregulations in each of the countries where we operate.\nMoreover,\nmany countries, including the U.S., control the export and re-export of\ncertain goods, services and technology and impose related\nexport record-keeping and reporting obligations.\nGovernments may also impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons\nand entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such\ncountries, persons and entities, which may limit or prevent our\nconduct of business in certain jurisdictions.\nThe laws and regulations concerning import activity,\nexport record-keeping and reporting, export control and economic\nsanctions\nare complex and constantly changing.\nThese laws and regulations can cause delays in shipments and unscheduled operational\ndowntime.\nMoreover, any failure to comply with applicable legal and\nregulatory trading obligations could result in criminal and civil\npenalties and sanctions such as fines, imprisonment, debarment from governmental\ncontracts, seizure of shipments and loss of import\nand export privileges.\nIn addition, investigations by governmental authorities as well as legal, social, economic\nand political issues in\nthese countries could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are also subject\nto the risks that our employees, joint venture partners and agents outside of\nthe U.S. may fail to comply with other applicable laws.\nUncertainty related to environmental regulation and industry standards relating\nto, as well as physical risks of, climate change and\nbiodiversity loss, could impact our results of operations and financial position\n.\nIncreased public and stakeholder awareness and concern regarding global\nclimate change, biodiversity loss, and other\nenvironmental risks may result in more extensive international, regional\nand/or federal requirements or industry standards to reduce or\nmitigate the effects of these changes.\nThese regulations could mandate even more restrictive standards or industry\nstandards than the\nvoluntary goals that we have established or require changes to be adopted\non a more accelerated time frame.\nThere continues to be a\nlack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory\nuncertainty.\nThough we are closely following\ndevelopments in this area and changes in the regulatory landscape in the U.S.,\nwe cannot predict how or when those challenges may\nultimately impact our business.\nWhile certain climate change initiatives may result in new business opportunities\nfor us in the area of\nalternative fuel technologies and emissions control, compliance with\nthese initiatives may also result in additional costs to us\nincluding, among other things, increased production costs, additional\ntaxes, reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on\nproduction or operations.\nIn addition, the potential physical impacts of climate change and biodiversity\nloss are highly uncertain and will be particular to the\ncircumstances developing in various geographical regions.\nThese may include extreme weather events and long-term changes\nin\ntemperature levels and water availability as well as damaged ecosystems.\nThe physical risks of climate change and biodiversity loss\nmay impact our facilities, our customers and suppliers, and the availability\nand costs of materials and natural resources, sources and\nsupply of energy,\nproduct demand and manufacturing.\nIn particular, climate change serves as a risk multiplier\nincreasing both the\nfrequency and severity of natural disasters that may affect\nour business operations.\nIf environmental laws or regulations or industry standards are either\nchanged or adopted and impose significant operational\nrestrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, or\nour operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of climate\nchange or biodiversity loss, our business, capital expenditures, results of\noperations, financial condition and competitive position could\nbe negatively impacted.\nWe are subject to stringent labor\nand employment laws in many jurisdictions in which we operate, and\nour relationship with our\nemployees could deteriorate which could adversely impact our operations.\nA majority of our full-time employees are employed outside the U.S.\nIn many jurisdictions where we operate, labor and\nemployment laws grant significant job protection to certain employees including\nrights on termination of employment.\nIn addition, in\ncertain countries our employees are represented by works councils or are governed\nby collective bargaining agreements and we are\noften required to consult with and seek the consent or advice of such representatives\n.\nThese regulations and laws, together with our\nobligations to seek consent or consult with the relevant unions or works councils,\ncould have a significant impact on our flexibility in\nmanaging costs and responding to market changes.\nWhile the Company believes it has generally positive relations with its labor\nunions and employees, there is no guarantee the Company will be able to successfully\nnegotiate new or renew labor agreements\nwithout work stoppages, labor difficulties or unfavorable\nterms.\nIf we were to experience any extended interruption of operations at\nany of our facilities because of strikes or other work stoppages, our results of operations\nand financial condition could be materially\nand adversely affected.\nWe may be\nunable to adequately protect our proprietary rights and trade brands, which may\nlimit our ability to compete in our\nmarkets and could adversely affect our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nWe have a limited\nnumber of patents and patent applications, including patents issued, applied\nfor, or acquired in the U.S. and in\nvarious foreign countries, some of which are material to our business.\nHowever, we rely principally on our proprietary\nformulae and\nthe applications know-how and experience to meet customer needs.\nAlso, our products are identified by trademarks that are registered\nthroughout our marketing area.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary information through\npatent and trademark filings, and\nthe use of appropriate trade secret protections, it is possible that competitors\nor other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy,\nuse,\ndisclose or replicate our formulae, products, and processes.\nSimilarly, third parties\nmay assert claims against us and our customers\nand distributors alleging our products infringe upon third-party intellectual\nproperty rights.\nIn addition, the laws and/or judicial\nsystems of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture, market\nand sell our products may afford little or no effective protection\nof our proprietary technology or trade brands.\nAlso, security over our global information technology structure\nis subject to increasing\nrisks associated with cyber-crime and other related cyber-security\nthreats.\nThese potential risks to our proprietary information, trade\nbrands and other intellectual property could subject us to increased competition\nand a failure to protect, defend or enforce our\nintellectual property rights could negatively impact our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur business could be adversely affected by environmental,\nhealth and safety laws and regulations or by potential product, service\nor other related liability claims.\nThe development, manufacture and sale of specialty chemical products and\nother related services involve inherent exposure to\npotential product liability claims, service level claims, product recalls and\nrelated adverse publicity.\nSome customers have and may in\nthe future require us to represent that our products conform to certain product\nspecifications provided by them.\nAny failure to comply\nwith such specifications could result in claims or legal action against us.\nAny of the foregoing potential product or service risks could\nalso result in substantial and unexpected expenditures and affect\ncustomer confidence in our products and services, which could have\na\nmaterial adverse effect on our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, our business is subject to hazards associated with the manufacturing,\nhandling, use, storage, and transportation of\nchemical materials and products, including historical operations at our\ncurrent and former facilities.\nThese potential hazards could\ncause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to, or destruction of,\nproperty or equipment and environmental contamination or\nother environmental damage, which could have an adverse effect\non our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn the\njurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to numerous U.S. and non-U.S.\nnational, federal, state and local environmental,\nhealth and safety laws and regulations, including those governing\nthe discharge of pollutants into the air and water,\nthe management\nand disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup\nof contaminated properties.\nWe currently\nuse, and in the past have\nused, hazardous substances at many of our facilities, and we have in the past been,\nand may in the future be, subject to claims relating\nto exposure to hazardous materials.\nWe also have\ngenerated, and continue to generate, hazardous wastes at a number of our\nfacilities.\nLiabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous\nsubstances, as well as personal injury,\nproperty damages or\nnatural resource damages arising from the release of, or exposure to, such hazardous\nsubstances, may be imposed in many situations\nwithout regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault, and\nmay also be imposed jointly and severally (so that a responsible\nparty may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved, or\neven the entire loss).\nThese liabilities may also be imposed\non many different entities, including, for example,\ncurrent and prior property owners or operators, as well as entities that arranged for\nthe disposal of the hazardous substances.\nThe liabilities may be material and can be difficult to identify or quantify.\nIn addition, the\noccurrence of disruptions, shutdowns or other material operating problems\nat our facilities or those of our customers due to any of\nthese risks could adversely affect our reputation and have\na material adverse effect on our operations as a whole, including\nour results\nof operations and cash flows, both during and after the period of operational\ndifficulties.\nFurther, some of the raw materials we handle\nare subject to government regulation that affect the manufacturing\nprocesses,\nhandling, uses and applications of our products. In addition, our production\nfacilities and a number of our distribution centers require\nnumerous operating permits.\nDue to the nature of these requirements and changes in our operations, our\noperations may exceed limits\nunder permits or we may not have the proper permits to conduct our operations.\nOngoing compliance with environmental laws, regulations and permits that\nimpact registration/approval requirements,\ntransportation and storage of raw materials and finished products, and\nstorage and disposal of wastes could require us to make changes\nin manufacturing processes or product formulations and could have\na material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may\nincur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions\nand remediation costs, or experience interruptions in our\noperations, including as a result of revocation, non-renewal or modification\nof the Company\u2019s operating permits and\nrevocation of the\nCompany\u2019s product registrations,\nfor violations arising under these laws or permit requirements.\nAny such revocation, modification or\nnon-renewal may require the Company to cease or limit the manufacture\nand sale of its products at one or more of its facilities, which\nmay limit or prevent the Company\u2019s\nability to meet product demand or build new facilities and may have a material\nadverse effect on\nthe Company\u2019s business, financial position,\nresults of operations and cash flows.\nAdditional information may arise in the future\nconcerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified\nsites, and additional sites may be identified for which we are\nalleged to be liable, that could cause us to materially increase our environmental\naccrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we\ncould reasonably incur for such matters.\nIncreased compliance costs may not affect competitors in the\nsame way that they affect us\ndue to differences in product formulations, manufacturing\nlocations or other factors, and we could be at a competitive disadvantage,\nwhich might adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe could be subject\nto indemnity claims and liable for other payments relating to properties or businesses\nwe have divested.\nIn connection with the sale of certain properties and businesses, we agreed\nto indemnify the purchasers for certain types of\nmatters, including certain breaches of representations and\nwarranties, taxes and certain environmental matters.\nWith respect to\nenvironmental matters, the discovery of contamination arising\nfrom properties that we have divested may expose us to indemnity\nobligations under the sale agreements with the buyers of such properties or\ncleanup obligations and other damages under applicable\nenvironmental laws, even if we were not aware of the contamination.\nWe may not have insurance\ncoverage for such indemnity\nobligations.\nFurther, we cannot predict the nature or amount of\nany indemnity or other obligations we may have to pay the applicable\npurchaser.\nThese payments may be costly and may adversely affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nOur insurance may not fully cover all potential exposures.\nWe maintain product,\nproperty, business interruption,\ncasualty, and other general\nliability insurance, but this may not cover all\nrisks associated with the hazards of our business and these coverages\nare subject to limitations, including deductibles and coverage\nlimits.\nWe may incur\nlosses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of our insurance policies, including\nliabilities for\nenvironmental remediation.\nIn addition, from time to time, various types of insurance for companies in\nthe specialty chemical\nindustry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms and,\nin some cases, have not been available at all.\nWe are\npotentially at additional risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail.\nAdditionally, severe disruptions\nin the domestic and global\nfinancial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival\nof some of our insurers.\nFuture downgrades in the ratings of enough\ninsurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance\ncoverage and its cost.\nIn the future, we may not be able\nto obtain coverage at current levels, if at all, and our premiums may increase\nsignificantly on coverage that we maintain.\nImpairment evaluations of goodwill, intangible assets, investments or other long-lived\nassets could result in a reduction in our\nrecorded asset values which could have a material adverse effect\non our financial position and results of operation.\nWe perform\nreviews of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual\nbasis, or more frequently if triggering events\nindicate a possible impairment.\nWe test goodwill\nat the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the\nreporting unit, including goodwill, to the reporting unit's fair value.\nSimilarly, we test indefinite-lived\nintangible assets by comparing\nthe fair value of the assets to their carrying values.\nIf the carrying values of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed\ntheir\nfair value, the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets would be considered\nimpaired.\nIn addition, we perform a review of a\ndefinite-lived intangible asset or other long-lived asset when changes\nin circumstances or events indicate a possible impairment.\nIf\nany impairment or related charge is warranted, then our\nfinancial position and results of operations could be materially affected.\nSee\nNote 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8\nof this Report.\nDisruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security\nof our systems could adversely affect our business\nand our customer relationships and subject us to fines or other regulatory actions.\nWe rely on\ninformation technology systems to obtain, process, analyze, manage, transmit, and\nstore electronic information in our\nday-to-day operations.\nWe also rely\non our technology infrastructure in all aspects of our business, including to interact with\ncustomers and suppliers, fulfill orders and bill, collect and make payments,\nship products, provide support to customers, and fulfill\ncontractual obligations.\nOur information technology systems are subject to potential disruptions,\nincluding significant network or\npower outages, cyberattacks, computer viruses, other malicious codes,\nand/or unauthorized access attempts, any of which, if\nsuccessful, could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our\nconfidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations.\nSecurity breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential\ninformation or personal data belonging to our employees,\npartners, customers or suppliers for which we may incur liability.\nCybersecurity threats, attempted intrusions and other incidents, such\nas these, are becoming more sophisticated and frequent.\nSecurity breaches and cyber incidents have, from time to time, occurred and\nmay occur in the future.\nAlthough the breaches and cyber incidents experienced\nto date have not had a material impact, there can be\nno assurance that our protective measures will prevent security breaches\nthat could have a significant impact on our business,\nreputation and financial results.\nWe are subject to\nthe data privacy and protection laws and regulations adopted by federal, state and\nforeign legislatures and\ngovernmental agencies in various countries in which we operate, including\nthe EU General Data Protection Regulation.\nImplementing\nand complying with these laws and regulations may be more costly or\ntake longer than we anticipate or could otherwise affect our\nbusiness operations.\nBreaches, cyber incidents and disruptions, or failure to comply with\nlaws and regulations related to information security or\nprivacy could result in legal claims or proceedings against us by governmental\nentities or individuals, significant fines, penalties or\njudgements, disruption of our operations, remediation requirements,\nchanges to our business practices, and damage to our reputation.\nTherefore, a failure to monitor, maintain\nor protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively\nor to anticipate,\nplan for and recover from significant disruptions to these systems could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of\noperations or financial condition.\nOur business depends on attracting and retaining qualified management\nand other key personnel.\nDue to the specialized and technical nature of our business, our future performance\nis dependent on our ability to attract, develop\nand retain qualified management, commercial, technical, and\nother key personnel.\nCompetition for such personnel is intense, and we\nmay be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel.\nIn an effort to mitigate such risks, the Company utilizes retention\nbonuses, offers competitive pay and maintains continuous\nsuccession planning, including for our senior executive officers.\nHowever,\nthere can be no assurance that these mitigating factors will be adequate to attract\nor retain qualified management or other key\npersonnel.\nFailure to retain key employees,\nfailure to successfully transition key roles, or the inability to hire, train, retain and\nmanage\nqualified personnel could also adversely affect our business\n.\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect\nto our ESG practices may impose additional costs\non us or expose us to new or additional risks.\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from\nstakeholders related to their ESG practices.\nInvestor\nadvocacy groups, institutional investors, investment funds, and\nother influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG\npractices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on\nthe implications and social cost of their investments.\nRegardless of\nthe industry, investors\u2019\nincreased focus and activism related to ESG and similar matters may impact access to\ncapital, as investors may\ndecide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of\na company\u2019s ESG practices.\nWe face pressures\nfrom certain stakeholders to prioritize and promote sustainable\npractices and reduce our carbon footprint.\nOur\nstakeholders may pressure us to implement ESG procedures or standards\nbeyond those we have in place in order to continue engaging\nwith us, to remain invested in us, or before they will make further investments\nin us.\nAdditionally, we may\nface reputational\nchallenges in the event our ESG procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by\ncertain constituencies.\nWe have adopted\ncertain practices as highlighted in the Company\u2019s\nSustainability Report, including with respect to environmental stewardship.\nFurther, as we work to align with the recommendations\nof the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task\nForce on Climate-related Financial\nDisclosures and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, we\ncontinue to expand our disclosures in these areas.\nThis is\nconsistent with our commitment to executing on a strategy that reflects the\neconomic, social, and environmental impact we have on\nthe world while advancing and complementing our business strategy.\nOur disclosures on these matters and standards we set for\nourselves or a failure to meet these standards, may influence our\nreputation and the value of our brand.\nIt is possible that our\nstakeholders might not be satisfied with our ESG efforts or\nthe speed of their adoption.\nIf we do not meet our stakeholders\u2019\nexpectations, our business and/or our ability to access capital could be\nharmed.\nAny harm to our reputation resulting from setting\nthese standards or our failure or perceived failure to meet such standards\ncould adversely affect our business, financial performance,\nand growth.\nAdditionally, adverse\neffects upon our customers\u2019 industries related to the worldwide social and\npolitical environment, including\nuncertainty or instability resulting from climate change or biodiversity\nloss, changes in political leadership and environmental policies,\nchanges in geopolitical-social views toward fossil fuels and renewable\nenergy,\nconcern about the environmental impact of climate\nchange or biodiversity loss, and investors\u2019 expectations regarding\nESG matters, may also adversely affect demand for our services.\nAny long-term material adverse effect on our customers\nor their industries could have a significant financial and operational adverse\nimpact on our business.\nTerrorist\nattacks, other acts of violence or war,\nnatural disasters, widespread public health crises or other uncommon\nglobal events\nmay affect the markets in which we operate and our profitability which could\nadversely affect our liquidity, financial\nposition and\nresults of operations.\nTerrorist attacks,\nother acts of violence or war, natural disasters, widespread\npublic health crises, including the ongoing COVID-\n19 pandemic, or other uncommon global events such as the current conflict\nbetween Russia and Ukraine, may negatively affect our\noperations.\nThere can be no assurance that there will not be terrorist attacks against the U.S. or other locations\nwhere we do business.\nAlso, other uncommon global events such as earthquakes, hurricanes,\nfires and tsunamis cannot be predicted.\nTerrorist attacks,\nother acts of violence\nor armed conflicts, and natural disasters, which may be amplified by ongoing global\nclimate change and biodiversity loss, may directly impact our physical\nfacilities and/or those of our suppliers or customers.\nIn\naddition, terrorist attacks or natural disasters may disrupt the global\ninsurance and reinsurance industries with the result that we may\nnot be able to obtain insurance at historical terms and levels, if at all, for\nall of our facilities.\nIn addition, available insurance coverage\nmay not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or,\nif available, may be prohibitively expensive.\nWidespread public health\ncrises could also disrupt operations of the Company,\nits suppliers and customers which could have a material adverse impact on our\nresults of operations.\nThe consequences of terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or armed\nconflicts, natural disasters, widespread public health crises\nor other uncommon global events can be unpredictable, and we may not be\nable to foresee or effectively plan for these events,\nresulting in a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations or financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on business and economic conditions\nhave negatively affected our business, results of\noperations and financial condition and the extent and duration of\nthose effects is uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic that began in the first quarter of 2020 and the resulting\nimpacts significantly disrupted the global\neconomy and financial markets and adversely affected\nthe Company\u2019s operations as well as those of\nits suppliers and customers.\nThe\nCompany experienced material disruptions as a result of COVID-19 globally\nwhich negatively impacted all locations where the\nCompany does business.\nAlthough the Company has now operated in this COVID-19 environment\nfor almost two years, the full extent of the outbreak and\nrelated business impacts continue to remain uncertain and volatile.\nThis outbreak has significantly disrupted the operations of the\nCompany and those of its suppliers and customers.\nDuring the pandemic, the Company initially experienced volume declines and\nlower net sales as compared to pre-COVID-19 levels.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and responses to the pandemic have at\ntimes significantly disrupted the global supply chain and have had\na significant impact on raw material prices.\nThese impacts may\ncontinue to occur and may become more significant and could continue\nto result in disruptions in our supply chain and our difficulty\nin procuring or inability to procure raw materials necessary for the manufacturing\nof our products.\nThe impact of the COVID-19\npandemic and responses to it has increased and could continue to increase\nthe costs of making and distributing our products or result\nin delays in delivering, or an inability to deliver,\nthem to our customers.\nGiven the continuously evolving developments with respect to this pandemic,\nthe Company cannot, as of the date of this Report,\nreasonably estimate the magnitude or the full extent of the impact to its future results of\noperations or to the ability of it or its\ncustomers to resume more normal operations, even as certain restrictions are\nlifted.\nThe prolonged pandemic and resurgences of the\noutbreak including as new variants continue to emerge,\nand continued restrictions on day-to-day life and business operations as well as\nincreased border controls or closures and transportation disruptions,\nmay result in volume declines and lower net sales in future\nperiods.\nTo the extent\nthat the Company\u2019s customers and suppliers continue\nto be significantly and adversely impacted by COVID-19, this\ncould reduce the availability,\nor result in delays, of materials or supplies to or from the Company,\nwhich in turn could significantly\ninterrupt the Company\u2019s business operations.\nGiven this ongoing uncertainty,\nthe Company cautions that its future results of\noperations could be significantly adversely impacted by COVID-19.\nFurther, management continued to evaluate how\nCOVID-19\nrelated circumstances, such as remote work arrangements, illness or staffing\nshortages and travel restrictions have affected financial\nreporting processes and systems, internal control over financial reporting,\nand disclosure controls and procedures.\nWhile the\ncircumstances have presented and are expected to continue to present challenges,\nand have necessitated additional time and resources\nto be deployed to sufficiently address the challenges\nbrought on by the pandemic, at this time, management does not believe that\nCOVID-19 has had a material impact on financial reporting processes, internal\ncontrols over financial reporting, or disclosure controls\nand procedures.\nAlthough we have implemented business continuity and emergency\nresponse plans as well as health and safety measures to\npermit us to continue to provide services and products to customers and support\nour operations, there can be no assurance that the\ncontinued spread of COVID-19 and its variants and efforts to\ncontain the virus (including, but not limited to, vaccines and treatments,\nvoluntary and mandatory quarantines, restrictions on travel, limiting\ngatherings of people, reduced operations and extended closures of\nmany businesses and institutions) will not further impact our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nHowever, given\nthe unprecedented and continually evolving developments\nwith respect to this pandemic, the Company cannot, as of the date of this\nReport, reasonably estimate with certainty the full extent of the impact to\nits future results of operations or to the ability of it or its\ncustomers to resume more normal operations.\nA further prolonged outbreak or resurgence and period of continued\nrestrictions on day-\nto-day life and business operations would likely result in volume declines\nand lower net sales in future periods as well.\nThe ultimate significance of COVID-19 impacts on our business will depend\non, among other things, the extent and duration of\nthe pandemic, the severity of the disease and the number of people infected\nwith the virus, the development and continued uncertainty\nregarding availability,\ncontinued administration and long-term efficacy of vaccines or\nother treatments, including on new strains or\nmutations of the virus, the longer-term effects\non the economy, including\nmarket volatility, and the measures\ntaken by governmental\nauthorities and other third parties restricting day-to-day life and\nthe length of time that such measures remain in place, as well as laws\nand other governmental programs implemented to address the pandemic\nor assist impacted businesses, such as fiscal stimulus and\nother legislation designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief.\nEpidemic diseases could negatively affect various aspects of\nour business, make it more difficult to meet our obligations to our\ncustomers, and could result in reduced demand from our customers.\nThese could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects\nof a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, similar to the COVID-19\npandemic.\nA significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread\nhealth crisis that could\nadversely affect the economies and financial markets of many\ncountries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand\nfor our products and likely impact our operating results.\nTo the extent that\nthe Company\u2019s customers and\nsuppliers are materially and\nadversely impacted by a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, this could\nreduce the availability, or\nresult in delays, of materials\nor supplies to or from the Company,\nwhich in turn could materially interrupt the Company\u2019s\nbusiness operations.\nThe ultimate impact on our business of a widespread outbreak of a contagious disease will depend\non, among other things, the\nextent and duration of the outbreak,\nthe severity of the disease and the number of people infected, the development\nand continued\nuncertainty regarding availability,\nadministration and long-term efficacy of a vaccine or other\ntreatments, the longer-term effects on\nthe economy, including\nmarket volatility, and\nthe measures taken by governmental authorities and other third parties restricting day-\nto-day life and the length of time that such measures remain in place, as well as laws and\nother governmental programs implemented\nto address the outbreak or assist impacted businesses, such as fiscal stimulus and\nother legislation designed to deliver monetary aid\nand other relief.\nWe have previously identified\nmaterial weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that could have\nresulted in\nmaterial misstatements in our financial statements and in the inability of our independent\nregistered public accounting firm to\nprovide an unqualified audit opinion which could have a material adverse effect\non us.\nAs a public company,\nwe are required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing\nSections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require management to certify\nfinancial and other information in our quarterly and\nannual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness\nof controls over financial reporting.\nAs disclosed under \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\u201d of this Report, during\nthe course of preparing our audited financial\nstatements for the Company\u2019s annual\nreport on Form 10-K for 2019 and 2020, we, in conjunction with our independent registered\npublic accounting firm, identified certain material weaknesses.\nA material weakness is a deficiency,\nor combination of deficiencies, in\ninternal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility\nthat a material misstatement of annual or interim\nfinancial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nDuring 2020 and 2021, the Company dedicated multiple internal resources\nand supplemented those internal resources with\nvarious third-party specialists to assist with the formalization of\na robust and detailed remediation plan.\nIn undertaking remediation\nactivities, the Company has established a global network of personnel\nto assist local management in understanding control\nperformance and documentation requirements.\nIn order to sustain this network, the Company conducts periodic trainings and hosts\ndiscussions to address questions on a current basis.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company has remediated all of the previously\nidentified material weaknesses and concluded that the Company\u2019s\ninternal control over financial reporting is effective.\nOur Management, including our chief executive officer\nand chief financial officer, does not expect\nthat our internal control over\nfinancial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud.\nA control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide\nonly\nreasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s\nobjectives will be met.\nFurther, the design of a control system must\nreflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of\ncontrols must be considered relative to their costs.\nControls can\nbe circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or\nmore people, or by management override of the\ncontrols.\nOver time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in circumstances or deterioration\nin the degree of\ncompliance with policies or procedures may occur.\nBecause of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control\nsystem,\nmisstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.", "PERMNO": 64929, "SIC": 2990, "TIC": "KWR"}
