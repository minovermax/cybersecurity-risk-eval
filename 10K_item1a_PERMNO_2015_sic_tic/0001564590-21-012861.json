These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones affecting the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that Management is not aware of or focused on or that Management currently deems immaterial may also affect the Company\u2019s business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. If any one or more of the following risks actually occur, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Outbreak\nThe economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant economic dislocation in the United States as many state and local governments have placed restrictions on businesses and residents. This resulted in a slow-down in economic activity and a related increase in unemployment and bank stocks have significantly declined in value. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Federal Reserve reduced the benchmark fed funds rate to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, and the yields on 10- and 30-year treasury notes have declined to historic lows. Various state governments and federal agencies are requiring lenders to provide forbearance and other relief to borrowers (e.g., waiving late payment and other fees). The federal banking agencies have encouraged financial institutions to prudently work with affected borrowers and passed legislation to provide relief from reporting loan classifications due to modifications related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Certain industries have been particularly hard-hit, including the travel and hospitality industry, the restaurant industry and the retail industry. Finally, the spread of the coronavirus has caused us to modify our business practices, including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences. We have many employees working remotely and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including when the coronavirus can be controlled and abated resulting in a meaningful increase in economic activity. As the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences, we could be subject to any of the following risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations:\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and services may decline, making it difficult to grow assets and income;\n\u2022\nif the economy is unable to substantially reopen, and high levels of unemployment continue for an extended period of time, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charge-offs and reduced income;\n\u2022\ncollateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase;\n\u2022\nour allowance for loan losses may have to be increased if borrowers experience financial difficulties beyond forbearance periods, which will adversely affect our net income;\n\u2022\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us;\n\u2022\nas the result of the decline in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s target federal funds rate, the yield on our assets may decline to a greater extent than the decline in our cost of interest-bearing liabilities, reducing our net interest margin and spread and reducing net income;\n\u2022\na material decrease in net income or a net loss over several quarters could result in a decrease in the elimination of or decline in the rate of our quarterly cash dividend;\n\u2022\nour wealth management revenues may decline with outstanding market turmoil;\n\u2022\nour cyber security risks are increased as the result of an increase in the number of employees working remotely;\n\u2022\nwe rely on third party vendors for certain services and the unavailability of a critical service due to the COVID-19 outbreak could have an adverse effect on us;\n\u2022\nwe face litigation, regulatory, enforcement and reputation risk as a result of our participation in the PPP and the risk that the Small Business Administration may not fund some or all of our PPP loan guaranties; and\n\u2022\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums may increase if the agency experience additional resolution costs.\nMoreover, our future success and profitability substantially depends on the management skills of our executive officers and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with us for many years. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees due to the outbreak could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy. We may not be successful in finding and integrating suitable replacements in the event of key employee loss or unavailability.\nRisks Relating to Regulatory Matters\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act has and may continue to adversely affect our business activities, financial position and profitability by increasing our regulatory compliance burden and associated costs, placing restrictions on certain products and services, and limiting our future capital raising strategies.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has and may continue to increase our regulatory compliance burden. Among the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s significant regulatory changes, it created the CFPB which is empowered to promulgate new consumer protection regulations and revise existing regulations in many areas of consumer protection. The CFPB has exclusive authority to issue regulations, orders and guidance to administer and implement the objectives of federal consumer protection laws. Moreover, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and state attorney generals may enforce consumer protection rules issued by the CFPB. The CFPB and these other changes have increased, and may continue to increase, our regulatory compliance burden and costs and may restrict the financial products and services we offer to our clients.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also increased regulation of derivatives and hedging transactions, which could limit our ability to enter into, or increase the costs associated with, interest rate and other hedging transactions.\nGovernment regulation significantly affects our business.\nThe banking industry is extensively regulated. Banking regulations are intended primarily to protect depositors, and the FDIC deposit insurance fund, not the shareholders of the Company. We are subject to regulation and supervision by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance and the Federal Reserve Bank. Regulatory requirements affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth. The bank regulatory agencies possess broad authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and regulatory practices affecting the banking industry may limit the manner in which we conduct our business. Such changes may adversely affect us, including our ability to offer new products and services, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory spreads and may impose additional costs on us.\nThe Bank is also subject to a number of Federal laws, which, among other things, require it to lend to various sectors of the economy and population, and establish and maintain comprehensive programs relating to anti-money laundering and customer identification. The Bank's compliance with these laws will be considered by the Federal banking regulators when reviewing bank merger and bank holding company acquisitions or commencing new activities or making new investments in reliance on the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. As a public company, we are also\nsubject to the corporate governance standards set forth in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as any rules or regulations promulgated by the SEC or the NASDAQ Stock Market.\nRisks Related to Economic Matters\nNegative developments in the financial services industry and U.S. and global credit markets may adversely impact our operations and results.\nOur businesses and operations, which primarily consist of lending money, borrowing money from clients in the form of deposits and investing in securities, are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. If the U.S. economy weakens, our growth and profitability from our lending, deposit and investment operations could be constrained. Uncertainty about the federal fiscal policymaking process and the medium and long-term fiscal outlook of the federal government is a concern for businesses, consumers and investors in the United States. In addition, economic conditions in foreign countries could affect the stability of global financial markets, which could hinder U.S. economic growth. Weak economic conditions are often characterized by deflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, a lack of liquidity and/or depressed prices in the secondary market for mortgage loans, increased delinquencies on mortgage, consumer and commercial loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity.\nOur business is also significantly affected by monetary and related policies of the U.S. federal government and its agencies. Changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond our control. Adverse economic conditions and government policy responses to such conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are more sensitive than our more geographically diversified competitors to adverse changes in the local economy.\nUnlike larger regional banks that operate in large geographies, much of our business is with clients located within Central and Northern New Jersey, as well as New York City. Our business loans are generally made to small to mid-sized businesses, most of whose success depends on the regional economy. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. Because of our geographic concentration, a downturn in the local economy could make it more difficult to attract deposits and could cause higher losses and delinquencies on our loans than if the loans were more geographically diversified. Adverse economic and business conditions in our market area could reduce our growth rate, affect our borrowers' ability to repay their loans and, consequently, adversely affect our financial condition and performance. Further, we place substantial reliance on real estate as collateral for our loan portfolio. A sharp downturn in real estate values in our market area could leave many of our loans under-secured, which could adversely affect our earnings.\nRisks Related to Lending Matters\nOur exposure to credit risk could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nThere are certain risks inherent in making loans, including risks that the principal of or interest on the loan will not be repaid timely or at all or that the value of any collateral securing the loan will be insufficient to cover our outstanding exposure. These risks may be affected by the strength of the borrower\u2019s business and local, regional and national market and economic conditions. Our risk management practices, such as monitoring the concentration of our loans within specific industries and our credit approval practices, may not adequately reduce credit risk, and our credit administration personnel, policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting clients and the quality of the loan portfolio. Finally, many of our loans are made to small and medium-sized businesses that are less able to withstand competitive, economic and financial pressures than larger borrowers. A failure to effectively measure and limit the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings would decrease.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses based on, among other things, the level of non-performing loans, loan growth and composition, national and regional economic conditions, historical loss experience, delinquency trends and various quantitative and qualitative factors. However, we cannot predict loan losses with certainty and we cannot assure you that charge-offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review our allowance for loan losses or\ndelinquency trends and may require additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination. Factors that require an increase in our allowance for loan losses could reduce our earnings.\nOur commercial real estate loan and commercial C&I portfolios expose us to risks that may be greater than the risks related to our other mortgage loans.\nOur loan portfolio includes non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans for individuals and businesses for various purposes. The repayment of these loans typically depends upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. This may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. These loans expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans typically cannot be liquidated as easily as residential real estate. If we foreclose on these loans, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than for a single or multifamily residential property because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Additionally, non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans generally involve relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Accordingly, charge-offs on non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our residential or consumer loan portfolios. Unexpected deterioration in the credit quality of our commercial real estate loan portfolio would require us to increase our provision for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe source of repayment of C&I loans is typically the cash flows of the borrowers\u2019 businesses. These loans may involve greater risk because the availability of funds to repay each loan depends substantially on the success of the business itself. The collateral securing the loans and leases often depreciates over time, is difficult to appraise and liquidate and fluctuates in value based on the success of the business. In addition, many commercial business loans have a variable rate which is indexed off of a floating rate such as Prime or the London Interbank Offer Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). If interest rates rise, the borrower's debt service requirement may increase, negatively impacting the borrower's ability to service their debt.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities.\nIn the course of our business, we may purchase real estate or foreclose on and take title to real estate. As a result, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation or clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. Any significant environmental liabilities could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Accounting Matters\nThe required change in how the Company recognizes credit losses and may have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the Financial Standards Accounting Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued an accounting standard update, \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which replaces the current \u201cincurred loss\u201d model for recognizing credit losses with an \u201cexpected loss\u201d model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (\"CECL\") model. Under the CECL model, the Company will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \u201cincurred loss\u201d model required under current generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. The adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how the Company determines the allowance for loan losses and could require the Company to significantly increase our allowance. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for loan losses.\nRisks Related to Interest Rate Sensitivity\nChanges in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nOur net income depends primarily upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on loans, investments and other interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowed funds.\nDifferent types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to changes in market interest rates. We expect that we will periodically experience \u201cgaps\u201d in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities. That means either our interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets, or vice versa. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest-earning assets, an increase in market rates of interest could reduce our net interest income. Likewise, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce our net interest income. We are unable to predict changes in market interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond our control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, governmental policy, domestic and international events and changes in the United States and other financial markets.\nOther Risks Related to Our Business\nWe are exposed to the risks of public health issues, natural disasters, severe weather, acts of terrorism, and other potential external events.\nWe are exposed to the risks of public health issues, natural disasters, severe weather, acts of terrorism, and other potential external events, any of which could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business. In addition, such events could: impair the ability of borrowers to qualify for loans and/or repay their obligations, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause depositors to withdraw funds, cause wealth management clients to withdraw assets under management, and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. Further, any of these events could affect the financial markets in general, causing a diminishment in market value of assets under management for our wealth management clients and/or cause a yield curve not advantageous to the Company or the banking industry in general. Any of the above could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and/or results of operations.\nUncertainty surrounding the future of LIBOR may affect the fair value and return on the Corporation's financial instruments that use LIBOR as a reference rate.\nThe Corporation holds assets, liabilities, and derivatives that are indexed to the various tenors of LIBOR. The LIBOR yield curve is also utilized in our fair value calculation. The reform of major interest benchmarks led to the announcement of the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, the regulator of the LIBOR index, that LIBOR would not be supported in its current form after the end of 2021, which has been extended until June 30, 2020. The Corporation believes the U.S. financial sector will maintain an orderly and smooth transition to new interest rate benchmarks of which the Corporation will evaluate and adopt if appropriate. While in the U.S., the Alternative Rates Committee of the FRB and Federal Reserve Bank of New York have identified the Secured Overnight Financial Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as an alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rate, it is too early to predict the financial impact this rate index replacement may have, if at all.\nRisks Related to Capital\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available when needed or available on acceptable terms.\nThe Company is required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support its operations. The Company may at some point need to raise additional capital to support continued growth. The Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside the Company\u2019s control, and on its financial performance. Accordingly, the Company cannot be assured of its ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company cannot raise additional capital when needed, the ability to further expand its operations could be materially impaired. Further, if we raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock, it would dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders and may dilute the per share book value of our common stock. New\ninvestors may also have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our current shareholders, which may adversely impact our current shareholders.\nWe are subject to certain capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, require us to raise additional capital, or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nA financial institution, such as the Bank, is subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the required amounts. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets. See Part I, Item1, \u201cBusiness - Capital Requirements.\u201d\nOur ability to pay dividends to our common shareholders is limited by law.\nSince the principal source of income for the Company is dividends paid to the Company by the Bank, the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders will depend on whether the Bank pays dividends to it. As a practical matter, restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends act as restrictions on the amount of funds available for the payment of dividends by the Company. As a New Jersey-chartered commercial bank, the Bank is subject to the restrictions on the payment of dividends contained in the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948, as amended. Under the Banking Act, the Bank may pay dividends only out of retained earnings, and out of surplus to the extent that surplus exceeds 50 percent of stated capital. The Company is also subject to FRB policies, which may, in certain circumstances, limit its ability to pay dividends. The FRB policies require, among other things, that a bank holding company maintain a minimum capital base and the FRB in supervisory guidance has cautioned bank holding companies about paying out too much of their earnings in dividends and has stated that banks should not pay out more in dividends than they earn. The FRB would most likely seek to prohibit any dividend payment that would reduce a holding company's capital below these minimum amounts.\nRisks Related to Liquidity\nLimits on our ability to use brokered deposits as part of our funding strategy may adversely affect our ability to grow.\nA \u201cbrokered deposit\u201d is any deposit that is obtained from or through the mediation or assistance of a deposit broker, which includes larger correspondent banks and securities brokerage firms. These deposit brokers attract deposits from individuals and companies throughout the country and internationally whose deposit decisions are based almost exclusively on obtaining the highest interest rates. At December 31, 2020, brokered deposits represented approximately 5.0 percent of our total deposits and equaled $213.7 million, comprised of the following: interest-bearing demand-brokered of $180.0 million, and brokered certificates of deposits of $33.7 million. To continue to maintain our level of brokered deposits, we may be forced to pay higher interest rates than contemplated by our asset-liability pricing strategy. In addition, banks that become less than \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under applicable regulatory capital requirements may be restricted in their ability to accept or prohibited from accepting brokered deposits. If this funding source becomes more difficult or expensive to access, we will have to seek alternative funding sources in order to continue to fund our growth. This may include increasing our reliance on Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, attempting to attract non-brokered deposits, reducing our available for sale securities portfolio and selling loans. There can be no assurance that brokered deposits will be available, or if available, sufficient to support our continued growth.\nWe may lose lower-cost funding sources.\nChecking, savings, and money market deposit account balances and other forms of client deposits can decrease when clients perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. If clients move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, we would lose a relatively low-cost source of funds and have to replace them with higher cost funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income. The Bank does have certain deposits with high dollar balances which are subject to volatility. Customers with large average deposits may move these deposits for operational needs, investment\nopportunities or other reasons which could require the Bank to pay higher interest rates to retain these deposits or use higher rate borrowings as an alternative funding source.\nRisks Related to Competition\nCompetition from other financial institutions in originating loans and attracting deposits may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe face substantial competition in originating loans from other banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking companies and other lenders. Many of our competitors enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources and higher lending limits, a wider geographic presence, and more accessible branch office locations.\nIn attracting deposits, we face substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks, savings institutions and credit unions, as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives, including money market funds. Many of our competitors enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources, more aggressive marketing campaigns, better brand recognition and more branch locations. These competitors may offer higher interest rates than we do, which could decrease the deposits that we attract or require us to increase our rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits.\nWe also compete with non-bank providers of financial services, such as brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, insurance companies and governmental organizations, which may offer more favorable terms. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern our operations. As a result, such non-bank competitors may have advantages over us in providing certain products and services. This competition may reduce or limit our margins on banking services, reduce our market share and adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Operational Matters\nCyber-attacks and information security breaches could compromise our information or result in the data of our customers being improperly divulged, which could expose us to liability and losses.\nMany financial institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported significant breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. Although we have not experienced, to date, any material losses relating to such cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Additionally, our risk exposure to security matters may remain elevated or increase in the future due to, among other things, the increasing size and prominence of the Company in the financial services industry, our expansion of Internet and mobile banking tools and products based on customer needs. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses, customers or third parties, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers or third parties use to access our products and services could result in customer attrition, financial losses, the inability of our customers or vendors to transact business with us, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur information technology systems and the systems of third parties upon which we rely may experience a failure, interruption or breach in security that could negatively affect our operations and reputation.\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems to conduct our business, including the systems of third-party service providers. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management and general ledger, deposit, loan, and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the impact of any failure, interruption, or breach in our security systems (including privacy and cyber-attacks), there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. Information security and cyber-security risks have increased significantly in recent years because of new technologies, the use of the Internet and other electronic delivery channels (including mobile devices) to conduct financial transactions. Accordingly, we may be\nrequired to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or exposures. The occurrence of any system failures, interruptions, or breaches in security could expose us to reputation risk, litigation, regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to successfully keep pace with technological changes could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve clients and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our clients. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to operational risk.\nWe face the risk that the design of our controls and procedures, including those to mitigate the risk of fraud by employees or outsiders, may prove to be inadequate or are circumvented, thereby causing delays in the detection of errors or inaccuracies in data and information. Management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects.\nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. There is intense competition in the financial services industry for qualified employees. In addition, we face increasing competition with businesses outside the financial services industry for the most highly skilled individuals. Our business operations could be adversely affected if we were unable to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees.\nRisks Related to Our Wealth Management Business\nRevenues and profitability from our wealth management business may be adversely affected by any reduction in assets under management, which could reduce fees earned.\nThe wealth management business derives the majority of its revenue from non-interest income, which consists of trust, investment advisory and other servicing fees. Substantial revenues are generated from investment management contracts with clients. Under these contracts, the investment advisory fees paid to us are typically based on the market value of assets under management. Assets under management may decline for various reasons including declines in the market value of the assets, which could be caused by price declines in the securities markets. Assets under management may also decrease due to redemptions and other withdrawals by clients or termination of contracts. This could be in response to adverse market conditions or in pursuit of other investment opportunities. If the assets under management we supervise decline and there is a related decrease in fees, it will negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain wealth management clients.\nDue to strong competition, our wealth management business may not be able to attract and retain clients. Competition is strong because there are numerous well-established and successful investment management and wealth advisory firms including commercial banks and trust companies, investment advisory firms, mutual fund companies, stock brokerage firms, and other financial companies. Many of our competitors have greater resources than we have. Our ability to successfully attract and retain wealth management clients is dependent upon our ability\nto compete with competitors\u2019 investment products, level of investment performance, client services and marketing and distribution capabilities. If we are not successful, our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted.\nThe wealth management industry is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by regulators, and any enforcement action or adverse changes in the laws or regulations governing our business could decrease our revenues and profitability.\nThe wealth management business is subject to regulation by a number of regulatory agencies that are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of customers participating in those markets. In the event of non-compliance with regulation, governmental regulators, including the SEC, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, may institute administrative or judicial proceedings that may result in censure, fines, civil penalties, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or the deregistration or suspension of the non-compliant broker-dealer or investment adviser or other adverse consequences. The imposition of any such penalties or orders could have a material adverse effect on the wealth management segment's operating results and financial condition. We may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations. Regulatory changes have imposed and may continue to impose additional costs, which could adversely impact our profitability.", "PERMNO": 88820, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PGC"}
