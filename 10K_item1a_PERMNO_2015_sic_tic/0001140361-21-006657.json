The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Company are described below. Any of the following risks could affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations and could be material and/or adverse in nature. You should consider all of the following risks together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nThe ongoing coronavirus pandemic is adversely impacting the Company and our customers, counterparties, employees and third-party service providers. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an economic recession and disruptions in the U.S. economy and may disrupt banking and other financial activity in the areas in which the Company operates and the adverse impacts on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects could be significant.\nThe Company\u2019s business is dependent upon the willingness and ability of our employees and customers to conduct banking and other financial transactions. The COVID-19 global public health crisis and the corresponding governmental response have resulted in widespread volatility, severe disruptions in the U.S. economy at large, operational difficulty for many small businesses, and deterioration in household, business, economic and market conditions. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related responses on our capital, liquidity and other financial positions and on our business, results of operations and prospects will depend on a number of evolving factors, including:\n\u25cf The duration, extent, and severity of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic does not yet appear to be contained and could affect significantly more households and businesses. The duration and level of severity of the pandemic continue to be unpredictable.\n\u25cf The impact on our employees. While we have not experienced a significant impact on the availability of our employees to date, our colleagues remain at risk of being exposed to COVID-19. We have taken meaningful steps and precautions to ensure their health and well-being; however, COVID-19 could still impact our colleagues\u2019 availability to work due to illness, quarantines, government actions, financial center closures or other reasons. If our employees are not able to work as effectively or a substantial number of employees are unable to work due to COVID-19, our business would be adversely affected.\n\u25cf The effects on our customers, counterparties, employees and third-party service providers. COVID-19 and its associated consequences and uncertainties may affect individuals, households, and businesses differently and unevenly. In the near-term if not longer, however, our credit, operational and other risks are generally expected to increase.\n\u25cf The effects on economies and markets. Whether the actions of governmental and nongovernmental authorities will be successful in mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19 is unclear. National, regional and local economies and markets could suffer disruptions that are lasting. In addition, governmental actions are meaningfully influencing the interest-rate environment, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, if the COVID-19 pandemic has an adverse effect on (1) customer deposits, (2) the ability of our borrowers to satisfy their obligations to us, (3) the demand for our loans or our other products and services, (4) other aspects of our business operations, or (5) on financial markets, real estate markets, or economic growth, this could, depending on the extent of the decline in customer deposits or loan defaults, materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company is unable to fully estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations at this time. The global pandemic may cause us to experience higher credit losses in our lending portfolio, impairment of our goodwill and other financial assets, further reduced demand for our products and services and other negative impacts on our financial position, results of operations and prospects. Sustained adverse effects may also prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements or result in downgrades in our credit ratings.\nAny of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those described above, alone or in combination with others, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Any of these negative impacts, alone or in combination with others, could exacerbate many of the risk factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.\nThe Company\u2019s active participation in PPP, or in other relief programs, may expose us to credit losses as well as litigation and compliance risk.\nTo support our customers, businesses, and communities, the Company\u2019s participation in the PPP, and participation in any other relief programs now or in the future, including those under the CARES Act, exposes us to certain credit, compliance, and other risks.\nPursuant to regulatory requirements, PPP loans are subject to forbearance of loan repayment, and if PPP borrowers fail to qualify for loan forgiveness from the SBA, the Company bears the risk of holding these loans at unfavorable interest rates. In addition, because of the short time period between the passing of the CARES Act and the implementation of the PPP, there is ambiguity in the laws, rules, and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP, which exposes us to risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP. There is risk that the SBA or another governmental entity could conclude there is a deficiency in the manner in which the Company originated, funded, or serviced PPP loans, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the CARES Act or the rules and guidance promulgated by the SBA and the U.S. Department of the Treasury regarding the operation of the PPP. In the event of such deficiency, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already made payment under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from us.\nSince the commencement of the PPP, several other banks have been subject to litigation regarding the processes and procedures that such banks followed in accepting and processing applications for the PPP. We may be exposed to the risk of similar litigation, from both customers and non-customers, with respect to the processes and procedures we used in processing applications for the PPP. If any such litigation is filed against us and is not resolved in a manner favorable to us, it may result in significant financial liability to us or adversely affect our reputation business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny regarding the Company\u2019s processing of PPP applications or its origination or servicing of PPP loans. While the SBA has stated that banks may rely on the certifications of borrowers regarding their eligibility for PPP loans, the Company also has obligations under the PPP. If the SBA found that the Company did not meet those obligations, the remedies the SBA may seek against the Company are unknown but may include not guarantying the PPP loans, resulting in credit exposure to borrowers who may be unable to repay their loans.\nDeterioration in local economic conditions may negatively impact our financial performance.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in central and upstate New York, northeastern Pennsylvania, southern New Hampshire, western Massachusetts, Vermont, southern coastal Maine, central Connecticut and the specific local markets in which the Company operates. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, the Company provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in the upstate New York areas of Norwich, Syracuse, Oneonta, Amsterdam-Gloversville, Albany, Binghamton, Utica-Rome, Plattsburgh, Glens Falls and Ogdensburg-Massena, the northeastern Pennsylvania areas of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, Berkshire County, Massachusetts, southern New Hampshire, Vermont, the southern coastal Maine area and central Connecticut. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for the Company\u2019s products and services as well as the ability of the Company\u2019s customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of the Company\u2019s deposit funding sources.\nAs a lender with the majority of our loans secured by real estate or made to businesses in New York, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine and Connecticut, a downturn in these local economies could cause significant increases in nonperforming loans, which could negatively impact our earnings. Declines in real estate values in our market areas could cause any of our loans to become inadequately collateralized, which would expose us to greater risk of loss. Additionally, a decline in real estate values could result in the decline of originations of such loans, as most of our loans and the collateral securing our loans, are located in those areas.\nVariations in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s earnings and financial condition, like that of most financial institutions, are largely dependent upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned from loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The narrowing of interest rate spreads could adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings and financial condition. The Company cannot predict with certainty, or control, changes in interest rates. Regional and local economic conditions and the policies of regulatory authorities, including monetary policies of the FRB, affect rates and, therefore, interest income and interest expense. High interest rates could also affect the amount of loans that the Company can originate because higher rates could cause customers to apply for fewer mortgages or cause depositors to shift funds from accounts that have a comparatively lower cost to accounts with a higher cost. The Company may also experience customer attrition due to competitor pricing. If the cost of interest-bearing deposits increases at a rate greater than the yields on interest-earning assets increase, net interest income will be negatively affected. Changes in the asset and liability mix may also affect net interest income. Similarly, lower interest rates cause higher yielding assets to prepay and floating or adjustable rate assets to reset to lower rates. If the Company is not able to reduce its funding costs sufficiently, due to either competitive factors or the maturity schedule of existing liabilities, then the Company\u2019s net interest margin will decline.\nAny substantial or unexpected change in, or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. See the section captioned \u201cNet Interest Income\u201d in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to the Company\u2019s management of interest rate risk.\nOur lending, and particularly our emphasis on commercial lending, exposes us to the risk of losses upon borrower default.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 54% of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial, agricultural, commercial construction and commercial real estate loans. These types of loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than residential real estate loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property, the income stream of the borrowers and, for construction loans, the accuracy of the estimate of the property\u2019s value at completion of construction and the estimated cost of construction. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate loans. Because the Company\u2019s loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and industrial, agricultural, construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans. An increase in nonperforming loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses and/or an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. See the section captioned \u201cLoans\u201d in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to our commercial and industrial, agricultural, construction and commercial real estate loans.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company maintains an allowance for loan losses, which is an allowance established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, that represents management\u2019s best estimate of expected credit losses within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the Company to make significant estimates of current credit risks, forecast economic conditions and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of the Company\u2019s control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Bank regulatory agencies periodically review the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, the Company may need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses. These potential increases in the allowance for loan losses would result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital and may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. See the section captioned \u201cRisk Management - Credit Risk\u201d in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to the Company\u2019s process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Management expects that the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for loan losses from quarter to quarter as changes in the level of allowance for loan losses will be dependent upon, among other things, macroeconomic forecasts and conditions, loan portfolio volumes and credit quality.\nStrong competition within our industry and market area could adversely affect our performance and slow our growth.\nThe Company faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources. Such competitors primarily include national, regional and community banks within the various markets in which the Company operates. Additionally, various banks continue to enter or have announced plans to enter the market areas in which the Company currently operates. The Company also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could continue to become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than the Company can.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u25cf the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets;\n\u25cf the ability to expand the Company\u2019s market position;\n\u25cf the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\n\u25cf the rate at which the Company introduces new products, services and technologies relative to its competitors;\n\u25cf customer satisfaction with the Company\u2019s level of service;\n\u25cf industry and general economic trends; and\n\u25cf the ability to attract and retain talented employees.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken the Company\u2019s competitive position, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to liquidity risk, which could adversely affect net interest income and earnings.\nThe purpose of the Company\u2019s liquidity management is to meet the cash flow obligations of its customers for both deposits and loans. The primary liquidity measurement the Company utilizes is called basic surplus, which captures the adequacy of the Company\u2019s access to reliable sources of cash relative to the stability of its funding mix of average liabilities. This approach recognizes the importance of balancing levels of cash flow liquidity from short and long-term securities with the availability of dependable borrowing sources, which can be accessed when necessary. However, competitive pressure on deposit pricing could result in a decrease in the Company\u2019s deposit base or an increase in funding costs. In addition, liquidity will come under additional pressure if loan growth exceeds deposit growth. These scenarios could lead to a decrease in the Company\u2019s basic surplus measure to an amount below the minimum policy level of 5%. To manage this risk, the Company has the ability to purchase brokered time deposits, borrow against established borrowing facilities with other banks (Federal funds) and enter into repurchase agreements with investment companies. Depending on the level of interest rates applicable to these alternatives, the Company\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. See the section captioned \u201cLiquidity Risk\u201d in Item 7.\nOur ability to service our debt, pay dividends and otherwise pay our obligations as they come due is substantially dependent on capital distributions from our subsidiaries.\nThe Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiaries. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock and interest and principal on the Company\u2019s debt. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Company. In addition, the Company\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock. The inability to receive dividends from the Bank could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA reduction in the Company\u2019s credit rating could adversely affect our business and/or the holders of our securities.\nThe credit rating agency rating our indebtedness regularly evaluates the Company and the Bank. Credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and ability to generate earnings, as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally and the economy and changes in rating methodologies. There can be no assurance that the Company will maintain our current credit ratings. A downgrade of the credit ratings of the Company or the Bank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital, significantly increase our cost of funds, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Company or purchase our securities. This could affect our growth, profitability, and financial condition, including liquidity.\nThe Company relies on third parties to provide key components of its business infrastructure.\nThe Company relies on third parties to provide key components for its business operations, such as data processing and storage, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections and network access. While the Company selects these third-party vendors carefully, it does not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services by a vendor, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt the Company\u2019s operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor\u2019s ability to serve the Company. Replacing these third party vendors also could create significant delays and expense that adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and performance.\nThe possibility of the economy\u2019s return to recessionary conditions and the possibility of further turmoil or volatility in the financial markets would likely have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nThe economy in the United States and globally has experienced volatility in recent years and may continue to do so for the foreseeable future, particularly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. There can be no assurance that economic conditions will not worsen. Unfavorable or uncertain economic conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence, limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital, increases in inflation or interest rates, the timing and impact of changing governmental policies, natural disasters (including pandemics), terrorist attacks, acts of war or a combination of these or other factors. A worsening of business and economic conditions recovery could have adverse effects on our business, including the following:\n\u25cf investors may have less confidence in the equity markets in general and in financial services industry stocks in particular, which could place downward pressure on the Company\u2019s stock price and resulting market valuation;\n\u25cf consumer and business confidence levels could be lowered and cause declines in credit usage and adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates;\n\u25cf the Company\u2019s ability to assess the creditworthiness of its customers may be impaired if the models and approaches the Company uses to select, manage and underwrite its customers become less predictive of future behaviors;\n\u25cf the Company could suffer decreases in demand for loans or other financial products and services or decreased deposits or other investments in accounts with the Company;\n\u25cf demand for and income received from the Company\u2019s fee-based services could decline;\n\u25cf customers of the Company\u2019s trust and benefit plan administration business may liquidate investments, which together with lower asset values, may reduce the level of assets under management and administration and thereby decrease the Company\u2019s investment management and administration revenues;\n\u25cf competition in the financial services industry could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions or otherwise; and;\n\u25cf the value of loans and other assets or collateral securing loans may decrease.\nWe are subject to other-than-temporary impairment risk, which could negatively impact our financial performance.\nThe process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles is highly subjective and requires significant judgment. The Company estimates the expected future cash flows of its various businesses and determines the carrying value of these businesses. The Company exercises judgment in assigning and allocating certain assets and liabilities to these businesses. The Company then compares the carrying value, including goodwill and other intangibles, to the discounted future cash flows. If the total of future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Estimates of the future cash flows associated with the assets are critical to these assessments. Changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges and therefore have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and performance.\nThere are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with the introduction or expansion of lines of business or new products and services within existing lines of business.\nFrom time to time, the Company may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, the Company may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove attainable. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Legal, Governmental and Regulatory Changes\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision, which may interfere with our ability to conduct our business and may negatively impact our financial results.\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, the DIF and the safety and soundness of the banking system as a whole, not stockholders. These regulations affect the Company\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject the Company to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer and/or limit the pricing the Company may charge on certain banking services, among other things. Compliance personnel and resources may increase our costs of operations and adversely impact our earnings.\nFailure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur. See the section captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in Item 1. Business of this report for further information.\nWe are subject to heightened regulatory requirements because we now exceed $10 billion in total consolidated assets.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had total assets of approximately $10.9 billion. The Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations impose enhanced supervisory requirements on bank holding companies with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. For bank holding companies with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, such requirements include, among other things:\n\u25cf applicability of Volcker Rule requirements and restrictions;\n\u25cf increased capital, leverage, liquidity and risk management standards;\n\u25cf examinations by the CFPB for compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations; and\n\u25cf limits on interchange fees on debit cards.\nThe EGRRCPA, which was enacted in 2018, amended Dodd-Frank Act to raise the $10 billion stress testing threshold to $250 billion, among other things. The federal financial regulators issued final rules in 2019 to increase the threshold for these stress testing requirements from $10 billion to $250 billion, consistent with the EGRRCPA.\nIn December 2020 the OCC together with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the FDIC, issued an interim final rule to temporarily mitigate transition costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic on community banking organizations with less than $10 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2019. The rule allows organizations, including the Company, to use assets as of December 31, 2019 to determine the applicability of various regulatory asset thresholds. During 2020, the Company crossed the $10 billion threshold and has elected to delay the regulatory implications of crossing the $10 billion threshold until 2022 for the limits on interchange fees on debit cards.\nWe expect that our regulators will consider our compliance with these regulatory requirements that now apply to us (in addition to regulatory requirements that applied to us previously) when examining our operations or considering any request for regulatory approval. We may, therefore, incur associated compliance costs and may be required to maintain compliance procedures.\nFailure to comply with these new requirements may negatively impact the results of our operations and financial condition. To ensure compliance, we will be required to investment significant resources, which may necessitate hiring additional personnel and implementing additional internal controls. These additional compliance costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nReplacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), announced that the FCA intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR.\nWe have a significant number of loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR, or any changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR, could have an adverse impact on the market for or value of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us, could create considerable costs and additional risk and could have an adverse impact on our overall financial condition or results of operations. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition will change our market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation.\nChanges in accounting policies, standards, and interpretations could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as revenues and expenses during the period.\nA variety of factors could affect the ultimate values of assets, liabilities, income and expenses recognized and reported in the Company\u2019s financial statements, and these ultimate values may differ materially from those determined based on management\u2019s estimates and assumptions. In addition, the FASB, regulatory agencies, and other bodies that establish accounting standards from time to time change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements. Further, those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and banking regulators) may change prior interpretations or positions regarding how these standards should be applied. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be held responsible for environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we obtain title, resulting in significant financial loss.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 was secured by real estate. In the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a government entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation and remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. These costs and claims could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions including the FHLB of New York.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated if the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company owns common stock of FHLB of New York in order to qualify for membership in the FHLB system, which enables it to borrow funds under the FHLB of New York\u2019s advance program. The carrying value and fair market value of our FHLB of New York common stock was $9.4 million as of December 31, 2020. There are 11 branches of the FHLB, including New York, which are jointly liable for the consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. To the extent that one FHLB branch cannot meet its obligations to pay its share of the system\u2019s debt, other FHLB branches can be called upon to make the payment. Any adverse effects on the FHLB of New York could adversely affect the value of our investment in its common stock and negatively impact our results of operations.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law and certain banking laws, could delay or prevent a takeover of us by a third party.\nProvisions of the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the corporate law of the State of Delaware and state and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could delay, defer or prevent a third party from acquiring the Company, despite the possible benefit to the Company\u2019s stockholders, or otherwise adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. These provisions include supermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations and advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Company\u2019s board of directors and for proposing matters that stockholders may act on at stockholder meetings. In addition, the Company is subject to Delaware law, which among other things prohibits the Company from engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met. These provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for the Company\u2019s common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of and the voting and other rights of the holders of the Company\u2019s common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors other than candidates nominated by the Board.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Privacy\nThe Company faces operational risks and cybersecurity risks associated with incidents which have the potential to disrupt our operations, cause material harm to our financial condition, result in misappropriation of assets, compromise confidential information and/or damage our business relationships and cannot guarantee that the steps we and our service providers take in response to these risks will be effective.\nWe depend upon data processing, communication systems, and information exchange on a variety of platforms and networks and over the internet to conduct business operations. In addition, we rely on the services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs. Although we require third party providers to maintain certain levels of security, such providers remain vulnerable to breaches, security incidents, system unavailability or other malicious attacks that could compromise sensitive information. The risk of experiencing security incidents and disruptions, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions by organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties has increased. These security incidents may result in disruption of our operations; material harm to our financial condition, cash flows and the market price of our common stock; misappropriation of assets; compromise or corruption of confidential information; liability for information or assets stolen during the incident; remediation costs; increased cybersecurity and insurance costs; regulatory enforcement; litigation; and damage to our stakeholder and customer relationships.\nMoreover, in the normal course of business, we and our service providers collect and retain certain personal information provided by our customers, employees and vendors. If this information gets mishandled, misused, improperly accessed, lost or stolen, we could suffer significant financial, business, reputations, regulatory or other harm. These risks may increase as we continue to increase and expand our usage of web-based products and applications.\nThese risks require continuous and likely increasing attention and resources from us to, among other actions, identify and quantify potential cybersecurity risks, upgrade and expand our technologies, systems and processes to adequately address the risk. We provide on-going training for our employees to assist them in detecting phishing, malware and other malicious schemes. Such attention diverts time and resources from other activities and, while we have implemented policies and procedures designed to maintain the security and integrity of the information we and our service providers collect on our and their computer systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be effective. Likewise, while we have implemented security measures to prevent unauthorized access to personal information and prevent or limit the effect of possible incidents, we can provide no assurance that a security breach or disruption will not be successful or damaging, or, if any such breach or disruption does occur, that it can be sufficiently or timely remediated.\nEven the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by fraud.\nAs a financial institution, the Company is inherently exposed to operational risk in the form of theft and other fraudulent activity by employees, customers and other third parties targeting the Company and/or the Company\u2019s customers or data. Such activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Although the Company devotes substantial resources to maintaining effective policies and internal controls to identify and prevent such incidents, given the increasing sophistication of possible perpetrators, the Company may experience financial losses or reputational harm as a result of fraud.\nWe continually encounter technological change and the failure to understand and adapt to these changes could have a material adverse impact our business.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to serve customers better and to reduce costs. The Company\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Company\u2019s operations. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological changes affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and, in turn, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to an Investment in the Company\u2019s Securities\nThe Company\u2019s common stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock price constantly changes. The market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf the political climate and whether the proposed policies of the current Presidential administration in the U.S. that have affected market prices for financial institution stocks are successfully implemented;\n\u25cf changes in securities analysts\u2019 recommendations or expectations of financial performance;\n\u25cf volatility of stock market prices and volumes;\n\u25cf incorrect information or speculation;\n\u25cf changes in industry valuations;\n\u25cf variations in operating results from general expectations;\n\u25cf actions taken against the Company by various regulatory agencies;\n\u25cf changes in authoritative accounting guidance;\n\u25cf changes in general domestic economic conditions such as inflation rates, tax rates, unemployment rates, labor and healthcare cost trend rates, recessions and changing government policies, laws and regulations; and\n\u25cf severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events.\nThere may be future sales or other dilution of the Company\u2019s equity, which may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s stock.\nThe Company is not restricted from issuing additional common stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. The Company also grants shares of common stock to employees and directors under the Company\u2019s incentive plan each year. The issuance of any additional shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or preferred stock or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or that represent the right to receive common stock or the exercise of such securities could be substantially dilutive to stockholders of the Company\u2019s common stock. Holders of the Company\u2019s common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle such holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares or any class or series. Because the Company\u2019s decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions, its acquisition activity and other factors, the Company cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of its future offerings. Thus, the Company\u2019s stockholders bear the risk of the Company\u2019s future offerings reducing the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock and diluting their stock holdings in the Company.\nGeneral Risks\nThe risks presented by acquisitions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe business strategy of the Company has included and may continue to include growth through acquisition. Any future acquisitions will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions. These risks may include, among other things:\n\u25cf exposure to potential asset quality issues of the acquired business;\n\u25cf potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired business;\n\u25cf our ability to realize anticipated cost savings;\n\u25cf the difficulty of integrating operations and personnel and the potential loss of key employees;\n\u25cf the potential disruption of our or the acquired company\u2019s ongoing business in such a way that could result in decreased revenues or the inability of our management to maximize our financial and strategic position;\n\u25cf the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; and\n\u25cf the impairment of relationships with the acquired company\u2019s employees and customers as a result of changes in ownership and management.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on the achievement of our business strategy and results of operations.\nWe rely on our management and other key personnel, and the loss of any of them may adversely affect our operations.\nWe are and will continue to be dependent upon the services of our executive management team. In addition, we will continue to depend on our ability to retain and recruit key client relationship managers. The unexpected loss of services of any key management personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 77415, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "NBTB"}
