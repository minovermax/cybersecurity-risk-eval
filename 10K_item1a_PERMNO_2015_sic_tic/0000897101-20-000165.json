RISK FACTORS\nForward Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements within the meaning of and in reliance on the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which provides a \u201csafe harbor\u201d for forward-looking statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the risk factors discussed below.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe primary markets we serve are highly competitive, and our ability to compete requires continual focus on delivering high-quality, competitively priced products and services and the regular introduction of new products and services that meet evolving customer requirements.\nCompetition in the markets for enterprise networks and voice and data communications products is intense. Our ability to compete with other manufacturers and marketers of these products depends primarily on our engineering, OEM/ODM relationships, manufacturing, and marketing skills; the price, quality and reliability of our products; our delivery and service capabilities; and our control of operating expenses. Our JDL subsidiary experiences intense competition from other providers of IT products and services. We have experienced, and anticipate continuing to experience, pricing pressures from our customers as well as our competitors. The markets we serve are characterized by rapid technological advances and evolving industry standards. These markets can be significantly affected by new product introductions and marketing activities of industry participants. Some of our current competitors and potential competitors have greater financial, technological, manufacturing, marketing, and personnel resources than we possess. These current and future competitors may be able to identify new markets and develop new products that are superior to those we develop. They may also adapt new technologies faster, devote greater resources to research and development, promote products more aggressively, and price products more competitively. We cannot ensure that competition will not intensify or that we will be able to compete effectively in the markets in which we compete.\nOur gross margins have fluctuated year to year, and we face many challenges in maintaining acceptable margins.\nGross margins among our products and services vary and are subject to fluctuation from quarter to quarter and year to year. The factors that may affect our gross margins adversely are numerous and include:\n\u25cf\nChanges in customer, geographic, or product mix;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to reduce product costs\n\u25cf\nRoyalties related to technology licensing\n\u25cf\nIncreases in material or labor costs\n\u25cf\nExpediting costs incurred to meet customer delivery requirements\n\u25cf\nExcess inventory and inventory carrying charges\n\u25cf\nTariffs on imported products\n\u25cf\nObsolescence charges\n\u25cf\nChanges in shipment volume\n\u25cf\nChanges in component pricing\n\u25cf\nChanges in OEM/ODM pricing\n\u25cf\nIncreased price competition\n\u25cf\nChanges in distribution channels\n\u25cf\nLower margins on competitive-bid contracts\n\u25cf\nIncreased warranty cost and\n\u25cf\nOur ability to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nConsolidation among our customers has occurred and further consolidation may occur, resulting in the loss of some customers and reducing revenue during the pendency of business combinations and related integration activities.\nWe believe future consolidation may occur among our customers as they attempt to increase market share and achieve greater economies of scale. Consolidation has affected our business as our customers focus on completing business combinations and integrating their operations. In some instances, customers integrating large-scale acquisitions have reduced their purchases of our products as they integrate.\nThe business effect on us of significant customer mergers is likely to be unclear until sometime after these transactions are completed. After a consolidation occurs, a customer may choose to reduce the number of vendors from which it purchases equipment and services and may choose one of our competitors as its preferred vendor. We cannot ensure that we will continue to supply equipment to the surviving communications service provider after a business combination is completed.\nWe cannot guarantee the ability of the Special Committee of our Board of Directors to develop strategic options for the Company and the Company\u2019s ability to implement these strategies.\nIn May of 2018 the Company announced it had appointed a special committee of the board to perform a strategic review of the Company\u2019s businesses to explore opportunities for enhancing shareholder value and had engaged an investment banking firm to advise it in this process. The disposition of the Suttle operations were a result of this initiative. Failure to develop a growth strategy, failure to maintain positive operating income or investing in technology ventures that do not enhance value or that we cannot incorporate into our products, could result in operating losses and lack of shareholder confidence, which could negatively impact cash flow and the trading price of our common stock.\nOur information technology systems may be exposed to various cybersecurity risks and other disruptions that could impair our ability to operate, adversely affect our business, and damage our brand and reputation. Risks are particularly acute in the cloud-based technologies that we and other third parties operate and that form a part of our solutions.\nWe rely extensively on our information technology systems or on third parties for services including our enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system, banking, payroll, shipping, and e-mail systems to conduct business. We also collect, store and transmit sensitive data, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers, suppliers and employees.\nDespite our investment in our information technology systems and data security program, the implementation of security measures to protect our data and infrastructure against breaches and other cyber threats, and our use of internal processes and controls designed to protect the security and availability of our systems, our information technology and communication systems may be vulnerable to cybersecurity risks such as computer viruses, hacking, malware, denial of service attacks, cyber terrorism, circumvention of security systems, malfeasance, breaches due to employee error, natural disasters, telecommunications failure, at our facilities or at third-party locations.\nThe General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, took effect on May 25, 2018, in the European Union and introduced direct compliance obligations for data controllers and data processors. National Data Protection Agencies, or NDPAs, are now able to impose fines for violations ranging from 2% to 4% of annual worldwide turnover, or 10 million to 20 million euro, whichever is greater. NDPAs have the power to carry out audits, request information, and obtain access to premises. Businesses must be able to demonstrate that the personal data of any data subject can be lawfully processed on one of the six specified grounds. The GDPR adopts a risk-based approach to compliance, under which businesses bear responsibility for assessing the degree of risk that their processing activities pose to data subjects. Businesses are required to perform data protection impact assessments before any processing that uses new technology and is likely to result in a high risk to data subjects. The GDPR requires businesses to maintain records of their processing activities. The GDPR establishes clear rules around data breach notifications and the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific individual have been set out by the GDPR. In addition, under the GDPR, data subjects have new rights, for example, the right to request that businesses delete their personal data (the right to be forgotten); to object to their personal data being processed; and to obtain a copy of their personal data within a set time frame.\nSimilar to the GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective January 1, 2020, grants California residents with several new rights relating to their personal information. The CCPA applies to businesses that conduct business in California and satisfies one of three financial conditions, including a business that has a gross revenue greater than $25 million. The CCPA sets forth several data protection obligations for applicable businesses, including the obligation to inform a consumer, at or before collection, of the purpose and intended use of the collection, and the obligation to delete a consumer\u2019s personal information upon request. The CCPA establishes a private right of action that allows consumers the right to seek damages for serious data breaches. The CCPA also allows the California Attorney General to bring actions against non-compliant businesses with fines of $2,500 per violation or, if intentional, up to $7,500 per violation. Any failure by us to comply with the GDPR or the CCPA could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nComplying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any regulatory requirements or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity and adversely affect us. In addition, as noted above, we are subject to the possibility of security breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these laws.\nAny failure, breach or unauthorized access to our or third-party systems could result in the loss of confidential, sensitive or proprietary information, interruptions in our service or production or otherwise our ability to conduct business operations, and could result in potential reductions in revenue and profits, damage to our reputation or liability. There can be no assurance that our protective measures will prevent or timely detect security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, our JDL Technologies subsidiary provides IT services for the Company internally and for third party customers. As we continue to direct a portion of our JDL sales efforts toward Cloud solutions, we expect to store, convey and potentially process increasing amounts of data produced by customer devices. This data may include confidential or proprietary information, intellectual property or personally identifiable information of our customers or other third parties with whom they do business. It is important that we maintain solutions and related infrastructure that are perceived by our customers and other parties with whom we do business as providing a reasonable level of reliability and security. Despite any available security measures and other precautions that we deploy, the infrastructure and transmission methods we use directly or through third parties, may be vulnerable to interception, attack or other disruptive problems. Continued high-profile data breaches at other companies evidence an external environment that is becoming increasingly hostile to information security. Improper disclosure of data or perception that our data security is insufficient could harm our reputation, give rise to legal proceedings, and subject our company to liability under laws that protect data, any of which could result in increased costs and loss of revenue.\nIf a cyberattack or other security incident were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of our customers\u2019 data or our own data, whether due to a failure with our systems or related systems operated by third parties, we could suffer damage to our brand and reputation. The costs we would incur to address and fix these incidents would increase our expenses. These types of security incidents could also lead to lawsuits, regulatory investigations and increased legal liability, including in some cases contractual costs related to customer notification and fraud monitoring. Further, as regulatory focus on privacy and data security issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the protection of information become more complex, the potential risks and costs of compliance to our business will intensify.\nOur financial results could be adversely affected if one or more of our key customers substantially reduces orders for our products.\nTraditionally, we have derived a large portion of our revenues from a relatively small number of customers, with our top ten customers accounting for 74%, and 75% of net sales for 2019 and 2018, respectively. In fiscal 2019, two Transition Networks\u2019 customers accounted for 21% and 16% of consolidated sales. In fiscal 2018, two Transition Networks\u2019 customer accounted for 18% and 15% of consolidated sales. The loss of or a substantial reduction in purchases by any one or more of our top customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nOur market is subject to rapid technological change and, to compete effectively, we must continually introduce new products that achieve market acceptance.\nThe enterprise network and communications equipment industry is characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, changing market conditions, short product life cycles, rapidly changing customer requirements, and frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements. The introduction of products using new technologies or the adoption of new industry standards can make our existing products, or products under development, obsolete or unmarketable. Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products, to introduce new products to meet changing customer requirements and emerging technologies, and to demonstrate the performance advantages and cost-effectiveness of our products over competing products. Our failure to modify our products to support alternative technologies or failure to achieve widespread customer acceptance of these modified products could cause us to lose market share and cause our revenues to decline.\nWe may not predict technological trends or the success of new products in the enterprise network and communications equipment markets accurately. New product development often requires forecasting of market trends, development and implementation of new technologies and processes and capital commitments. We do not know whether other new products we develop will gain market acceptance or result in profitable sales.\nSome competitors have greater engineering and product development resources. Although we expect to continue to invest significant resources in product development activities, our efforts to achieve and maintain profitability will require us to be selective and focused with our research and development expenditures. If we fail to anticipate or respond in a cost-effective and timely manner to technological developments, changes in industry standards or customer requirements, or if we experience any significant delays in product development or introduction, our business, operating results and financial condition could be affected adversely.\nWe may experience delays in developing and marketing product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change, evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements. Specifically as we attempt to develop more software products and continue to expand our existing product set, we cannot ensure that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction, and marketing of these products or product enhancements, or that our new products, including software-based products, and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve any significant or sustainable degree of market acceptance in existing or additional markets. In addition, the future introductions or announcements of products by us or one of our competitors embodying new technologies or changes in industry standards or customer requirements could render our then-existing products obsolete or unmarketable. We cannot ensure that the introduction or announcement of new product offerings by us or one or more of our competitors will not cause customers to defer their purchase of our existing products, which could cause our revenues to decline.\nOur business units are dependent upon federal government spending.\nOur JDL Technologies and Transition Networks business units are involved in projects that receive much of their funding from the United States federal government. To the extent that federal government spending is delayed or curtailed by government actions, our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe evaluate and frequently pursue acquisitions, but we may not successfully close these acquisitions and, if these acquisitions are completed, we may have difficulty integrating the acquired businesses with our existing operations.\nWe regularly consider the acquisition of complementary companies and product lines. We cannot, however, ensure that we will be able to find appropriate candidates for acquisitions, reach agreement to acquire them, or obtain any required shareholder or regulatory approvals needed to close strategic acquisitions, despite the effort and management attention invested.\nThe impact of future acquisitions on our business, operating results and financial condition is uncertain. In the case of businesses we may acquire in the future, we may have difficulty assimilating these businesses and their products, services, technologies and personnel into our operations. These difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and workforce, increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Also, we may not be able to retain key management and other critical employees after an acquisition. We may also acquire unanticipated liabilities. In addition to these risks, we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions.\nOur operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nOur operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may be caused by many factors, including the following:\n\u25cf\nthe volume and timing of customer orders and our ability to fulfill those orders in a timely manner\n\u25cf\nthe overall level of capital expenditures by our customers\n\u25cf\nfactors such as the coronavirus (COVID-19), which may affect our supply stream, our employee work force, our customers, or the general United States and world economy\n\u25cf\nwork stoppages and other developments affecting the operations of our customers\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain new customers and customer contracts\n\u25cf\nthe timing of our revenue recognition\n\u25cf\nthe timing of our new product and service introductions\n\u25cf\nthe availability of products and services we need from our suppliers\n\u25cf\nmarket acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products and services\n\u25cf\nvariations in the mix of products and services we sell\n\u25cf\nthe timing of federal and state government funding of projects\n\u25cf\nthe location and utilization of our production capacity and employees and\n\u25cf\nthe availability and cost of key components of our products.\nOur expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenues. If revenue levels in a particular quarter are lower than expected, our operating results will be affected adversely.\nWe depend on OEM/ODM relationships and on limited-source suppliers and any disruptions in these relationships may cause damage to our customer relationships.\nWe procure all parts and certain services involved in the production of our products from, and subcontract much of our product manufacturing to outside firms that specialize in these services. Although most of the components of our products are available from multiple vendors, we have several single-source supplier relationships, either because alternative sources are not available or because the relationship is advantageous to us. We cannot ensure that our suppliers will be able to meet our future requirements for products and components in a timely fashion. In addition, the availability of many of these components to us is dependent in part on our ability to provide our suppliers with accurate forecasts of our future requirements. Delays or lost sales could be caused by other factors beyond our control, including defects in the quality of components or products supplied by others.\nWe are dependent upon our senior management and other critical employees.\nLike all companies, our success depends on the efforts and abilities of our senior management personnel and other critical employees, including those in sales, marketing and product development functions. Our ability to attract, retain and motivate these employees is critical to our success. In addition, because we may acquire one or more businesses in the future, our success may depend, in part, upon our ability to retain and integrate our own personnel with personnel from acquired entities that are necessary to the continued success or the successful integration of the acquired businesses.\nManaging our inventory is complex and may include write-downs of excess or obsolete inventory.\nManaging our inventory of components and finished products is complicated by a number of factors, including the need to maintain a significant inventory of finished goods for orders we anticipate but do not receive. These issues may cause us to purchase and maintain significant amounts of inventory. If this inventory is not used as expected based on anticipated requirements, it may become excess or obsolete. The existence of excess or obsolete inventory can result in sales price reductions or inventory write-downs, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe face risks associated with expanding our sales outside of the United States.\nWe believe that our future growth depends in part upon our ability to increase sales in international markets. These sales are subject to a variety of risks, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, tariffs, import restrictions and other trade barriers, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, longer accounts receivable payment cycles, potentially adverse tax consequences, and export license requirements. In addition, we are subject to the risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including political and economic instability and unexpected changes in diplomatic and trade relationships. We cannot ensure that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business strategy and financial condition.\nOur failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could limit our ability to detect and prevent fraud and thereby adversely affect our business and stock price.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant continuing costs, including accounting fees and staffing costs, to maintain compliance with the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Expansion of our business, particularly internationally, would require ongoing changes to our internal control systems, processes and information systems. In addition, if we complete future acquisitions, our ability to integrate operations of the acquired company could affect our continued compliance with the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nWe maintain internal controls to generate reliable financial reports. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the consolidated financial system preparation and presentation. Our inability to maintain an effective control environment may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nProduct defects or the failure of our products to meet specifications could cause us to lose customers and revenue or to incur unexpected expenses.\nIf our products do not meet our customers\u2019 performance requirements, our customer relationships may suffer. Also, our products may contain defects or fail to meet product specifications. Any failure or poor performance of our products could result in:\n\u25cf\ndelayed market acceptance of our products\n\u25cf\ndelayed product shipments\n\u25cf\nunexpected expenses and diversion of resources to replace defective products or identify and correct the source of errors\n\u25cf\ndamage to our reputation and our customer relationships\n\u25cf\ndelayed recognition of sales or reduced sales, and\n\u25cf\nproduct liability claims or other claims for damages that may be caused by any product defects or performance failures.\nOur sales and operations may continue to be adversely affected by current global economic conditions.\nOver the past several years, financial markets globally have experienced periods of extreme disruption. These have included, among other things, extreme volatility in securities prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, ratings downgrades of some investments and declining valuations of others, tariffs on imports and exports. The frequency, severity and duration of these disruptions in the financial markets and the global economy are unknown. We cannot ensure that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and in business conditions generally. These economic developments have adversely affected our business in a number of ways and will likely continue to adversely affect our business during the foreseeable future.\nOur sales and operations may be adversely affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic.\nWhile over 96% of our Transition Networks products are TAA compliant and therefore manufactured outside of China, there are some passive components and metals that may be sourced from China. We are making supply chain adjustments to source these components elsewhere. We are monitoring the situation very closely and will be proactive to maintain our supply chain.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been volatile historically and the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as quarterly variations in operating results, announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors, the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us, and new reports relating to trends in our markets or general economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and prices for companies in our industry in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents, our shareholder rights agreement and Minnesota law could prevent or delay a change in control of our company.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and Minnesota law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable, and could limit the price that investors are willing to pay for our common stock. These provisions include the following:\n\u25cf\nadvance notice requirements for shareholder proposals\n\u25cf\nauthorization for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval\n\u25cf\nlimitations on business combinations with interested shareholders and\n\u25cf\na super majority vote by shareholders is required to approve certain corporate actions, including merger transactions.\nSome of these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of our company even though our shareholders would receive an attractive value for their shares, or a significant number of our shareholders believe such a proposed transaction would be in their best interest.\nThe payment and amount of future dividends and number of shares we repurchase in the future under our Stock Repurchase Program is subject to Board of Director discretion and to various risks and uncertainties.\nThe payment and amount of future quarterly dividends is within the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on factors the Board deems relevant at the time declaration of a dividend is considered. These factors include, but are not limited to: available cash; management\u2019s expectations regarding future performance and free cash flow; alternative uses of cash to fund R&D expenditures and capital expenditures required to fund future growth; and, the effect of various risks and uncertainties described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. In addition, we adopted a Stock Repurchase Program in 2019. Our ability to continue this program or conduct future stock repurchase programs will depend on some of these same factors.", "PERMNO": 25452, "SIC": 3661, "TIC": "JCS"}
