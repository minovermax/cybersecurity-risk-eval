{"cik": "110471", "company": "WOLVERINE WORLD WIDE INC /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business\nChanges in general economic conditions and other factors affecting consumer spending could adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales, operating results or financial position.\nThe Company\u2019s operations depend on factors affecting consumer disposable income and spending patterns. These factors include general economic conditions, employment rates, business conditions, interest rates and tax policy in each of the markets and regions in which the Company or its third-party distributors and licenses operates. Customers may defer or cancel purchases of the Company\u2019s products due to uncertainty about global economic conditions. Consumer confidence may decline due to recessionary economic cycles, high interest rates on consumer or business borrowings, restricted credit availability, inflation, high levels of unemployment or consumer debt, high tax rates or other economic factors. A decline in consumer confidence could adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products. Changes and the growth or decline of global footwear, apparel or consumer-direct markets could negatively affect consumer spending. A decline in demand for the Company\u2019s products could reduce its revenues or profit margins.\nGeneral economic conditions and other factors, such as those listed above, may increase the Company\u2019s cost of sales and decrease the Company\u2019s profitability. The Company\u2019s profitability is also dependent on the prices of commodities, such as cotton, leather, rubber, petroleum, cattle and pigskin hides, used to make and transport its products, as well as the prices of labor, insurance and health care, all of which may be affected by general economic conditions.\nThe Company operates in competitive industries and markets.\nThe Company competes with a large number of manufacturers, marketers, wholesalers, or retailers of footwear or apparel, and consumer-direct companies. Some of these competitors are larger and have greater resources than the Company. Important elements of such competition are product performance and quality, including technological improvements, product identity, competitive pricing and the ability to adapt to style changes. Consumer preferences and, as a result, the popularity of particular designs and categories of footwear and apparel, generally change over time. The Company's efforts to maintain and improve its competitive position by monitoring and responding to changes in consumer preferences, increasing brand awareness, gaining sourcing efficiencies, and enhancing the style, comfort and perceived value of its products may not be successful. The Company\u2019s continued ability to sell its products at competitive prices and to meet shifts in consumer preferences will affect its future sales. If the Company is unable to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences and spending, its results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.\nMany of the Company\u2019s competitors have larger customer and consumer bases, are able to sell their products at lower prices, or have greater financial, technical or marketing resources than the Company, particularly its competitors in the apparel and consumer-direct businesses. The Company\u2019s competitors may own more recognized brands; implement more effective marketing campaigns; adopt more aggressive pricing policies; make more attractive offers to potential employees, distribution partners and manufacturers; or respond more quickly to changes in consumer preferences. The Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected if it fails to compete successfully in the footwear, apparel and retail markets.\nThe Company\u2019s operating results could be adversely affected if it is unable to maintain its brands\u2019 positive images with consumers or adjust to changing footwear and apparel trends.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends in part on its brands\u2019 images. If the Company is unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer preferences and evolving footwear and apparel trends, the names and images of its brands may be impaired. If the Company fails to react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences, consumers may consider its brands\u2019 images to be outdated or associate its brands with styles that are no longer popular. Such failures could result in substantial unsold inventory and adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s operating results depend on effectively managing inventory levels.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to manage its inventories effectively is an important factor in its operations. Inventory shortages can impede the Company\u2019s ability to meet demand, adversely affect the timing of shipments to customers, and, consequently, diminish brand loyalty and decrease sales. Conversely, excess inventory can result in lower gross margins if the Company lowers prices in order to liquidate it. In addition, inventory may become obsolete as a result of changes in consumer preferences over time. The Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected if it is unable to effectively manage its inventory.\nIncreases or changes in duties, quotas, tariffs and other trade restrictions could adversely impact the Company\u2019s sales and profitability.\nAll of the Company\u2019s products manufactured overseas and imported into the U.S., the European Union and other countries are subject to customs duties collected by customs authorities. The customs information submitted by the Company is routinely subject to review by customs authorities. Additional U.S. or foreign customs duties, quotas, tariffs, anti-dumping duties, safeguard measures, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, the loss of most favored nation trading status or other trade restrictions may be imposed on the importation of the Company\u2019s products in the future. The imposition of such costs or restrictions in countries where the Company operates, as well as in countries where its third-party distributors and licensees operate, could result in increases in the cost of the Company\u2019s products generally and could adversely affect its sales and profitability.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business.\nForeign currency fluctuations affect the Company\u2019s revenue and profitability. Changes in currency exchange rates may impact the Company\u2019s financial results positively or negatively in one period and not another, which may make it difficult to compare its operating results from different periods. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may also adversely impact third parties that manufacture the Company\u2019s products by making their costs of raw materials or other production costs more expensive and more difficult to finance, thereby raising prices for the Company, its distributors or its licensees. The Company\u2019s hedging strategy is not designed to reduce all risks, as no hedging strategy can completely insulate the Company from foreign exchange risk. For a more detailed discussion of the risks related to foreign currency fluctuation, see Item 7A: \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\".\nSignificant capacity constraints, production disruptions, quality issues, price increases or other risks associated with foreign sourcing could increase the Company\u2019s operating costs and adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and reputation.\nThe Company currently sources a substantial majority of its products from third-party manufacturers in foreign countries, predominantly the Asia Pacific region. As is common in the industry, the Company does not have long-term contracts with its third-party suppliers. There can be no assurance that the Company will not experience difficulties with such suppliers, including reductions in the availability of production capacity, failures to meet production deadlines, failure to make products that meet applicable quality standards, or increases in manufacturing costs. The Company\u2019s future results depend partly on its ability to maintain its relationships with third-party suppliers.\nForeign manufacturing is subject to a number of risks, including work stoppages, transportation delays and interruptions, political instability, foreign currency fluctuations, changing economic conditions, expropriation, nationalization, the imposition of tariffs, import and export controls and other non-tariff barriers and changes in governmental policies. Various factors could significantly interfere with the Company\u2019s ability to source its products, including adverse developments in trade or political relations with China or other countries where it sources its products, or a shift in these countries' manufacturing capacities away from footwear and apparel to other industries. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial position and, in particular, on the Company\u2019s ability to meet customer demands and produce its products in a cost-effective manner.\nThe cost of raw materials, labor and services could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to competitively price its products depends on the cost of components, services, labor, equipment and raw materials, including leather and materials used in the production of footwear. The cost of services and materials is subject to change based on availability and market conditions that are difficult to predict. Various conditions, such as diseases affecting the availability of leather, affect the cost of the footwear marketed by the Company. Increases in costs for services and materials used in production could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position. The Company purchases raw pigskins for its leathers operations from a single domestic source pursuant to short-term contracts. If this source fails to continue to supply the Company with raw pigskin or supplies the Company with raw pigskin on less favorable terms, the Company\u2019s cost of raw materials for its leathers operations could increase and, as a result, have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nLabor disruptions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on its ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. Labor disputes at or that affect independent factories where the Company\u2019s goods are produced, shipping ports, including the current labor dispute at west coast U.S. ports, tanneries, transportation carriers, retail stores or distribution centers create significant risks for the Company\u2019s business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions. Any such disruption may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business by potentially resulting in cancelled orders by customers and unanticipated inventory accumulation, and may negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nA significant reduction in wholesale customer purchases of the Company\u2019s products or failure of customers to pay for the Company\u2019s products in a timely manner could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s financial success is directly related to its wholesale customers continuing to purchase its products. The Company does not typically have long-term contracts with its customers. Sales to the Company\u2019s customers are generally on an order-to-order basis and are subject to rights of cancellation and rescheduling by the customers. Failure to fill customers\u2019 orders in a timely manner could harm the Company\u2019s relationships with its customers. Furthermore, if any of the Company\u2019s major customers experiences a significant downturn in its business, or fails to remain committed to the Company\u2019s products or brands, these customers may reduce or discontinue purchases from the Company, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company sells its products to customers and extends credit based on an evaluation of each customer\u2019s financial condition. The financial difficulties of a customer could cause the Company to stop doing business with that customer or reduce its business with that customer. The Company\u2019s inability to collect from its customers or a cessation or reduction of sales to certain customers because of credit concerns could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial position.\nRetail consolidation could lead to fewer customers, customers seeking more favorable price, payment or other terms from the Company and a decrease in the number of stores that carry its products. In addition, changes in the channels of distribution, such as the continued growth of internet commerce and related competitive pressures, and the sale of private label products by major retailers, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company has been awarded a number of U.S. Department of Defense contracts that include future purchase options for Bates\u00ae footwear. The U.S. Department of Defense is not obligated to exercise these future purchase options for Bates\u00ae footwear or to solicit future footwear awards at levels consistent with historical awards or in a manner in which the Company, as a large business contractor under Small Business Administration rules, is eligible to bid. Failure by the U.S. Department of Defense to exercise purchase options or the Company\u2019s failure to secure future U.S. Department of Defense contracts could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company\u2019s consumer-direct operations have required, and will continue to require, a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company\u2019s consumer-direct locations have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company has also made substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with the Company\u2019s brick and mortar consumer-direct operations, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and employee-related costs. Many factors, some of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, pose risks and uncertainties to the Company\u2019s consumer-direct operations. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in consumer spending patterns and retail shopping preferences, including the shift from brick and mortar to eCommerce and mobile channels and the Company's ability to increase sales in eCommerce and mobility channels. The Company\u2019s failure to successfully respond to these factors could adversely affect the Company\u2019s consumer-direct business, as well as damage its reputation and brands, and could materially affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nWeather conditions affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company markets and sells footwear and apparel suited for specific seasons, such as sandals and flats for the summer season and boots for the winter season. If the weather conditions for a particular season vary significantly from those typical for the season, such as an unusually cold and rainy summer, or an unusually warm and dry winter, consumer demand for seasonally appropriate products could be adversely affected. Lower demand for seasonally appropriate merchandise may result in excess inventory, forcing the Company to sell these products at significantly discounted prices, which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. Conversely, if weather conditions permit the Company to sell seasonal products early in the season, this may reduce inventory levels needed to meet customers\u2019 needs later in that same season. Consequently, the Company\u2019s results of operations are highly dependent on future weather conditions and its ability to react to changes in weather conditions. Weather conditions can also impact the Company's ability to distribute its products on a timely basis.\nChanges in the credit markets could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nChanges in the credit markets could adversely impact the Company\u2019s future results of operations and financial position. If the Company\u2019s third-party distributors, suppliers and retailers are not able to obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all, they may delay or cancel orders for the Company\u2019s products, or fail to meet their obligations to the Company in a timely manner, either of which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s sales, cash flow and operating results.\nUnfavorable findings resulting from a government audit could subject the Company to a variety of penalties and sanctions, and could negatively impact its future revenues.\nThe U.S. federal government has the right to audit the Company\u2019s performance under its government contracts. If a government audit discovers improper or illegal activities, the Company could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with U.S. federal government agencies. The Company could also suffer serious harm to its reputation if the U.S. government alleges that the Company acted in an improper or illegal manner, whether or not any such allegations have merit. If, as the result of an audit or for any other reason, the Company is suspended or barred from contracting with the U.S. federal government generally, or any specific agency thereof, if the Company\u2019s reputation or relationship with government agencies is impaired, or if the U.S. federal government otherwise ceases doing business with the Company or significantly decreases the amount of business it does with the Company, the Company\u2019s revenue and profitability would decrease. The Company is also subject to customs and other audits in various jurisdictions where it operates. Negative audit findings in foreign jurisdictions similarly could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nAn increase in the Company\u2019s effective tax rate or negative determinations by domestic or foreign tax authorities could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nA significant amount of the Company\u2019s earnings are generated by its Canadian, European and Asia Pacific subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, in jurisdictions that are not subject to income tax. As a result, the Company\u2019s income tax expense has historically differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due to discrete items and because the Company does not provide for U.S. taxes on earnings it considers to be permanently reinvested in foreign operations. The Company\u2019s future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions in which the Company generates income; changes in, or in the interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company does business; decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates; or if the Company repatriates foreign earnings (or if U.S. tax laws change to tax foreign earnings) for which no provision for U.S. taxes has previously been made. An increase in the Company\u2019s effective tax rate could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial position.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, and establishes reserves for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. There can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nFailure of the Company\u2019s third-party licensees and distributors to meet sales goals or to make timely payments on amounts owed to the Company could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nIn many international markets, independent third-party licensees or distributors sell the Company\u2019s products. Failure by the Company\u2019s licensees or distributors to meet planned annual sales goals or to make timely payments on amounts owed to the Company could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial position. If a change in licensee or distributor becomes necessary, it may be difficult and costly to locate an acceptable substitute distributor or licensee and the Company may experience increased costs, as well as substantial disruption and a resulting loss of sales and brand equity in the market where such licensee or distributor operates.\nThe Company\u2019s reputation and competitive position are dependent on its third-party manufacturers, distributors, licensees and others complying with applicable laws and ethical standards.\nThe Company requires its independent contract manufacturers, third-party distributors, third-party licensees and others with which it does business to comply with all applicable laws and ethical standards relating to working conditions and other matters. If a party with which the Company does business is found to have violated applicable laws or ethical standards, the Company could receive negative publicity that could damage its reputation, negatively affect the value of its brands and subject the Company to legal risks.\nIn addition, the Company relies on its third-party licensees to help preserve the value of the Company\u2019s brands. The Company's attempts to protect its brands through approval rights over design, production processes, quality, packaging, merchandising,\ndistribution, advertising and promotion of its licensed products may not be successful, as the Company cannot completely control the use by its licensees of its licensed brands. The misuse of a brand by a licensee could adversely affect the value of such brand.\nGlobal political and economic uncertainty could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company's products are marketed in approximately 200 countries and territories, and the Company sources a substantial majority of its products offshore. Concerns regarding acts of terrorism or regional and international conflicts have created significant global economic and political uncertainties that may have material and adverse effects on consumer demand, acceptance of U.S. brands in international markets, foreign sourcing of products, shipping and transportation, product imports and exports, and the sale of products in foreign markets, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to source, manufacture, distribute and sell its products. The Company is subject to risks related to doing business in developing countries and economically volatile areas. These risks include social, political and economic instability, nationalization by local governmental authorities of the Company\u2019s, its distributors\u2019, or its licensees\u2019 assets and operations; slower payment of invoices; and restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to repatriate foreign currency or receive payment of amounts owed by third-party distributors and licensees. In addition, commercial laws in these areas may not be well developed or consistently administered, and new unfavorable laws may be retroactively applied. Any of these risks could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s prospects and results of operations in these areas.\nConcerns regarding euro instability could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financing.\nConcerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain countries in the Eurozone, including Greece, and their ability to meet future financial obligations, as well as the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Eurozone countries. These concerns could lead to the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more Eurozone countries, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro as a currency. Should the euro be dissolved, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at that time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s euro-denominated assets and obligations. In addition, concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in Europe and elsewhere could have an adverse impact on the capital markets generally and, more specifically, on the ability of the Company\u2019s customers, suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses.\nIf the Company is unsuccessful in establishing and protecting its intellectual property, the value of its brands could be adversely affected.\nThe Company invests significant resources to develop and protect its intellectual property, and it believes that its trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its future success. The Company\u2019s ability to remain competitive is dependent upon its continued ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property rights in the U.S. and internationally for all of the Company\u2019s lines of business. The Company relies on a combination of trade secret, patent, trademark, copyright and other laws, license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect its intellectual property rights; however, some countries\u2019 laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent U.S. laws do.\nThe Company\u2019s business could be significantly harmed if it is not able to protect its intellectual property, or if a court found it to be infringing on other persons\u2019 intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property lawsuits or threatened lawsuits in which the Company is involved, either as a plaintiff or as a defendant, could cost the Company a significant amount of time and money and distract management\u2019s attention from operating the Company\u2019s business. In addition, if the Company does not prevail on any intellectual property claims, then it may have to change its manufacturing processes, products or trade names, any of which could reduce its profitability. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s branded footwear operations are operated pursuant to licensing agreements with third-party trademark owners. These agreements are subject to early termination for breach. Expiration or early termination by the licensor of any of these license agreements could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to attract and retain executive managers and other key employees, or the loss of one or more executive managers or other key employees, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company depends on its executive management and other key employees. In the footwear, apparel and consumer-direct industries, competition for key executive talent is intense, and the Company\u2019s failure to identify, attract or retain executive managers or other key employees could adversely affect its business. The Company must offer and maintain competitive compensation packages to effectively recruit and retain such individuals. Further, the loss of one or more executive managers or other key employees, or the Company\u2019s failure to successfully implement succession planning, could adversely affect the Company, its results of operations or financial position.\nRegulatory and other changes may lead to higher employment and pension costs for the Company.\nChanges in employment laws and regulations, and other factors could increase the Company\u2019s overall employment costs. The Company\u2019s employment costs include costs relating to health care and retirement benefits, including U.S.-based defined benefit pension plans. The annual cost of benefits can vary significantly depending on a number of factors, including changes in the assumed or actual rate of return on pension plan assets, a change in the discount rate or mortality assumptions used to determine the annual service cost related to the defined benefit plans, a change in the method or timing of meeting pension funding obligations and the rate of health care cost inflation. Increases in the Company\u2019s overall employment and pension costs could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company\u2019s marketing programs, e-commerce initiatives and use of consumer information are governed by an evolving set of laws, industry standards and enforcement trends and unfavorable changes in those laws, standards or trends, or the Company\u2019s failure to comply with existing or future laws, could substantially harm the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company collects, maintains and uses data provided to it through its online activities and other consumer interactions in its business. The Company\u2019s current and future marketing programs depend on its ability to collect, maintain and use this information, and its ability to do so is subject to certain contractual restrictions in third party contracts as well as evolving international, federal and state laws, industry standards and enforcement trends. The Company strives to comply with all applicable laws and other legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, including those relating to the use of data for marketing purposes. It is possible, however, that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another, may conflict with other rules or may conflict with the Company\u2019s practices. If so, the Company may suffer damage to its reputation and be subject to proceedings or actions against it by governmental entities or others. Any such proceeding or action could hurt the Company\u2019s reputation, force it to spend significant amounts to defend its practices, distract its management, increase its costs of doing business, and result in monetary liability.\nIn addition, as data privacy and marketing laws change, the Company may incur additional costs to ensure it remains in compliance. If applicable data privacy and marketing laws become more restrictive at the federal or state level, the Company\u2019s compliance costs may increase, the Company\u2019s ability to effectively engage customers via personalized marketing may decrease, its opportunities for growth may be curtailed by its compliance capabilities or reputational harm and its potential liability for security breaches may increase.\nBecause the Company processes and transmits payment card information, the Company is subject to the Payment Card Industry (\u201cPCI\u201d) Data Security Standard (the \u201cStandard\u201d), and card brand operating rules (\u201cCard Rules\u201d). The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security that was developed by the PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. The Company is required by payment card network rules to comply with the Standard, and the Company\u2019s failure to do so may result in fines or restrictions on its ability to accept payment cards. Under certain circumstances specified in the payment card network rules, the Company may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments or other assessments of its compliance with the Standard. Such activities may reveal that the Company has failed to comply with the Standard. If an audit, self-assessment or other test determines that the Company needs to take steps to remediate any deficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract the Company\u2019s management team and require it to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts. In addition, even if the Company complies with the Standard, there is no assurance that it will be protected from a security breach. Further, changes in technology and processing procedures may result in changes in the Card Rules. Such changes may require the Company to make significant investments in operating systems and technology that may impact business. Failure to keep up with changes in technology could result in loss of business. Failure to comply with the Standard or Card Rules could result in loosing certification under the PCI standards and an inability to process payments.\nDisruption of the Company\u2019s information technology systems could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s information technology systems are critical to the operations of its business. Any interruption, unauthorized access, impairment or loss of data integrity or malfunction of these systems could severely impact the Company\u2019s business, including delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency in operations. In addition, costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems, or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of the Company\u2019s operations. Disruption to the Company\u2019s information technology systems may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar events or disruptions. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could prevent access to the Company\u2019s online services and preclude store transactions. System failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, transactions processing and financial reporting. Additionally, the Company may be materially adversely affected if it is unable to improve, upgrade, maintain, and expand its technology systems.\nThe Company\u2019s and its vendors\u2019 databases containing personal information and payment card data of the Company\u2019s customers, employees and other third parties, could be breached, which could subject the Company to adverse publicity, litigation, fines and expenses. If the Company is unable to comply with bank and payment card industry standards, its operations could be adversely affected.\nThe protection of the Company\u2019s customer, associate and Company data is critically important to the Company. The Company relies on its networks, databases, systems and processes, as well as those of third parties such as vendors, to protect its proprietary information and information about its customers, employees and vendors. The Company\u2019s customers and associates have a high expectation that the Company will adequately safeguard and protect their sensitive personal information. The Company has become increasingly centralized and dependent upon automated information technology processes. In addition, a portion of the Company\u2019s business operations is conducted electronically, increasing the risk of attack or interception that could cause loss or misuse of data, system failures or disruption of operations. If unauthorized parties gain access to these networks or databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify the Company\u2019s private and sensitive third-party or employee information. Improper activities by third parties, exploitation of encryption technology, new data-hacking tools and discoveries and other events or developments may result in a future compromise or breach of the Company\u2019s networks, payment card terminals or other payment systems. In particular, the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target; accordingly, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. Any failure to maintain the security of the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 sensitive information, or data belonging to it or its suppliers, could put it at a competitive disadvantage, result in deterioration of its customers\u2019 confidence in it, and subject it to potential litigation, liability, fines and penalties, resulting in a possible material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operations. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses and would not remedy damage to its reputation. In addition, employees may intentionally or inadvertently cause data or security breaches that result in unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. In such circumstances, the Company could be held liable to its customers, other parties or employees, be subject to regulatory or other actions for breaching privacy laws or failing to adequately protect such information or respond to a breach. This could result in costly investigations and litigation, civil or criminal penalties, operational changes and negative publicity that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation and its results of operations and financial position. In addition, if the Company is unable to comply with bank and payment card industry security standards, it may be subject to fines, restrictions and expulsion from card acceptance programs, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s consumer-direct operations.\nIf the Company encounters problems affecting its logistics and distribution systems, its ability to deliver its products to the market could be adversely affected.\nThe Company relies on owned or independently operated distribution facilities to transport, warehouse and ship products to its customers. The Company\u2019s logistic and distribution systems include computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations. Therefore, its operations could be interrupted by earthquakes, floods, fires or other natural disasters near its distribution centers. The Company's business interruption insurance may not adequately protect the Company from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions affecting its distribution facilities, such as the long-term loss of customers or an erosion of brand image. In addition, the Company\u2019s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the transportation of products to and from the Company\u2019s distribution facilities. If the Company encounters problems affecting its distribution system, its ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company faces risks associated with its growth strategy and acquiring businesses.\nThe Company has expanded its products and markets in part through strategic acquisitions, and it may continue to do so in the future, depending on its ability to identify and successfully pursue suitable acquisition candidates. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including risks inherent in entering new markets in which the Company may not have prior experience; potential loss of significant customers or key personnel of the acquired business; managing geographically-remote operations; and potential diversion of management\u2019s attention from other aspects of the Company\u2019s business operations. Acquisitions may also cause the Company to incur debt or result in dilutive issuances of its equity securities, write-offs of goodwill and substantial amortization expenses associated with other intangible assets. The Company may not be able to obtain financing for future acquisitions on favorable terms, making any such acquisitions more expensive. Any such financing may have terms that restrict the Company\u2019s operations. The Company cannot provide assurance that it will be able to successfully integrate the operations of any acquired businesses into its operations and achieve the expected benefits of any acquisitions. The failure to successfully integrate newly acquired businesses or achieve the expected benefits of strategic acquisitions in the future could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position. The Company may not consummate a potential acquisition for a variety of reasons, but it may nonetheless incur material costs in the preliminary stages of such an acquisition that it cannot recover.\nMaintenance and growth of the Company\u2019s business depends upon the availability of adequate capital.\nThe maintenance and growth of the Company\u2019s business depends on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn depends in large part on cash flow generated by the Company\u2019s business and the availability of equity and debt financing. The Company cannot provide assurance that its operations will generate positive cash flow or that it will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, the Company cannot provide assurance that it will be able to finance any expansion plans.\nExpanding the Company\u2019s brands into new markets and expanding its consumer-direct operations may be difficult and costly, and unsuccessful efforts to do so may adversely affect the Company\u2019s brands and business.\nAs part of the Company\u2019s growth strategy, it seeks to enhance the positioning of its brands, to extend its brands into complementary product categories, to expand geographically and to expand its consumer-direct operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully implement any or all of these growth strategies, and unsuccessful efforts to do so could have an adverse effect on its results of operations and financial position.\nPart of the future growth of the Company\u2019s consumer-direct operations is significantly dependent on the Company\u2019s ability to operate stores in desirable locations at reasonable lease costs and to invest in eCommerce and mobile platforms that drive sales growth through these channels. The Company cannot be sure as to when or whether desirable brick and mortar locations will become available at reasonable costs or whether its eCommerce and mobile platforms will be successful. Further, if the Company is unable to renew or replace its existing store leases or enter into leases for new stores at attractive locations on favorable terms, or if the Company violates any of the terms of its current leases, its growth and profitability could be harmed.\nAn impairment of goodwill or other acquired intangibles could have an adverse material impact to the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. The carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trade names and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to the Company\u2019s cash flows are not amortized, but must be evaluated by the Company at least annually for impairment. If the carrying amounts of one or more of these assets are not recoverable based upon discounted cash flow and market-approach analyses, the carrying amounts of such assets are impaired by the estimated difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value. An impairment charge could materially affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThere is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully implement the recently-announced Realignment Plan.\nOn July 9, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a realignment of the Company\u2019s consumer-direct operations (\"the 2014 Plan\"). As a part of the 2014 Plan, the Company intends to close certain retail stores over the next 12 months, consolidate certain consumer-direct support functions and implement certain other organizational changes. There can be no assurance that the Company will successfully implement the 2014 Plan within the estimated range of charges, within the estimated time frame, or that the Company will realize some or all of the estimated profitability improvements or other benefits from the 2014 Plan. There is also no assurance that the Company will be able to re-invest any future cost savings generated from the 2014 Plan into other initiatives or that any such investment will improve the Company\u2019s operations.\nChanges in government regulation may increase the Company\u2019s costs of compliance and failure to comply with government regulations or other standards may adversely affect its brands and business.\nThe Company\u2019s business is affected by changes in government and regulatory policies in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. New requirements relating to product safety and testing and new environmental requirements, as well as changes in tax laws, duties, tariffs and quotas, could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s ability to produce and market footwear at competitive prices. Failure to comply with such regulations, as well as comply with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards, could also jeopardize the Company\u2019s reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts. Any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for the Company\u2019s products. Damage to the Company\u2019s reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild its reputation and brand value.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to environmental and workplace safety laws and regulations, and costs or claims related to these requirements could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air, soil and water, the management and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, employee exposure to hazards in the workplace, and the investigation and remediation of contamination resulting from releases of hazardous materials. Failure to comply with legal requirements could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. The Company may incur investigation, remediation or other costs related to releases of hazardous materials or other environmental conditions\nat its currently or formerly owned or operated properties, regardless of whether such environmental conditions were created by the Company or a third-party, such as a prior owner or tenant. The Company has incurred, and continues to incur, costs to address soil and groundwater contamination at some locations. If such issues become more expensive to address, or if new issues arise, they could increase the Company\u2019s expenses, generate negative publicity, or otherwise adversely affect the Company.\nThe disruption, expense and potential liability associated with existing and future litigation against the Company could adversely affect its reputation, financial position or results of operations.\nThe Company is a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to its business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, the Company cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are expensive and may require that the Company devote substantial resources and executive time to the defense of such proceedings.\nProvisions of Delaware law and the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws could prevent or delay a change in control or change in management that could be beneficial to the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nProvisions of the Delaware Corporations law, as well as the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of the Company. These provisions are intended to provide the Company\u2019s Board of Directors with continuity and also serves to encourage negotiations between the Board and any potential hostile acquiror. Such provisions include a Board of Directors that is classified so that only one-third of directors stand for election each year. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions that may be beneficial to the Company's stockholders.\nThere are risks, including stock market volatility, inherent in owning the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe market price and volume of the Company\u2019s common stock have been, and may continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations. These fluctuations may arise from general stock market conditions, the impact of risk factors described in this Item 1A on the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations, or a change in opinion in the market regarding the Company\u2019s business prospects or other factors, many of which may be outside the Company\u2019s immediate control. Changes in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases or dividends also could adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s indebtedness could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s current indebtedness could adversely affect the Company by decreasing its business flexibility and increasing its borrowing costs. The Company has debt outstanding under a senior secured credit agreement (\"Credit Agreement\") and has senior notes outstanding that may be traded in the public market. The Credit Agreement and the indenture governing the senior notes contain customary restrictive covenants imposing operating and financial restrictions on the Company, including restrictions that may limit the Company\u2019s ability to engage in acts that may be in its long-term best interests. These covenants restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things: incur or guarantee indebtedness; incur liens; pay dividends or repurchase stock; enter into transactions with affiliates; consummate asset sales, acquisitions or mergers; prepay certain other indebtedness; or make investments. In addition, the restrictive covenants in the Credit Agreement require the Company to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests.\nThese restrictive covenants may limit the Company\u2019s ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. The Company\u2019s ability to comply with any financial covenants could be materially affected by events beyond its control, and there can be no assurance that the Company will satisfy any such requirements. If the Company fails to comply with these covenants, it may need to seek waivers or amendments of such covenants, seek alternative or additional sources of financing or reduce its expenditures. The Company may be unable to obtain such waivers, amendments or alternative or additional financing on favorable terms or at all.", "PERMNO": 42286, "SIC": 3140, "TIC": "WWW"}
