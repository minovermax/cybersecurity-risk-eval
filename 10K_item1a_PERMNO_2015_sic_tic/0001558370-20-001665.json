{"cik": "314489", "company": "FIRST BUSEY CORP /NV/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis section highlights the risks management believes could adversely affect our financial performance. Additional possible risks that could affect the Company adversely and cannot be predicted may arise at any time. Other risks that are immaterial at this time may also have an adverse impact on our future financial condition.\nEconomic and Market Risks\nConditions in the financial market and economic conditions, including conditions in the states in which it operates, generally may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s general financial performance is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where it operates and, in particular, the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services it offers. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment, natural disasters, or a combination of these or other factors.\nWhile economic conditions have both improved and stabilized since the 2008-2009 recession, there can be no assurance that either improvement or stability will continue. Uncertainty regarding continuing economic conditions may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing, and savings habits. Such conditions could adversely affect the credit quality of the Company\u2019s loans, our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there is potential for an increasing federal government debt burden to negatively impact long-term financial stability. U.S. federal government debt held by the public stood at 79% of gross domestic product as of September 2019. The Congressional Budget Office projects that debt burden could increase in an accelerating manner in the coming decades, the impacts of which could include higher interest rates which can lead to slower economic growth, a decrease in government investment as well as a diminished demand for U.S. Treasury bonds. International financial events including slowing economic growth in the euro area and China and the potential for disorderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union could have a direct impact on U.S. markets and consumers.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is also affected by the condition of the markets in which it conducts business. The Company currently conducts its banking operations in downstate Illinois, the Southwest suburbs of Chicago, Illinois, the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area, central Indiana and southwest Florida. The financial condition of the State of Illinois, in which the largest portion of the Company\u2019s customer base resides, is characterized with low credit ratings, pension under-funding, budget deficits and lower job growth rates than most of the country. The Company operates in markets with significant university and healthcare presence, which rely heavily on state and federal funding and contracts. Payment delays by the State of Illinois to its vendors and government-sponsored entities as well as potential federal changes to healthcare laws could affect the Company\u2019s primary market areas, which could in turn adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. Downturns in markets where banking operations occur could result in a decrease in demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, an increase in loan delinquencies and defaults, high or increased levels of problem assets and foreclosures and reduced wealth management fees resulting from lower asset values.\nMarket volatility and changes in interest rates could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nIn certain recent periods, the capital and credit markets experienced heightened volatility and disruption. In some cases, the markets produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers\u2019 underlying financial condition or performance. Conversely, significant increases in the stock markets can also have destabilizing effects. If the capital and credit markets experience these types of heightened levels of disruption and volatility again, both the Company and its customers\u2019 ability to maintain or access capital could be adversely affected which could have an impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates could affect the level of assets and liabilities held on the Company\u2019s balance sheet and the revenue that the Company earns from net interest income, as earnings and profitability depend significantly on our net interest income. Net interest income represents the difference between interest income and fees earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and investment securities and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, including the Federal Open Market Committee. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest the Company receives on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect the Company\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities. In addition, a rise in interest rates could result in decreased demand for first mortgages as well as mortgage refinancing, activities which have historically contributed to a significant portion of the Company\u2019s mortgage revenue. Furthermore, if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and investment securities, the Company\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Finally, when interest rates rise, competition for deposits often increases, which can lead to a change in the Company\u2019s funding mix and cost of funding. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s wealth management business may also be negatively impacted by changes in general economic conditions and the conditions in the financial and securities markets, which could affect the values of assets held under care. Management contracts generally provide for fees payable for wealth management services based on the market value of assets under care. Because most of the Company\u2019s contracts provide for a fee based on market values of securities, declines in securities prices may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations from this business. Market declines and reductions in the value of customers' wealth management accounts, could also result in the loss of wealth management customers, including those who are also banking customers.\nThe recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve have led to the potential for higher inflation and financial instability driven by low borrowing costs that could have a negative effect on financial markets.\nThe Federal Reserve cut rates in 2019 as it sought to offset risks to an otherwise healthy economy exposed to trade uncertainty and slowing global economic growth. The rate cuts were generally supported by most central banks. However, there is potential that the rate cuts could pose additional risks to the economy primarily through higher inflation and financial-stability concerns driven by low borrowing costs. There is a possibility that labor markets could tighten causing inflationary pressures to build faster than the expected gradual pace. There is additional risk that persistently low interest rates could lead consumers and firms to take on riskier financial investments in search of better returns, increasing asset prices to unsustainable levels. The potential rise in asset prices to unsustainable levels could pose potential financial-stability risks in the commercial real estate and corporate borrowing sectors. Sustained low interest rate periods were something that preceded the 1990 and 2007 recessions, placing significant pressure on real estate asset prices through reach-for-yield investor behavior.\nThe transition to an alternative reference rate could cause instability and have a negative effect on financial market conditions.\nLIBOR represents the interest rate at which banks offer to lend funds to one another in the international interbank market for short-term loans. Beginning in 2008, concerns were expressed that some of the member banks surveyed by the British Bankers\u2019 Association in connection with the calculation of LIBOR rates may have been under-reporting or otherwise manipulating the interbank lending rates applicable to them. Regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments have conducted investigations relating to the calculation of LIBOR across a range of maturities and currencies. If manipulation of LIBOR or another inter-bank lending rate occurred, it may have resulted in that rate being artificially lower (or higher) than it otherwise would have been. Responsibility for the calculation of LIBOR was transferred to ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, as independent LIBOR administrator, effective February 1, 2014.\nOn July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR rates after 2021 (the \u201cJuly 27th Announcement\u201d). The July 27th Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to U.S. dollar-LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to LIBOR. The ARRC has proposed a paced-market transition plan to SOFR from U.S. dollar-LIBOR and organizations are working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans relating to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR.\nAt this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable benchmark, whether SOFR or another rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR or the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives on the value of LIBOR-linked securities.\nAlthough the Financial Stability Oversight Council has recommended a transition to an alternative reference rate in the event LIBOR is no longer available after 2021, such plans are still in development and, if enacted, could present challenges. Moreover, contracts linked to LIBOR are vast in number and value, are intertwined with numerous financial products and services, and have diverse parties. The downstream effect of unwinding or transitioning such contracts could cause instability and negatively impact the financial markets and individual institutions. The uncertainty surrounding the sustainability of LIBOR more generally could undermine market integrity and threaten individual financial institutions and the U.S. financial system more broadly.\nThe Company could recognize losses on debt securities held in its securities portfolio, particularly if interest rates increase or economic and market conditions deteriorate.\nFactors beyond the Company\u2019s control may significantly influence the fair value of securities in its investment portfolio and may cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. For example, fixed-rate securities acquired by the Company are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise. A change in the fair value of securities could cause an other-than-temporary impairment (\u201cOTTI\u201d) in future periods and result in realized losses.\nThe process for determining whether a security has experienced OTTI usually requires difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting interest rates, the financial condition of issuers of the securities and the performance of the underlying collateral, we may recognize realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDowngrades in the credit ratings of one or more insurers that provide credit enhancements for the Company\u2019s state and municipal securities portfolio may have an adverse impact on the market for and valuation of these types of securities.\nThe Company invests in tax-exempt state and local municipal securities, some of which are insured by monoline insurers. In recent years, several of these insurers have come under scrutiny by rating agencies. Even though management generally purchases municipal securities on the overall credit strength of the issuer, the reduction in the credit rating of an insurer may negatively impact the market for and valuation of the Company\u2019s investment securities. A downgrade or a default by an issuer could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies, such as the implementation of tariffs, and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. government continues to engage in trade negotiations with certain foreign countries or entities including Mexico, Canada, China, and the European Union. The U.S. government previously implemented tariffs on certain\nproducts while foreign entities or countries have issued or continue to threaten retaliatory tariffs against products from the U.S., including agricultural products. Additional tariffs and retaliatory tariffs may be imposed in the future by the U.S. and these and other countries. Tariffs, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that our customers import or export, including among others, agricultural products, could cause the prices of our customers\u2019 products to increase which could reduce demand for such products, or reduce our customer\u2019s margins, and adversely impact their revenues, financial results and ability to service debt, which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on us or on the markets in which we operate, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in the future.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nThe financial services industry, as well as the broader economy, may be subject to new legislation, regulation, and government policy.\nAt this time, it is difficult to predict future legislative and regulatory changes. Although both the President and senior members of Congress have advocated for and successfully passed some reductions of financial services regulation, exactly which regulatory changes will be pursued in the future, as well as the timing and extent of regulatory changes that could be enacted, remains uncertain. New appointments to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve may affect monetary policy and interest rates, and changes in fiscal policy could affect broader patterns of trade and economic growth. Future legislation, regulation, and government policy could affect the banking industry as a whole, including our business and results of operations, in ways that are difficult to predict. In addition, our results of operations also could be adversely affected by changes in the way in which existing statutes and regulations are interpreted or applied by courts and government agencies.\nAs the Company continues to grow in asset size and complexity, regulatory expectations and scrutiny will likely increase and could have a potential impact on the Company\u2019s operations and business.\nThe Company has grown steadily over the past 5 years, increasing through both organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Further, in 2019, the Company began operations of First Busey Risk Management, a captive insurance company. As financial institutions grow, so do the expectations of regulatory agencies regarding the financial institution\u2019s ability to control for increasingly complex and sophisticated business operations. Certain regulations and laws have embedded asset thresholds that change regulatory expectations, have different financial statement impacts, require different committee and management compositions, or enhanced reporting requirements. For example, the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act limits the amount of interchange fees that banks with assets of $10.0 billion or more may charge to process electronic debit transactions. Banks must begin complying with the Durbin Amendment no later than July 1 of the next calendar year after the bank crosses the $10.0 billion threshold. While we do not currently have $10.0 billion or more in total consolidated assets, we have begun analyzing these requirements to ensure we are prepared to comply with the rules when and if they become applicable. There is potential that changes in the regulatory expectations from asset growth could impact the business operationally, strategically, or financially.\nLegislative and regulatory reforms applicable to the financial services industry, as well as heightened focus on particular regulations, may have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe laws, regulations, rules, policies and regulatory interpretations governing the Company continue to evolve and will likely continue to change over time as Congress and various regulatory agencies react to adverse economic conditions or other matters. The global financial crisis of 2008-2009 served as a catalyst for a number of significant changes in the financial services industry, including the Dodd-Frank Act, which reformed the regulation of financial institutions in a comprehensive manner, and the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, which increase both the amount and quality of capital that financial institutions must hold. The implementation of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry, may impact the profitability of the Company\u2019s business activities and may change certain business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make\nloans, and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose the Company to additional expense, including increased compliance costs.\nThese rule and regulatory changes may also require the Company to invest significant management attention and resources so as to make necessary changes to operations in order to comply. In addition to the expense and uncertainty related to increased regulation, the financial services industry in recent years has faced more intense scrutiny from regulatory agencies in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels, particularly with respect to mortgage-related practices and other consumer compliance matters, and compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, anti-money laundering laws, and the USA Patriot Act, which focuses on money laundering in the form of terrorist financing. Federal law grants substantial enforcement powers to financial services\u2019 regulators including, among other things, the ability to assess significant civil or criminal monetary penalties, fines or restitution; to issue cease and desist orders; and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations. These enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws or regulations and for unsafe or unsound practices. If the Company were the subject of an enforcement action, it could have an adverse impact on the Company.\nEvolving law impacting cannabis-related businesses in Illinois may have an impact on the Company\u2019s operations and risk profile.\nThe Controlled Substances Act makes it illegal under federal law to manufacture, distribute, or dispense marijuana. Starting January 1, 2020, however, the Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act began permitting adults to legally purchase marijuana for recreational use from licensed dispensaries. It is the Bank\u2019s current practice to avoid knowingly providing banking products or services to entities or individuals that: (i) directly or indirectly manufacture, distribute, or dispense marijuana or hemp products, or those who have a significant financial interest in such entities; and (ii) derive a significant percentage of revenue from providing products or services to, or other involvement with, such entities. The Bank is taking reasonable measures, including appropriate new account screening and customer due diligence measures, to ensure that existing and potential customers do not engage in any such activities. Nonetheless, the shift in Illinois law is increasing the number of direct and indirect cannabis-related businesses in Illinois, and therefore increasing the likelihood that the Bank could interact with such businesses, as well as their owners and employees. Such interactions could create additional legal, regulatory, strategic, and reputational risk to the Bank and the Company.\nCredit and Lending Risks\nHeightened credit risk associated with lending activities may result in insufficient loan loss provisions, which could have material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThere are risks in making any loan, including risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, risks of nonpayment, risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and cash flows available to service debt and risks resulting from economic and market conditions. The Company attempts to reduce its credit risk through loan application approval procedures, monitoring the concentration of loans within specific industries and geographic location, and periodic independent reviews of outstanding loans by its loan review and audit departments as well as external parties. However, while such procedures help reduce risks, they cannot be expected to completely eliminate the Company\u2019s credit risks. Borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans for any of a variety of reasons resulting in a rise in the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies and/or a need for increases in the provision for loan losses.\nThe Company estimates and establishes reserves for loan losses and maintains them at a level considered adequate by management to absorb probable loan losses based on a continual analysis of the Company\u2019s portfolio and market environment. These reserves represent the Company\u2019s estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and are based upon other relevant information available.\nIn 2016, the FASB published CECL, which requires recording loss estimates for the life of the instrument for loans, a change from the 40-year standard in which losses are recorded under the \u201cincurred loss\u201d concept. CECL has taken effect for the Company beginning in 2020.\nAlthough management believes the reserves are adequate to absorb losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible, management cannot guarantee that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required in the future. Additional provision could be recorded, either as a result of management\u2019s decision or as a requirement by regulators, to further supplement the reserve for loan losses, particularly if economic conditions unfold in a manner which differs significantly from what management currently expects. Additional provisions in excess of the Company\u2019s current reserves may adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNon-performing assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition and could result in further losses in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s non-performing assets adversely affect its net income in various ways. While the Company pays interest expense to fund non-performing assets, it does not record interest income on non-accrual loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting its income and returns on assets and equity. In addition, loan administration costs increase and the Company\u2019s efficiency ratio is adversely affected. When the Company takes collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, it is required to mark the collateral to its then-fair market value, which, when compared to the outstanding balance of the loan, may result in a loss. Non-performing loans and other real estate owned also increase the Company\u2019s risk profile and the capital its regulators believe is appropriate in light of such risks. The resolution of non-performing assets requires significant time commitments from management, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. The Company cannot guarantee that it will not experience increases in non-performing loans in the future, and its non-performing assets may result in further losses in the future.\nConcentrations of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses.\nThe Company may have higher credit risk, or experience higher credit losses, to the extent its loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or geographic location of the borrower or collateral. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio is made up of mortgage, commercial and industrial loans, and secured by real estate. Thus, deterioration in economic conditions or real estate values could result in higher credit costs and losses to the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most often, this collateral is accounts receivable, inventory, machinery or real estate. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, which the Company requires whenever appropriate on commercial loans. As a result, in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. The collateral securing other loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. As a result of the larger average size of each commercial loan as well as collateral that is generally less readily-marketable, losses incurred on a small number of commercial loans could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAs previously noted, a significant portion of the Company\u2019s loans are collateralized by real estate. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the area in which the real estate is located. Adverse changes affecting real estate values and the liquidity of real estate in one or more markets could increase the credit risk associated with the Company\u2019s loan portfolio and could result in losses which would adversely affect profitability. Mortgage loans in the Company\u2019 portfolio with high loan-to-value ratios are more sensitive to declining property values and may experience a higher incident of default and severity of losses. Adverse changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity generally, and in markets in which the Company has banking operations, could significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect the Company\u2019s ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. Collateral may have to be sold for less than the outstanding balance of the loan which would result in losses.\nCredit risk associated with concentration of securities in the Company\u2019s investment portfolio may increase the potential for loss.\nThe Company\u2019s investment portfolio consists, in part, of securities issued by government or government sponsored agencies and non-government entities. A downturn in the financial condition of the issuers, the performance of the underlying collateral, or the financial condition of the individual mortgagors with respect to the underlying securities could create results such as rating agency downgrades of the securities and default by issuers or individual mortgagors. Any of the foregoing factors could cause an OTTI in future periods and result in realized losses, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nReal estate construction, land acquisition and development loans are based upon estimates of costs and values associated with the complete project. These estimates may be inaccurate, and the Company may be exposed to significant losses on loans for these projects.\nConstruction, land acquisition, and development loans involve additional risks because funds are advanced upon the security of the project, which is of uncertain value prior to its completion, and costs may exceed realizable values in declining real estate markets. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs and the realizable market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. As a result, construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If the Company\u2019s appraisal of the value of the completed project proves to be overstated or market values or rental rates decline, there may be inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project. If the Company is forced to foreclose on a project prior to or at completion due to a default, there can be no assurance that it will be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs. In addition, the Company may be required to fund additional amounts to complete the project and may have to hold the property for an unspecified period of time while it attempts to dispose of it.\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to home equity lines of credit may increase the potential for loss.\nThe Company\u2019s mortgage loan portfolio consists, in part, of originated and purchased home equity lines of credit. A portion of home equity lines of credit are originated in conjunction with the origination of first mortgage loans eligible for sale in the secondary market, which the Company typically does not service if the loan is sold. By not servicing the first mortgage loans, the Company is unable to track the delinquency status which may indicate whether such loans are at risk of foreclosure by others. In addition, home equity lines of credit are initially offered as \u201crevolving\u201d lines of credit whereby the borrowers are only required to make scheduled interest payments during the initial terms of the loans, which is generally five years. Thereafter, the borrowers no longer have the ability to make principal draws from the lines and the loans convert to a fully-amortizing basis, requiring scheduled principal and interest payments sufficient to repay the loans within a certain period of time, which is generally 10 years. The conversion of a home equity line of credit to a fully amortizing basis presents an increased level of default risk to us since the borrower no longer has the ability to make principal draws on the line, and the amount of the required monthly payment could substantially increase to provide for scheduled repayment of principal and interest.\nCapital and Liquidity Risks\nThe Company is required to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, and if it fails to maintain sufficient capital, whether as a result of losses, inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, its financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, as well as its ability to maintain regulatory compliance would be adversely affected.\nFirst Busey and Busey Bank must meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. The Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, when and if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry and market condition, and governmental activities, many of which are outside the Company\u2019s control, and on its financial\ncondition and performance. Accordingly, the Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to the Company. If it fails to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements, its financial condition, liquidity and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to continue to maintain capital ratios in excess of the amounts necessary to be considered \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d for bank regulatory purposes could affect customer confidence, its ability to grow, its costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, its ability to pay dividends to its stockholders or on outstanding stock, its ability to make acquisitions, and its business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, under FDIC rules, if the Company ceases to meet the requirements to be considered a \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d institution for bank regulatory purposes, the interest rates it pays on deposits and its ability to accept, renew or rollover deposits, particularly brokered deposits, may be restricted.\nLiquidity risks could affect operations and jeopardize the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity is essential to the Company\u2019s business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on liquidity. The Company\u2019s primary sources of funds consist of deposits and funds from sales of investment securities, investment maturities and sales, and cash from operations. Additional liquidity is available through repurchase agreements, brokered deposits, and the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d). Access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize the Company\u2019s activities or on terms that are acceptable to the Company could be impaired by factors that affect it directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nDuring periods of economic turmoil, the financial services industry and the credit markets generally may be materially and adversely affected by significant declines in asset values and depressed levels of liquidity. These and other factors could negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions with other financial institutions, lead to market-wide liquidity problems, loss of depositor, creditor, and counterparty confidence, which could lead to losses or defaults by the Company or by other institutions. Furthermore, regional and community banks generally have less access to the capital markets than do the national and super-regional banks because of their smaller size, limited analyst coverage, and lack of credit rating resulting from significant expense required to obtain it.\nAny decline in available funding and/or capital could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet its expenses, pay dividends to its stockholders, or meet deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on its liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could negatively affect the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be negatively affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and losses of depositor, creditor and counterparty confidence and could lead to losses or defaults by the Company or by other institutions. The Company could experience growth as a result of the difficulties or failures of other banks or government-sponsored financial institutions, which would increase its funding needs.\nIn addition, a prolonged period of illiquidity in the secondary mortgage market, and an increase in interest rates, could reduce the demand for residential mortgage loans and increase investor yield requirements for those loans. As a result, the Company may be at higher risk of retaining a larger portion of mortgage loans than in other environments until they are sold to investors. The Company\u2019s ability to retain fixed-rate residential mortgage loans is limited and could result in a reduction of loan production volumes, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetitive and Strategic Risks\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research reports about us, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If there is limited or no securities or industry analyst coverage of us, the market price for our stock would be negatively impacted. Moreover, if any of the analysts who elect to cover us downgrade our common stock, provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors or if our operating results or prospects do not meet their expectations, the market price of our common stock may decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nThe Company faces strong competition from financial service companies and other companies that offer banking and wealth management services, which could harm its business.\nThe Company currently conducts its banking operations in downstate Illinois, the Southwest suburbs of Chicago, Illinois, St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area, central Indiana and southwest Florida. In addition, the Company currently offers fiduciary and wealth management services, which account for a significant portion of its non-interest income. Many competitors offer the same, or a wider variety of, banking and wealth management services within the Company\u2019s market areas. These competitors include national banks, regional banks and other community banks. The Company also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loan institutions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks and online lenders, and other financial intermediaries. In addition, a number of out-of-state financial intermediaries have opened production offices or otherwise solicit deposits in the Company\u2019s market areas. Also, technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks, or financial technology companies, to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. For example, customers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Customers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. Increased competition in the Company\u2019s markets may result in reduced loans, deposits and commissions and brokers\u2019 fees, as well as reduced net interest margin and profitability. Ultimately, the Company may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. If the Company is unable to attract and retain banking and wealth management customers, it may be unable to grow its loan and deposit portfolios or its wealth management commissions, which could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRapid speed of disruptive innovations enabled by new and emerging technologies and/or other market forces may outpace the Company\u2019s ability to compete.\nMany well-established industries are experiencing significant disruptions created by advances in technologies and changing customer requirements and expectations, thus the ability to quickly recognize the change, and then respond and adapt becomes critical to long-term sustainability. If the Company\u2019s culture does not sufficiently encourage the timely identification and escalation of emerging risk issues, these risks have the potential to significantly affect our core operations and achievement of strategic objectives. Similarly, cultural resistance to change may restrict the Company from making the necessary adjustments to the business model and core operations to remain competitive. Inability to utilize data analytics and \u201cbig data\u201d to achieve market intelligence and increase productivity and efficiency could also significantly affect our operations. Ultimately, if we fall behind in our ability to be adaptive and innovative, sustaining customer loyalty and retention may be increasingly difficult as a result of evolving customer preferences and/or demographic shifts in our existing customer base.\nOur strategy of pursuing acquisitions exposes us to financial, execution and operational risks that could negatively affect us.\nTo help us fulfill our strategic objectives and enhance our earnings, part of our strategy is to supplement organic growth by acquiring other financial institutions in our market areas and in nearby markets. As our capital position and asset quality allow, we may again supplement organic growth through acquisitions, as we did with recent acquisitions. There are risks associated with an acquisition strategy, including the following:\n\u25cf We are exposed to potential asset and credit quality risks and unknown or contingent liabilities of the banks or businesses we acquire. If these issues or liabilities exceed our estimates, our earnings and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\n\u25cf Prices at which acquisitions can be made fluctuate with market conditions. We have experienced times during which acquisitions could not be made in specific markets at prices our management considered acceptable and expect that we will experience this condition in the future in one or more markets.\n\u25cf The acquisition of other entities generally requires integration of systems, procedures and personnel of the acquired entity in order to make the transaction economically feasible. This integration process is complicated and time consuming and can also be disruptive to the customers of the acquired business. If the integration process is not conducted successfully and with minimal effect on the acquired business and its customers, we may not realize the anticipated economic benefits of particular acquisitions within the expected time frame, and we may lose customers or employees of the acquired business. Furthermore, the integration of personnel can be challenging and the likelihood of turnover of personnel from acquired institutions presents potential risks to both operational efficiency as well as customer retention. The Company may also experience greater than anticipated customer losses even if the integration process is successful.\n\u25cf We are subject to due diligence expenses which may not result in an acquisition.\n\u25cf To finance an acquisition, we may borrow funds, thereby increasing our leverage and diminishing our liquidity, or issue capital stock to the sellers in an acquisition or to third-parties to raise capital, which could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders.\n\u25cf The time period in which anticipated benefits of a merger are fully realized may take longer than anticipated, or we may be unsuccessful in realizing the anticipated benefits from mergers and future acquisitions.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may seek to implement new lines of business or offer new products, services or delivery channels within existing lines of business in our current markets or new markets. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible, which could in turn have a material negative effect on our operating results.\nAccounting and Tax Risks\nFinancial statements are created, in part, by assumptions and methods used by management, which, if incorrect, could cause unexpected losses in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is impacted by accounting principles, policies and guidelines. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of assets or liabilities and financial results. Certain accounting policies are critical and require management to make difficult, subjective and complex\njudgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If such estimates or assumptions underlying the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements are incorrect, the Company may experience material losses.\nOne such assumption and estimate is the valuation analysis of its goodwill and other intangible assets. Although the Company\u2019s analysis does not indicate impairments exist; the Company is required to perform additional impairment assessments on at least an annual basis, and perhaps more frequently, which could result in further impairment charges. Any future goodwill or other intangible assets impairment charges, based on the current balances or future balances arising out of acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations by reducing net income or increasing net losses.\nThe Company is subject to changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines.\nPeriodically, agencies such as the FASB or the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s Financial Statements. These changes are beyond the Company\u2019s control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how the Company reports its financial condition and results of operations. Changes in these standards are continuously occurring and the implementation of such changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2016, the FASB published CECL, which requires recording loss estimates for the life of the instrument for loans and held-to-maturity investment securities. This is a change from the 40-year standard in which losses are recorded under the \u201cincurred loss\u201d concept. The CECL methodology estimates losses in consideration of a reasonably foreseeable economic forecast. CECL has taken effect for the Company beginning in 2020 and could introduce significant earnings volatility compared to the \u201cincurred loss\u201d concept. The ongoing impacts of CECL will be dependent upon changes in economic conditions and forecasts, loan origination volumes, originated and acquired loan portfolio composition, portfolio duration, and other factors.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax law and may not realize tax benefits which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws at national or state levels could have an effect on the Company\u2019s short-term and long-term earnings. Tax law changes are both difficult to predict and are beyond the Company\u2019s control. Changes in tax laws could affect the Company\u2019s earnings as well as its customers\u2019 financial positions, or both.\nDeferred tax assets are designed to reduce subsequent period\u2019s income tax expense and arise, in part, as a result of net loss carry-overs, and other book accounting to tax accounting differences including expected credit losses, stock-based compensation, and deferred compensation. Such items are recorded as assets when it is anticipated the tax consequences will be recorded in future periods. A valuation allowance is established against a deferred tax asset when it is unlikely the future tax effects will be realized. Significant judgment by management about matters that are by nature uncertain is required to record a deferred tax asset and establish a valuation allowance.\nIn evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, the Company estimates future taxable income based on management forecasts and tax planning strategies that may be available to us. While the Company has determined that no valuation allowance is currently required for any deferred tax assets, if future events differ significantly from our current forecasts, it may need to establish a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets, which would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition. In addition, current portions of the net deferred tax assets relate to tax effected state net operating loss carry-forward, the utilization of which may be further limited in the event of certain material changes in the Company\u2019s ownership.\nIn addition, changes in ownership could further limit the Company\u2019s realization of deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods prior to the expiration of the related net operating losses and may be limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. If the Company undergoes an ownership change, its ability to use net operating loss carry-forwards, tax credit carry-forwards\nor net unrealized built-in losses at the time of ownership change may be limited. The limitation may affect the amount of the Company\u2019s deferred income tax asset and, depending on the limitation, a portion of its built-in losses.\nFurther, the Company invests in certain tax-advantaged projects promoting affordable housing, community development and other community revitalization projects. These projects are designed to generate return primarily though federal and state tax credits. The ultimate realization is dependent upon having sufficient taxable income and other factors outside of the Company\u2019s control, including changes in tax laws and the ability of the projects to be completed.\nOperational Risks\nThe Company relies on the integrity of its operating systems and employees, and those of third-parties and certain failures of such systems or error by employees or customers could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations.\nCommunications and information systems are essential to conduct the Company\u2019s business, as it uses such systems to manage customer transactions and relationships, the general ledger, and deposits, loans, and investments. However, the computer systems and network infrastructure the Company uses could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems as operations are dependent upon the protection of computer equipment against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches, cybersecurity attacks, viruses and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. The termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based could also interrupt our operations.\nIn addition, the Company outsources certain processing functions to third-party providers. If third-party providers encounter difficulties or if the Company has difficulty in communicating with them, the ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions may be affected and business operations may be adversely impacted. If third-party providers are unable to meet service expectations, experience system or processing failure, or incur disruptions affecting operations, results could adversely impact the Company. Moreover, it may be difficult for the Company to replace third party vendors, particularly vendors providing core banking and information services, in a timely manner if they are unwilling or unable to provide the Company with these services in the future or for any reason and, even if the Company is able to replace them, it may be at higher cost or result in the loss of customers. While the Company follows certain due diligence procedures in reviewing and vetting its third-parties, it cannot control their actions.\nAlthough the Company has procedures in place to prevent or limit the effects of any of these potential problems and intends to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such occurrences, technology-related disruptions, failures and cybersecurity risks are a constant threat, both for the Company and for the third-parties it works with. Therefore, it cannot guarantee that these measures will be successful. Any failure, interruption in, or breach in security of, its computer systems and network infrastructure, as well as those of its customers engaging in internet banking activities or electronic funds transfers, could damage its reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose it to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nSimilarly, the Company is reliant upon its employees. Such dependencies create risks for potential losses resulting from employee errors, breakdowns in process or control, failures to properly execute change management, negligence, or a number of other factors outside the Company\u2019s control. The Company maintains a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors, customer or employee fraud and other disruptions which might impact its business. In addition, the Company\u2019s Internal Audit department routinely reviews operations and high-risk areas for error, deficient controls, and failure to adhere to policy.\nPotential legal actions, fines and civil money penalties could arise as results of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity.\nA breach in the security of the Company\u2019s systems could disrupt its businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage its reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure for the Company.\nAlthough the Company devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade systems and processes designed to protect the security of its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets, these measures do not provide absolute security. Several financial services institutions, government agencies, retailers and other companies have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means.\nSome companies in the U.S. have experienced well-publicized attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced third-parties that were intended to disrupt normal business activities by making internet banking systems inaccessible to customers for extended periods. These \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d attacks may not have breached data security systems, but require substantial resources to defend, and may affect customer satisfaction and behavior. Even if not directed at the Company, attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system could adversely affect, directly or indirectly, aspects of the Company\u2019s businesses.\nThreats to security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other third-parties, their personnel, and their use of subcontractors. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms the Company and its third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data. Such cyber incidents may go undetected for a period of time. An inability by our third-party providers to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, breaches of security could result in a number of negative events, including losses to us or our clients, loss of business or clients, damage to our reputation, the incurrence of additional expenses, additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties or exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company also faces risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches in connection with credit card and debit card transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding the Company\u2019s customers through various third-parties, including merchant acquiring banks, payment processors, payment card networks and its processors. Because card transactions involve third-parties and environments such as the point of sale that the Company does not control or secure, future security breaches or cyber-attacks affecting any of these third-parties could impact the Company through no fault of its own, and in some cases it may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them. Cyber-attacks or other breaches, whether affecting the Company or others, could intensify consumer concern and regulatory focus and result in reduced use of payment cards and increased costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nPenetration or circumvention of the Company\u2019s security systems could result in serious negative consequences for the Company, including significant disruption of the Company\u2019s operations, misappropriation of confidential information of the Company or that of its customers or employees, or damage to computers or systems of the Company and those of its customers and counterparties. Such events could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Company or its customers, loss of confidence in the Company\u2019s security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, all of which would adversely affect the Company.\nThese risks have increased for all financial institutions globally as new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies, including mobile devices, to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. Despite the Company\u2019s significant investment in security resources and its continued efforts to prevent or limit the effects of potential threats, it is possible that the Company may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventative measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security-related attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties, including parties sponsored by hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, third-party service providers\nor other users of the Company\u2019s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the Company\u2019s data or that of its customers. These risks may increase in the future as the Company increases its mobile payments, internet-based product offerings, and expand its internal usage of web-based products and applications.\nCustomer or employee fraud may affect operations, result in significant financial loss, and have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s reputation.\nMisconduct could subject the Company to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm its reputation. Misconduct by employees and customers could include hiding unauthorized activities, conducting improper or unauthorized activities or improper use of confidential information. It is not possible to prevent all errors and misconduct, and the precautions the Company takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases.\nCustomer or other outsiders may also attempt to perpetuate fraud or scams in the form of identity theft, money laundering, fraudulent or altered deposits, or use of counterfeit instruments, as a few examples. The Company also faces fraud risk associated with the origination of loans, including the intentional misstatement of information in property appraisals or other underwriting documentation provided to it by customers or by third-parties. Customers may expose the Company to certain fraud risks associated with the compromise of their computing systems or accounts, as well.\nShould the Company\u2019s internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, such failures could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. Both the number and sophistication level of attempted fraudulent transactions are increasing. Should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence of fraud, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain management and key personnel may affect future growth and earnings and legislation imposing new compensation restrictions could adversely affect its ability to do so.\nMuch of the Company\u2019s success and growth has been influenced strongly by its ability to attract and retain management experienced in banking and financial services and familiar with the communities in its market areas. The Company\u2019s ability to retain executive officers, current management teams, lending and retail banking officers, and administrative staff of its subsidiaries continues to be important to the successful implementation of its strategy. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to retain key personnel at acquired financial institutions is vitally important to the Company\u2019s strategy to grow through mergers and acquisitions. Also critical is the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified staff with the appropriate level of experience and knowledge about its market areas so as to implement its community-based operating strategy. The unexpected loss of services of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nDamage resulting from negative publicity could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and adversely impact its business and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to attract and maintain customers, investors, and employees is contingent upon maintaining trust. Negative public opinion could result from the Company\u2019s actual or alleged conduct in a number of activities, including, but not limited to, employee misconduct, a failure or perceived failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality or to treat customers fairly, faulty lending practices, compliance failures, security breaches, corporate governance, sharing or inadequate protection of customer information, failure to comply with laws or regulations, and actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to that conduct. The results of such actual or alleged misconduct could include customer dissatisfaction, inability to attract potential acquisition prospects, litigation, and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which could lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. No assurance can be made, despite the cost or efforts made by the Company to address the issues arising from reputational harm, that results could not adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of terrorism or war, widespread disease or pandemics or other adverse external events could significantly impact the Company\u2019s business.\nAs the Company\u2019s operating and market footprint continues to grow, severe weather, natural disasters, acts of terrorism or war, widespread disease or pandemics and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business. The Company\u2019s current footprint poses a wide variety of potential adverse events that could impact the Company in various ways. In addition, such events could affect the stability of the Company\u2019s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. The occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operation.\nThe Company\u2019s framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.\nThe Company\u2019s risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss. It has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, and analyze the types of risk to which it is subject, compliance risk and reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations. Risks may exist, or emerge in the future, that have not been appropriately identified or anticipated. As it continues to grow, the Company\u2019s ability to successfully identify and manage the risks it faces is an important factor that can significantly impact results. If its risk management framework proves ineffective, the Company could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 86382, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BUSE"}
