{"cik": "1091596", "company": "Nuo Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-10-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company faces many risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks the Company faces. Additional risks not yet known or currently believed to be immaterial may also impair our business. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our New Common Stock, if and when it resumes trading, could decline. You should consider the following risks, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to our securities.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Financial Position, Business and Industry\nWe Have Limited Sources of Working Capital and Our Revenue Base Is Currently Limited to a Single Product Seeking Market Adoption\nWorking capital required to implement our business plan will most likely continue to be provided by funds obtained through offerings of our equity, debt, debt-linked securities, and/or equity-linked securities, and revenues generated by us. As a result of the assignment of our rights, title and interest in and to the Arthrex Agreement pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, the related transfer and assignment of associated intellectual property previously owned by us and licensed under the Arthrex Agreement, as well as rights to collect royalty payments thereunder, we will no longer have any rights to the Angel product line. Our revenue base is therefore currently limited to our Aurix product.\nIf we do not have sufficient working capital and are unable to generate sufficient revenues or raise additional funds, we may delay the completion of, or significantly reduce the scope of, our current business plan; delay some of our development and clinical or marketing efforts; delay our plans to penetrate the market serving Medicare beneficiaries and fulfill the related data gathering requirement as stipulated by the Medicare CED coverage determination; delay the pursuit of commercial insurance reimbursement for our wound treatment technologies; delay any of our other strategic plans; or postpone the hiring of new personnel; or, under certain dire financial circumstances, cease our operations.\nWe May Need Substantial Additional Financing and Our Ability to Effect Such Financing Successfully Is Subject to Limitations\nAt December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.9 million, total current assets of approximately $3.0 million and total current liabilities of approximately $42.2 million. At June 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $6.1 million, total current assets of approximately $8.1 million and total current liabilities of approximately $2.6 million.\nWe may need substantial additional capital to fund our operations. To date, we have relied almost exclusively on financing transactions to fund losses from our operations. If we are unable to increase our revenues significantly or if the Backstop Commitment and other financing sources are unavailable to us, then we may be required to curtail portions of our strategic plan or to cease operations. The Backstop Commitment is, by its terms, only available to us on or after June 30, 2017, and terminates upon the occurrence of certain events.\nThe Certificate of Designations for our Series A Preferred Stock limits the Company\u2019s ability to (i) issue securities that are senior or pari passu with the Series A Preferred Stock, (ii) incur debt (other than for working capital purposes not in excess of $3.0 million) and (iii) issue securities that are junior to the Series A Preferred Stock and that provide certain consent rights to the holders of such junior securities in connection with a liquidation or contain certain liquidation preferences, in each case without the consent of holders representing at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares Series A Preferred Stock.\nAny equity financings may cause substantial dilution to our shareholders and could involve the issuance of securities with rights senior to the New Common Stock. Any debt financings we undertake may require us to comply with onerous financial covenants and restrict our business operations. Our ability to complete additional financings is dependent on, among other things, the state of the capital markets at the time of any proposed offering, market reception of the Company and the likelihood of the success of its business model, of the offering terms, etc. We may not be able to obtain any such additional capital as we need to finance our efforts, through asset sales, equity or debt financing, or any combination thereof, on satisfactory terms or at all. Additionally, any such financing, if at all obtained, may not be adequate to meet our capital needs and to support our operations.\nIf adequate capital cannot be obtained on a timely basis and on satisfactory terms, it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement our business plan, and our revenues and operations and the value of our New Common Stock and common stock equivalents would be materially negatively impacted and we may be forced to curtail or cease our operations.\nWe Have a History of Losses and Expect to Incur Losses for the Foreseeable Future and it is Uncertain Whether Past Losses Will Yield Any Tax Benefits to Us\nWe have a history of losses, are not currently profitable, and expect to incur losses and negative operating cash flows in the future. We may never generate sufficient revenues to achieve and maintain profitability. We will continue to incur expenses at current or increased levels as we seek to expand our operations, pursue development of our technologies, work to increase our sales, implement internal systems and infrastructure, and hire additional personnel. These ongoing financial losses may adversely affect our stock price.\nIn addition, it is uncertain whether we will be able to use any of our pre-bankruptcy net operating losses as an income tax benefit for periods after the Effective Date (we may not be able to use them, for example, if our reorganization and corresponding issuance of New Common Stock is deemed to be an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code), nor can we provide assurances that such net operating losses will not result in income tax penalties.\nWe Have a Short Operating History and Limited Operating Experience\nWe have only in the past few years been implementing our commercialization strategy for Aurix. Thus, we have a very limited operating history. Continued operating losses, together with the risks associated with our ability to gain new customers for Aurix, may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. We may also be forced to respond to unforeseen difficulties, such as decreased demand for our products and services, downward pricing trends, regulatory requirements and unanticipated market pressures. Since emerging from bankruptcy and continuing through today, we are developing a business model that includes either maintaining or addressing third-party reimbursement rates, executing on the elements of the Restorix collaboration, developing and executing a long term sales and marketing program, acquiring synergistic technologies and/or product lines, developing other technologies covered by, or derived from, our intellectual property, and seeking strategic partnerships. Our current business model may not be able to accomplish our stated goals.\nAs a Result of Our Emergence from Bankruptcy and the Application of Fresh-Start Accounting, Our Financial Statements Subsequent to May 5, 2016 Will Not Be Comparable in Many Respects to Our Financial Statements Prior to May 5, 2016\nFollowing the consummation of the Plan of Reorganization, our financial condition and results of operations from and after the Effective Date will not be comparable to the financial condition or results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements due to the Company\u2019s application of fresh-start accounting to time periods beginning on or after May 5, 2016. Fresh-start accounting requires us to adjust the assets and liabilities contained in our financial statements immediately prior to our emergence from bankruptcy protection to their estimated fair values using the acquisition method of accounting. These adjustments are material and will affect our prospective results of operations. As a result, this will make it difficult to assess our performance in relation to prior periods.\nAs a Result of the Transfer of Our Intellectual Property Rights in the Angel Product Line Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, Our Focus Post-Reorganization is on the Successful Execution and Completion of the Clinical Data Registry Protocols of Aurix Under the CMS CED Program and We May Not be Successful with Such Execution and Completion, or With Our Overall Sales and Marketing Strategy for Aurix\nAs a result of the assignment of our rights, title and interest in and to the Arthrex Agreement pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, the related transfer and assignment of associated intellectual property previously owned by us and licensed under the Arthrex Agreement, as well as rights to collect royalty payments thereunder, we no longer hold any rights with respect to the Angel product line. Our corporate and strategic focus is now on the successful execution and completion of the clinical data registry protocols of Aurix under the CMS CED program. Only upon the successful conclusion of those data collection efforts and the submission of the resulting data to CMS can broad access and unhindered commercial reimbursement of Aurix be achieved. And even if we are successful with these data collection efforts and submitting the resulting data to CMS, we can provide no assurances that broad access and commercial reimbursement of Aurix will in fact be achieved.\nFollowing the 2012 determination by the CMS which, in essence, permitted coverage of Aurix under its CED program, we have been expanding efforts to address the Medicare beneficiary population through sales channels that have traditionally not been available to us due to the previously standing non-coverage determination by CMS. The Company\u2019s efforts in these new sales channels may not be successful, and even if successful, they may not yield sufficient sales and profits to realize the Company\u2019s goals and conform to its plans. If and to the extent CMS makes significant changes to its previously issued approval determinations or the currently approved protocols are not enrolled in a timely manner, our sales and marketing strategy may be adversely affected.\nThe Successful Continued Commercialization of Our Aurix System and of Any Future Product Candidates Will Depend on Obtaining Reimbursement from Third-Party Payors\nIn the U.S., the market for any pharmaceutical or biologic product is affected by the availability of reimbursement from third party payors, such as government health administration authorities, private health insurers, health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit management companies. If we cannot demonstrate a favorable cost-benefit relationship, we may have difficulty obtaining adequate reimbursement for our products from these payors. Third-party payors may also deny coverage or offer inadequate levels of reimbursement for any of our products if they determine that the product is experimental, unnecessary or inappropriate. Under such healthcare systems, reimbursement is often a determining factor in predicting a product\u2019s success, with some physicians and patients strongly favoring only those products for which they will be reimbursed.\nThe Aurix System is marketed to healthcare providers. Some of these providers, in turn, seek reimbursement from third-party payers such as Medicare, Medicaid, and other private insurers. We may not be successful with our reimbursement strategy, including, without limitation, obtaining additional necessary CMS or other regulatory approvals. For example, CMS may not determine that the evidence collected under CED is sufficient to provide unrestricted Medicare coverage for the Aurix System and autologous PRP, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If it is later determined that a new randomized, controlled trial is necessary, it could cause us to incur significant incremental costs and take multiple years to complete. We would almost certainly need to obtain additional, outside financing to fund such a trial. In any case, we may never be successful in securing unrestricted Medicare coverage for our products.\nThe most significant growth driver for Aurix is the 2012 NCD from CMS, which reversed an existing twenty year non-coverage decision for autologous blood derived products used in wound care. CMS previously advised us that payment levels for reimbursement claims with respect to Aurix would be reviewed annually and subject to change. Any decision by CMS to decrease payment rates for reimbursement claims will negatively impact the Company's economic value proposition for Aurix in the market for advanced wound care therapies, and could have material adverse effects on the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations. For example, CMS could decide to place Aurix at a different payment classification level (it is currently placed at APC 5054 (Level 4 Skin Procedures)), could decide that the geometric mean cost of the services underlying Aurix is no longer comparable to the geometric mean cost of APC 5054, or could otherwise determine that the national average reimbursement rate for Aurix treatments should be lower than the current $1,411 per treatment. The national average reimbursement rate for calendar year 2016 is significantly higher than it was in calendar years 2015 or 2014 ($430 and $411, respectively).\nShould we seek to expand our commercialization internationally, we would be subject to the international regulations, where the pricing of prescription pharmaceutical products and services and the level of government reimbursement may be subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to twelve months or longer after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct one or more clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. Conducting one or more of these clinical trials would be expensive and result in delays in commercialization of our products.\nManaging and reducing healthcare costs has become a major priority of federal and state governments in the U.S. As a result of healthcare reform efforts, we might become subject to future regulations or other cost-control initiatives that materially restrict the price we can receive for our products. Third-party payors may also limit access and reimbursement for newly approved healthcare products generally or limit the indications for which they will reimburse patients who use any products that we may develop. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price for products that we may develop, which would result in lower product revenues to us.\nOur Collaboration with Restorix, Which Imposes Certain Limitations on Us, May Not Be Successful\nTo advance the commercialization of Aurix for the treatment of chronic wound care in the U.S., we have initiated a collaboration with Restorix, a leading wound care management company operating approximately 125 outpatient wound care facilities generally as a part of a broader hospital facility. The CED data registry protocols require the collection of wound healing data including Quality of Life metrics for a study population of approximately 2,200 total patients across three prospective clinical research studies. The Restorix collaboration is intended to efficiently and effectively enroll these wound care patients in a coordinated manner via a collaborative approach of the two companies. Under the corresponding Collaboration Agreement, we agreed to provide Restorix with certain limited geographic exclusivity benefits over a defined period of time for the usage of the Aurix System in up to 30 of the wound care clinics with which Restorix has a management contract, in exchange for Restorix making minimum commitments of patients enrolled in the three clinical research studies primarily consisting of patient data collection necessary to maintain exclusivity under the Collaboration Agreement. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Our Business - The Aurix System\u201d for additional detail on the terms of the Collaboration Agreement with Restorix.\nWe may be unsuccessful in implementing the Collaboration Agreement. For example, as with all collaborations, we are dependent upon the success of the collaborator in performing its responsibilities and its continued cooperation and engagement. We cannot control the amount and timing of the resources that Restorix will devote to performing its obligations under the Collaboration Agreement. As a result, the enrollment of wound care patients in the clinical research studies may be delayed, which would negatively affect our revenues and cash flows.\nIn addition, the Collaboration Agreement with Restorix places limitations on our ability to partner with other companies. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, during the initial two year term of the Collaboration Agreement: (i) Restorix will have site specific geographic exclusivity for usage of Aurix in connection with treatment of patients in the three protocols within a 30 mile radius of each Restorix partner hospital, and (ii) other than with respect to existing CED sites, the Company will not provide corporate exclusivity with any other wound management company operating in excess of 19 wound care facilities for any similar arrangement.\nWe May Not Be Able to Realize Any Remaining Potential Benefits of the Aldagen Acquisition\nThe acquisition of Aldagen, pursuant to which we acquired the then ongoing ALD-401 RECOVER-Stroke trial and ALDH \u201cBright Cell\u201d platform, represented a significant investment by the Company. In June 2014 we discontinued any further direct funding of the clinical development of the Bright Cell technology. However, the ongoing PACE clinical study in intermittent claudication continued via the direct study funding by NHLBI, while the cell processing and manufacturing of the product candidate was transferred to a third party cell processing lab. The outcome of the PACE study is uncertain. In the absence of positive data from the PACE study in the fourth quarter of 2016, it is unlikely that we will be able to derive significant value from the Bright Cell technology, and even if data are positive, any value we may derive from the Bright Cell technology may not be significant.\nWe Rely on a Single Supplier for the Reagent Used for Aurix and an Interruption in Our Supply Chain Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business\nA reagent used for our Aurix product, bovine thrombin (Thrombin JMI), is available exclusively through Pfizer. Pfizer may unilaterally raise the prices for the reagent. If a temporary or permanent interruption in the supply of the reagent were to occur, or the manufacturing costs charged by Pfizer exceed what we can reasonably afford, it would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAdverse Conditions in the Global Economy and Disruption of Financial Markets May Significantly Restrict Our Ability to Generate Revenues or Obtain Debt or Equity Financing\nThe global economy continues to experience volatility and uncertainty. Such conditions could reduce demand for our products which would significantly jeopardize our ability to achieve meaningful market penetration for Aurix. These conditions could also affect our current and potential strategic partners, which, in turn, could make it much more difficult to execute a strategic collaboration, and therefore significantly jeopardize our ability to fully develop and commercialize our products and product candidates. Global credit and capital markets continue to be relatively challenging. We may be unable to obtain capital through issuance of our equity and/or equity-linked securities, which have been a significant source of funding for us throughout our history. If we are unable to secure funding through strategic collaborations, equity investments, or debt financing, we may not be able to achieve profitability, or fund our research and development, which may result in a cessation of our operations.\nBusiness credit and liquidity have tightened in much of the world. Continuing geopolitical instability and volatility and disruption of financial markets could limit our customers\u2019 ability to obtain adequate financing or credit to purchase and pay for our products in a timely manner, or to maintain operations, and result in a decrease in sales volume. General concerns about the fundamental soundness of domestic and international economies may also cause customers to reduce purchases. Changes in governmental banking, monetary and fiscal policies to restore liquidity and increase credit availability may not be effective. Economic conditions and market turbulence may also impact our suppliers\u2019 ability to supply sufficient quantities of product components in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to fulfill sales orders. It is difficult to determine the extent of the economic and financial market problems and the many ways in which they may affect our suppliers, customers, investors, and business in general. Continuation or further deterioration of these financial and macroeconomic conditions could significantly harm sales, profitability and results of operations.\nOur Intellectual Property Assets Are Critical to Our Success\nWe regard our patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property assets as critical to our success. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, and trade secret and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, and other similar measures, to establish and protect our intellectual property. We attempt to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets by restricting access to sensitive information and requiring employees, consultants, and other persons with access to our sensitive information to sign confidentiality agreements. Despite these efforts, we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter others from developing similar technology in the future. Furthermore, policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property assets is difficult and expensive. Litigation has been necessary in the past and may be necessary in the future in order to protect our intellectual property assets. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in any litigation matter relating to our intellectual property assets. Continuing litigation or other challenges could result in one or more of our patents being declared invalid. In such a case, any royalty revenues from the affected patents would be adversely affected although we may still be able to continue to develop and market our products. Furthermore, the unauthorized use of our patented technology by otherwise potential customers in our target markets may significantly undermine our ability to generate sales. Any infringement or challenge to our patents or other misappropriation of our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase sales of our commercial products and/or continue the development of our pipeline candidates.\nOur Products Are Subject to Governmental Regulation\nOur success is also impacted by factors outside of our control. Our current technology and products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S., both federal and state, and in foreign countries by various regulatory agencies. Specifically, our devices and bio-pharmaceutical products are subject to regulation by the FDA and state regulatory agencies. The FDA regulates drugs, medical devices and biologics that move in interstate commerce and requires that such products receive clearance or pre-marketing approval based on evidence of safety and efficacy. The regulations of government health ministries in foreign countries are analogous to those of the FDA in both application and scope. In addition, any change in current regulatory interpretations by, or positions of, state regulatory officials where our products are used could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell products in those states. The FDA will require us to obtain clearance or approval of new devices when used for treating specific wounds or marketed with specific wound-healing claims, or for other products under development.\nWe believe all our products for sale are legally marketed. As we expand and offer and/or develop additional products in the U.S. and in foreign countries, clearance or approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities prior to introduction of any such products into the market may be required. We provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain all necessary approvals from the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries for these products. Failure to obtain the required approvals would have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nCompliance with FDA and other governmental requirements imposes significant costs and expenses. Further, our failure to comply with these requirements could result in sanctions, limitations on promotional or other business activities, or other adverse effects on our business. Further, recent efforts to control healthcare costs could negatively affect demand for our products and services.\nWe Must Comply With the Physician Payment Sunshine Act\nWe are required to comply with the United States Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologicals and medical supplies that participate in U.S. federal healthcare programs to report certain payments and items of value given to physicians and teaching hospitals. Manufacturers are required to report this information annually to CMS. The period between August 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013 was the first reporting period for which manufacturers were required to report aggregate payment data to CMS by March 31, 2014. While we timely filed our required report under the Sunshine Act for 2014 and 2015, we did not timely file our required report for the initial period, and our failure to do so could subject us to certain fines and penalties as set forth below. Manufacturers are required to report aggregate payment data to CMS by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. If we fail to accurately and timely report this information in the future, we could suffer severe penalties. We cannot assure you that we will collect and report all data timely and accurately. If we fail to accurately report this information, we could suffer severe penalties. Any applicable manufacturer that fails to timely, accurately, or completely report the information required in accordance with the rules of the Sunshine Act is subject to a civil monetary penalty of not less than $1,000, but not more than $10,000, for each payment or other transfer of value or ownership or investment interest not reported timely, accurately or completely (up to $150,000). For \u201cknowing\u201d failures to report, the penalties increase to not less than $10,000, but not more than $100,000, for each such failure (up to $1,000,000). The amount of civil monetary penalties imposed on each applicable manufacturer or applicable group purchasing organization is aggregated separately. Subject to separate aggregate totals, the maximum combined annual total is $1,150,000.\nSeveral of the U.S. states have parallel reporting laws, sometimes accompanied with \u201cgift bans\u201d prohibiting manufacturers from making gifts or other remunerations to prescribers. Massachusetts and Vermont are two such states. There are various penalties associated with noncompliance with the state laws, as well.\nClinical Trials May Fail to Demonstrate the Safety or Efficacy of Our Product Candidates\nOur product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of biotherapeutic products. The results of early-stage clinical trials do not necessarily predict the results of later-stage clinical trials. Product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate desired safety and efficacy traits despite having successfully progressed through initial clinical testing. For example, we discontinued further funding of the ALD-401 development program following results which demonstrated that observed improvements in the primary endpoint of the trial were not clinically or statistically significant. Even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates is promising, this data may not be sufficient to support approval by the U.S. or foreign regulatory agencies. Pre-clinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways. Accordingly, the regulatory officials could reach different conclusions in assessing such data, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, the U.S. regulatory authorities, or we, may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time. Any failure or delay in completing clinical trials for product candidates, or in receiving regulatory approval for the sale of any product candidates, has the potential to materially harm our business, and may prevent it from raising necessary, additional financing that may be needed in the future.\nIf clinical trials of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct, at our own expense, extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, including the following:\n\u00b7 regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u00b7 clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs that we expect to be promising;\n\u00b7 the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u00b7 our third party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner or at all;\n\u00b7 we might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u00b7 regulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u00b7 we may be subject to a more complex regulatory process, since stem cell-based therapies are relatively new and regulatory agencies have less experience with them than with traditional pharmaceutical products;\n\u00b7 the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate; and\n\u00b7 our product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators to halt or terminate the trials.\nA Disruption in Healthcare Provider Networks Could Have an Adverse Effect on Operations and Profitability\nOur operations and future profitability are dependent, in large part, upon the ability to contract with healthcare providers on favorable terms. In any particular service area, healthcare providers could refuse to contract with us or take other actions that could result in higher healthcare costs, or create difficulties in meeting our regulatory requirements. In some service areas, certain healthcare providers may have a significant market presence. If healthcare providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate unfavorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market services or to be profitable in those service areas could be adversely affected. Provider networks could also be disrupted by the financial insolvency of a large healthcare provider group. Any disruption in provider networks could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLiquidity Problems or Bankruptcy of our Key Customers or Collaborators Could Have a Significant Adverse Effect on our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur sales to customers are typically made on credit without collateral. There is a risk that key customers will not pay, or that payment may be delayed, because of bankruptcy, contraction of credit availability to such customers, weak sales or other factors beyond our control, which could increase our exposure to losses from bad debts. In addition, if our key customers were to cease doing business as a result of bankruptcy or significantly reduce their orders from us, it could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, if our collaborators face liquidity problems or file for bankruptcy, they may choose to divert resources away from their continued cooperation and engagement with us or otherwise choose or be forced to reduce operations, which could also have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nWe May Be Unable to Attract a Strategic Partner for the Further Development of Certain of Our Product Candidates\nDue to our limited resources, we have determined that the best vehicle to ultimately commercialize the various potential indications for the ALDH Bright Cell technology, is likely through strategic partnerships, out-licensing, or other similar arrangements. Even if positive clinical data is eventually achieved in future clinical trials, we may not be able to come to any such agreements, or even have the resources necessary to seek such arrangements. Furthermore, even if such a strategic relationship regarding any of our products or product candidates is reached, development milestones, clinical data, or other such benchmarks may not be achieved. Therefore, our products and product candidates may never proceed toward commercialization or drive cash infusions for us, and we may ultimately not be able to monetize the patents, existing clinical data, and other intellectual property.\nOur Efforts to Secure Commercial Partners May Not Be Successful\nFrom time to time, we engage in discussions with larger companies regarding potential strategic partnerships involving the broad commercialization of Aurix. The resources and expertise of such a partner would greatly facilitate the capture of market share within the wound care market, but would require that the economic benefits of such a broad penetration would be shared with said partner. We may not be successful in securing such a partner. Furthermore, even if a partner is secured, the partnership may not attain the market penetration contemplated, and the profits ultimately realized by us, if any, may not be sufficient to allow us to execute our business strategy.\nWe May Use Third-Party Collaborators and Service Providers to Help Us Support, Develop or Commercialize Our Product Candidates, and Our Ability to Commercialize Such Candidates May Be Impaired or Delayed if such Collaborations or Engagements Are Unsuccessful\nWe do presently and may in the future selectively pursue strategic collaborations or engagements for, among other purposes, development, data collection, analysis, and/or commercialization of our product candidates, domestically or otherwise, such as our arrangements with Restorix, Rohto and Boyalife. For example, we may not be able to commercialize the ALDH technology successfully without entering into an arrangement with a third party to provide an approved method of administration. There can be no assurance as to our ability to utilize the data from such engagements to their potential. Nor can there be any assurance, in general, that we will be able to identify future suitable collaborators or negotiate collaboration agreements on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. In any current or future third-party collaborations, we are and would be dependent upon the success of the collaborators in performing their responsibilities and their continued cooperation and engagement. For a variety of reasons outside of our control, our collaborators or third-party providers may not cooperate with us or perform their obligations under our agreements with them. We cannot control the amount and timing of our collaborators\u2019 resources that will be devoted to performing their responsibilities under our agreements with them. Our collaborators may choose to pursue alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us. The development and commercialization of our product candidates will be delayed if collaborators fail to conduct their responsibilities in a timely manner or in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or if they breach or terminate their collaboration agreements with us. Disputes with our collaborators could also result in product development delays, decreased revenues and litigation expenses.\nThe Success of Our Current and Future Products Is Dependent on Acceptance by the Medical Community\nThe commercial success of our products and processes will depend upon the medical community and patients accepting the therapies as safe and effective. The willingness of the medical community to accept or evaluate our products and processes may be impacted by our ability to cause such information to be included in peer-reviewed literature. We may not have the resources necessary to cause such information to be included in peer-reviewed literature. If the medical community and patients do not ultimately accept the therapies as safe and effective, or we are unable to raise awareness of our products and processes, our ability to sell the products may be materially and adversely affected, and the results of our operations may be adversely effected.\nWe May Be Unable to Attract and Retain Key Personnel\nOur future success depends on the ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled management, including sales representatives. We have retained a team of highly qualified officers and consultants, but may not be able to successfully retain all of them, or be successful in recruiting additional personnel as needed, particularly in light of the fact that we have had several reductions in force over the past years. Our inability to do retain existing or add new personnel will materially and adversely affect the business prospects, operating results and financial condition of the Company. Our ability to maintain and provide additional services to our customers depends upon our ability to hire and retain business development and scientific and technical personnel with the skills necessary to keep pace with continuing changes in regenerative biological therapy technologies. Competition for such personnel is intense; we compete with pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare companies with greater access to resources. Our inability to hire additional qualified personnel may lead to higher recruiting, relocation and compensation costs for such personnel. These increased costs may reduce our profit margins or make hiring new key personnel impractical.\nLegislative and Administrative Action May Have an Adverse Effect on Our Company\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the health care industry in the U.S. to fundamental change. We cannot predict what other legislation relating to our business or to the health care industry may be enacted, including legislation relating to third-party reimbursement, or what effect such legislation may have on our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. We expect federal and state legislators to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery and payment systems, and possibly adopt legislation affecting further changes in the health care delivery system. Such laws may contain provisions that may change the operating environment for hospitals and managed care organizations. Health care industry participants may react to such legislation by curtailing or deferring expenditures and initiatives, including those relating to our products. Future legislation could result in modifications to the existing public and private health care insurance systems that would have a material adverse effect on the reimbursement policies discussed above. With growing pressures on government budgets due to the current economic downturn, government efforts to contain or reduce health care spending are likely to gain increasing emphasis. Several members of the current presidential administration and Congress are espousing support for cost-containment measures that could have significant implications for healthcare therapies, including our current and future products. If enacted and implemented, such measures could result in decreased revenue from our products and decrease potential returns from our research and development initiatives. Furthermore, we may not be able to successfully neutralize any lobbying efforts against any initiatives we may have with governmental agencies.\nWe Could Be Affected by Malpractice or Product Liability Claims\nProviding medical care entails an inherent risk of professional malpractice and other claims. We do not control or direct the practice of medicine by physicians or health care providers who use our products and do not assume responsibility for compliance with regulatory and other requirements directly applicable to physicians. There is no assurance that claims, suits or complaints relating to the use of our products, and treatment administered by physicians, will not be asserted against us in the future. The production, marketing and sale, and use of our products entails risks that product liability claims will be asserted against us. These risks cannot be eliminated, and we could be held liable for any damages that result from adverse reactions or infectious disease transmission. Such liability could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. We currently maintain professional and product liability insurance coverage, but the coverage limits of this insurance may not be adequate to protect against all potential claims. We may not be able to obtain or maintain professional and product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities.\nOur Products Have Existing Competition in the Marketplace\nIn the market for biotechnology products, we face competition from pharmaceutical companies, biopharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, and other competitors. The chronic wound market has many therapies that compete with Aurix that have established habitual use patterns and provider contracts to encourage standardized use. Furthermore, other companies have developed or are developing products that could be in direct future competition with our current product line. Biotechnology development projects are characterized by intense competition. Thus, we may not be the first to the market with any newly developed products and we may not successfully be able to market these products. If we are not able to participate and compete in the regenerative biological therapy market, our financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. We may not be able to compete effectively against such companies in the future. Many of these companies have substantially greater capital resources, larger marketing staffs and more experience in commercializing products than we do. Recently developed technologies, or technologies that may be developed in the future, may be the basis for developments that will compete with our products.\nIf We Determine That Our Intangible Assets Have Become Impaired in the Future, Our Total Assets and Earnings Could Be Adversely Affected.\nGoodwill represents the purchase price of acquisitions in excess of the amounts assigned to acquired tangible or intangible assets and assumed liabilities. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently, if indicators of impairment exist. Finite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If the impairment evaluations for goodwill and intangible assets indicate the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had recorded intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of approximately $2.5 million, primarily as a result of the 2010 acquisition of the Angel product line from Sorin USA. We incurred impairment charges in 2015 and 2014 totaling $30.6 million for IPR&D and trademarks which originally resulted from the February 2012 acquisition of Aldagen. The estimated fair value of our IPR&D was de minimis as of December 31, 2015. The impairment charges resulted from the discontinuation of directly funded clinical development activities at Aldagen and our continuing deteriorating financial condition throughout the second half of 2015 and, as a result, the lack of available independent funding to continue clinical development related to our ALDH Bright Cell technology and a decreasing probability of receiving final product approval within the foreseeable future, if at all.\nIn conjunction with the assignment of the Angel asset to the Deerfield Lenders, our emergence from bankruptcy and the intended application of fresh start accounting as of the Effective Date, the remaining Angel-related intangible assets were written off in the second quarter of 2016. Upon application of fresh start accounting, intangible assets will be fair valued and recognized as of the Effective Date, and may include intangible assets such as trademarks, technology, clinician relationships, and goodwill.\nWe Have Only Limited Experience Manufacturing Our Aldagen Product Candidates. We May Not Be Able to Manufacture Our Aldagen Product Candidates in Compliance With Evolving Regulatory Standards or in Quantities Sufficient for Commercial Sale\nComponents of therapeutic products approved for commercial sale or used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP as required by the FDA. Manufacturers of cell-based product candidates, such as our Aldagen product candidates, also must comply with the FDA\u2019s current good tissue practices, or cGTP. In addition, we may be required to modify our manufacturing process from time-to-time for our product candidates in response to FDA requests if we, in fact, reinitiate cell processing and manufacturing activities in the future. Manufacture of live cellular-based products is complex and subjects us to significant regulatory burdens that may change over time. We may encounter difficulties in the production of our Aldagen product candidates due to our limited manufacturing capabilities. We have only limited manufacturing experience with our Aldagen product candidates, and we currently do not have sufficient manufacturing capacity to support commercialization of any of our Aldagen product candidates. These difficulties could reduce sales of our Aldagen products, if they are approved for marketing, increase our costs or cause production delays, any of which could damage our reputation and hurt our profitability.\nIf we successfully obtain marketing approval for any Aldagen product candidates, we may not be able to efficiently produce sufficient quantities of these products to meet potential commercial demand. We expect that we would need to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities to meet potential demand for these products. Such expansion would require additional regulatory approvals. We may also encounter difficulties in the commercial-scale manufacture of all of our product candidates. We are currently developing new processes and are in discussions with other companies to develop new instruments to improve our manufacturing efficiency. Improving the speed and efficiency of our manufacturing process and the cell sorters and other instruments we use is a key element of our business plan. However, we may not be able to develop process enhancements on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we fail to develop these improvements, we could face significantly higher capital expenditures than we anticipate, increased facility and personnel costs and other increased operating expenses. We may need to demonstrate that our product candidates manufactured using any new processes or instruments are comparable to our product candidates used in clinical trials. Depending on the type and degree of differences, we may be required to conduct additional studies or clinical trials to demonstrate comparability.\nIn addition, some changes in our manufacturing processes or procedures, including a change in the location where a product candidate is manufactured, generally require prior FDA or foreign regulatory authority review and approval for determining our compliance with cGMP and cGTP. We may need to conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials to support approval of any such changes. Furthermore, this review process could be costly and time-consuming and could delay or prevent the commercialization of Aldagen our product candidates.\nIf Our Patent Position Does Not Adequately Protect Our Product Candidates or Any Future Products, Others Could Compete Against Us More Directly, Which Would Harm Our Business\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our product candidates. Issued patents may be challenged by third parties, resulting in patents being deemed invalid, unenforceable or narrowed in scope, or a third party may circumvent any such issued patents. The patent position of biotechnology companies is generally highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has been the subject of much litigation and recent court decisions introducing uncertainty in the strength of patents owned by biotechnology companies. The legal systems of some foreign countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Therefore, any patents that we own or license may not provide sufficient protection against competitors.\nThe claims of the issued patents that are licensed to us, and the claims of any patents which may issue in the future and be owned by or licensed to us, may not confer on us significant commercial protection against competing products. Also, our pending patent applications may not issue, and we may not receive any additional patents. Our patents might not contain claims that are sufficiently broad to prevent others from utilizing our technologies. Consequently, our competitors may independently develop competing products that do not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. To the extent a competitor can develop similar products using a different chemistry, our patents may not prevent others from directly competing with us. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization of our product candidates, thereby reducing any advantages of the patent. For instance, one of our patents relating to our technology will expire in 2019. To the extent our product candidates based on that technology are not commercialized significantly ahead of this date, or to the extent we have no other patent protection on such product candidates, those product candidates would not be protected by patents beyond 2019 and we would then rely solely on other forms of exclusivity, such as regulatory exclusivity provided by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which may provide less protection of our competitive position. Similar considerations apply in any other country where we are prosecuting patents, have been issued patents, or have licensed patents or patent applications relating to our technology. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do laws of the U.S.\nIf We Are Unable to Protect the Confidentiality of Our Proprietary Information and Know-how, Our Competitive Position Would be Impaired\nA significant amount of our technology, especially regarding manufacturing processes, is unpatented and is maintained by us as trade secrets. The background technologies used in the development of our product candidates are known in the scientific community, and it is possible to duplicate the methods we use to create our product candidates. In an effort to protect these trade secrets, we require our employees, consultants and contractors to execute confidentiality agreements with us. These agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. These agreements, however, may not provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information, and these agreements may be breached. Adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. A breach of confidentiality could affect our competitive position. In addition, in some situations, these agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants, collaborators or advisors have previous employment or consulting relationships. Also, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. The disclosure of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position.\nIf We Infringe, or Are Alleged to Infringe, Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties, Our Business Could be Harmed\nOur research, development and commercialization activities, including any product candidates resulting from these activities, may infringe, or be claimed to infringe, patents or other proprietary rights owned by third parties, and to which we do not hold licenses or other rights. There may be patent applications that have been filed but not published that, when issued, could be asserted against us. These third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages.\nFurther, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit. We have not conducted an exhaustive search or analysis of third-party patent rights to determine whether our research, development or commercialization activities, including any product candidates resulting from these activities, may infringe or be alleged to infringe any third-party patent rights. As a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or in order to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be required to seek a license from the third party. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the licensee would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property.\nUltimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. All of the issues described above could also affect our potential collaborators to the extent we have any collaborations then in place, which would also affect the success of the collaboration and therefore us. There has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. In addition to infringement claims against us, we may become a party to other patent litigation and other proceedings, including inter partes review and/or interference proceedings declared by the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office and opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office, regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates and technology.\nAny Product for Which We Obtain Marketing Approval Will Be Subject to Extensive Ongoing Regulatory Requirements, and We May Be Subject to Penalties if We Fail to Comply with Regulatory Requirements or if We Experience Unanticipated Problems with Our Products, When and if Any of Them Are Approved\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration requirements, cGMP and cGTP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements relating to product labeling, advertising and promotion, and recordkeeping. Even if regulatory approval of a product is granted, the approval may be subject to additional limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to other conditions of approval. In addition, approval may contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. Discovery after approval of previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in actions such as:\n\u00b7 restrictions on such products\u2019 manufacturing processes;\n\u00b7 restrictions on the marketing of a product;\n\u00b7 restrictions on product distribution;\n\u00b7 requirements to conduct post-marketing clinical trials;\n\u00b7 warning letters;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u00b7 refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u00b7 recall of products;\n\u00b7 fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n\u00b7 suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u00b7 product seizure;\n\u00b7 injunctions; or\n\u00b7 imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nFailure to Obtain Regulatory Approval in International Jurisdictions Would Prevent Us from Marketing Products Abroad\nWe may in the future seek to market some of our product candidates outside the U.S. In order to market our product candidates in the European Union and many other jurisdictions, we must submit clinical data concerning our product candidates and obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval from foreign regulators may be longer than the time required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the U.S. may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the U.S., it is required that the product candidate be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. In some cases this may include approval of the price we intend to charge for our product, if approved. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the U.S. on a timely basis, or at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the U.S. does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively affect the regulatory process in other countries. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize any products in any market and therefore may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our business.\nRisks Related to the New Common Stock and Warrants\nThere is Currently No Market for Our New Common Stock\nThere is currently no market for our New Common Stock. While we intend to apply to have the shares of New Common Stock approved for trading on OTC Markets Group\u2019s OTCQX or OTCQB marketplace once we have satisfied the necessary conditions for such application, we cannot assure you that our application will be approved. If our application is not approved, we may be forced to have our New Common Stock trade on the \u201cpink sheets,\u201d and the market for resale of our New Common Stock would be extremely limited. In that case, holders of our New Common Stock may find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of, our New Common Stock, and the market value of our New Common Stock may decline as a result.\nEven if Approved for Trading on OTCQX or OTCQB, We Would Trade on an Over-the-Counter Market, Which May Affect the Liquidity of Our New Common Stock\nOver-the-counter markets are generally considered to be less efficient than, and not as broad as, a stock exchange. Even if approved for trading on OTC Markets, there would be a limited market for our New Common Stock, and trading in our stock may become difficult and our share price could decrease as a result of this limited liquidity or otherwise. Specifically, stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of New Common Stock at or above the price paid for such shares, or at or above the price implied by the ratio at which Old Common Stock were exchanged for New Common Stock under the Plan of Reorganization. In addition, our ability to raise additional capital may be impaired because of the less liquid nature of the over-the-counter markets. We may not be able to complete an equity financing on acceptable terms, or at all. In that context, investors should consider that the New Common Stock will not be listed on a national securities exchange, which makes us ineligible to use shorter and less costly filings, such as Form S-3, to register our securities for sale. While we may use Form S-1 to register a sale of our stock to raise capital or complete acquisitions, doing so would likely increase transaction costs and adversely impact our ability to raise capital or complete acquisitions of other companies in a timely manner.\nIf we are able to complete equity financings, the dilution from any equity financing while our shares are quoted on an over-the-counter market could be greater than if we were to complete a financing while our New Common Stock were listed on a national securities exchange.\nThe average daily trading volume in our Old Common Stock was relatively low. If low trading volume also persists with respect to our New Common Stock (if and when it commences trading), it could be difficult to sell a significant number of shares of New Common Stock at any particular time at the market prices prevailing immediately before such shares are offered. Stockholders may be required to hold shares of New Common Stock for an indefinite period of time. In addition, sales of substantial amounts of New Common Stock could lower the prevailing market price of our New Common Stock. Finally, in recent years the stock market in general, and the market for life sciences companies in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies, often for reasons unrelated to their operating performance, and it may adversely affect the price of our New Common Stock. These broad market fluctuations may reduce the demand for our stock and therefore adversely affect the price of our securities, regardless of operating performance. See also \u201c- U.S. Broker-Dealers May Be Discouraged from Effecting Transactions in Shares of our New Common Stock.\u201d\nThe Value of our New Common Stock Is Affected by the Liquidation Preference and Other Terms of our Series A Preferred Stock\nOn the Effective Date, the Company filed a Certificate of Designations with the Delaware Secretary of State, designating 29,038 shares of the Company\u2019s undesignated preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, as Series A Preferred Stock. On the Effective Date, the Company issued 29,038 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to the Deerfield Lenders in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization. The Series A Preferred Stock has no stated maturity date, is not convertible or redeemable and carries a liquidation preference of $29,038,000, which is required to be paid to holders of such Series A Preferred Stock before any payments are made with respect to shares of New Common Stock (and other capital stock that is not issued on parity or senior to the Series A Preferred Stock) upon a liquidation or change in control transaction.\nU.S. Broker-Dealers May Be Discouraged from Effecting Transactions in Shares of our New Common Stock\nThe SEC has adopted a number of rules to regulate \u201cpenny stock\u201d that restricts transactions involving our shares of New Common Stock. Such rules include Rules 3a51-1, 15g-1, 15g-2, 15g-3, 15g-4, 15g-5, 15g-6, 15g-7, and 15g-9 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These rules may have the effect of reducing the liquidity of penny stocks. \u201cPenny stocks\u201d generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exclusions. Our shares of New Common Stock constitute \u201cpenny stock\u201d within the meaning of the rules. The additional sales practice and disclosure requirements imposed upon U.S. broker-dealers in connection with effecting transactions in \u201cpenny stocks\u201d may discourage such broker-dealers from effecting transactions in shares of our New Common Stock, which could severely limit the market liquidity of such shares and impede their sale in the secondary market.\nA U.S. broker-dealer selling penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or \u201caccredited investor\u201d (generally, an individual with net worth, excluding the value of the primary residence, in excess of $1,000,000 or an annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with his or her spouse) must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must receive the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. In addition, the penny stock regulations require the U.S. broker-dealer to deliver, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared in accordance with SEC standards relating to the penny stock market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. A U.S. broker-dealer is also required to disclose commissions payable to the U.S. broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, a U.S. broker-dealer is required to submit monthly statements disclosing recent price information with respect to the penny stock held in a customer\u2019s account and information with respect to the limited market in penny stocks.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our New Common Stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.\nFurthermore, transfers of our New Common Stock may require broker-dealers to submit notice filings and pay fees in certain states, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our New Common Stock.\nYou should also be aware that, according to the SEC, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (i) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (ii) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (iii) \u201cboiler room\u201d practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (iv) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (v) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, resulting in investor losses.\nOur Officers, Directors and Principal Stockholders Can Exert Significant Influence Over Us and May Make Decisions That Are Not in the Best Interests of All Stockholders\nAs of September 30, 2016, our officers and directors beneficially owned approximately 25.2% of our shares of New Common Stock, while principal stockholders Charles E. Sheedy and Boyalife Investment Fund I, Inc. together beneficially owned an additional approximately 76.5% of our shares of New Common Stock. For these purposes, beneficial ownership was calculated to include all shares of New Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of options or warrants exercisable as of the date above, or exercisable within 60 days after such date. In addition, for so long as Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to nominate and elect one member of our Board of Directors and to have such director serve on a standing committee of the Board of Directors established to exercise powers of the Board of Directors in respect of decisions or actions relating to the Backstop Commitment. The Series A Preferred Stock have voting rights, voting with the New Common Stock as a single class, representing approximately one percent (1%) of the voting rights of the capital stock of the Company, and the holders of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to approve certain transactions and incurrences of debt.\nAs a result, our officers, directors, principal holders of New Common Stock and holders of Series A Preferred Stock are able to affect the outcome of, or exert significant influence over, all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any change in control. This concentration of ownership of our New Common Stock and our Series A Preferred Stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us or otherwise discouraging or preventing a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us. This, in turn, could have a negative effect on the market price of our New Common Stock, if and when it commences trading. It could also prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market prices for their shares of New Common Stock. Moreover, the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders, and accordingly, they could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that we would not otherwise consider.\nTransactions Engaged in by Our Largest Stockholders, Our Directors or Officers Involving Our New Common Stock May Have an Adverse Effect on the Price of Our Stock\nThe risks described in this Risk Factor assume that our New Common Stock commences trading. Sales of our New Common Stock by our officers, directors and principal stockholders could have the effect of lowering our stock price. In connection with the Recapitalization Transaction, we agreed to file a registration statement covering the resale of securities issued in that transaction. The perceived risk associated with the possible sale of a large number of shares of New Common Stock by those stockholders could cause some of our stockholders to sell their stock, thus causing the price of our New Common Stock to decline. In addition, actual or anticipated downward pressure on our stock price due to actual or anticipated sales of New Common Stock by our directors or officers could cause other institutions or individuals to engage in short sales of our New Common Stock, which may further cause the price of our stock to decline.\nFrom time to time our directors and executive officers may sell shares of our New Common Stock on the open market. These sales will be publicly disclosed in filings made with the SEC. In the future, our directors and executive officers may sell a significant number of shares for a variety of reasons unrelated to the performance of our business. Our stockholders may perceive these sales as a reflection on management\u2019s view of the business, which may result in some stockholders selling their shares of our New Common Stock. These sales could cause the price of our stock to drop.\nVolatility of Our Stock Price Could Adversely Affect Current and Future Stockholders\nIf and when shares of our New Common Stock commence trading, the market price of our New Common Stock is likely to fluctuate widely in response to various factors which are beyond our control. The price of our New Common Stock is not necessarily indicative of our operating performance or long-term business prospects. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our New Common Stock. Factors that could cause the market price to fluctuate substantially include, among others:\n\u00b7 our ability or inability to execute our business plan;\n\u00b7 the dilutive effect or perceived dilutive effect of additional equity financings;\n\u00b7 investor perception of our company and of the industry;\n\u00b7 the success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments in the U.S. or overseas;\n\u00b7 developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 the recruitment or departure of key personnel; or\n\u00b7 general economic, political and market conditions.\nThe stock market in general has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Continued market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of our New Common Stock, which could cause a decline in the value of our New Common Stock. Price volatility could be worse if the trading volume of our New Common Stock is low (assuming that our New Common Stock in fact begins trading).\nDrawdowns Under the Backstop Commitment, or the Exercise of the Warrants or Options, May Cause Substantial Dilution to Our Existing Stockholders\nIn connection with the Recapitalization Transaction, a significant majority of the Recapitalization Investors executed backstop commitments to purchase up to 12,800,000 additional shares of New Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of up to $3,000,000 (collectively, the \u201cBackstop Commitment\u201d). For so long as the Backstop Commitment remains in effect, a majority of the members of the standing backstop committee of the Board of Directors may approve a drawdown under the Backstop Commitment. Any such drawdown may cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.\nIn the Recapitalization Transaction, we issued Warrants to purchase 6,180,000 shares of New Common Stock to certain of the Recapitalization Investors. The Warrants terminate on May 5, 2021 and are exercisable at any time on or after November 5, 2016 at exercise prices ranging from $0.50 per share to $1.00 per share. The exercise of these Warrants may cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.\nIn addition, our Board of Directors has granted options to purchase 1,362,500 shares of New Common Stock to certain of our employees and directors, subject to approval of the 2016 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended and restated, by our stockholders, of which 105,000 options have been forfeited since their grant date. The exercise of these options may also cause dilution to our existing stockholders and affect the market price of the New Common Stock.\nWe May Likely Issue Additional Equity or Debt Securities Which May Materially and Adversely Affect the Price of Our New Common Stock\nSales of substantial amounts of shares of our New Common Stock in the public market if and when trading commences, or the perception that those sales may occur, could negatively affect the market price of our New Common Stock. We have used, and will likely continue to use, our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock to fund working capital needs or to acquire technology, product rights or businesses, or for other purposes. If additional equity and/or equity-linked securities are issued, particularly during times when our New Common Stock is trading at relatively low price levels, the price of our New Common Stock may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are Subject to Anti-Takeover Provisions and Laws\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws and applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting common stock or delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer or proxy contest, which may negatively affect the price of our New Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 90750, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "NUOTQ"}
