{"cik": "350852", "company": "COMMUNITY TRUST BANCORP INC /KY/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent to our business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference herein. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. See also, \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d If any of the following risks actually occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nEconomic Environment Risks\nEconomic Risk\nCTBI may continue to be adversely affected by economic and market conditions.\nOur financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where we operate, in the states of Kentucky, West Virginia, and Tennessee and in the United States as a whole. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity, or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment; natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors. Currently, the pandemic known as COVID-19 is causing worldwide concern and economic disruption. Economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding economic improvement may result in continued changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing, and savings habits. Such conditions could adversely affect the credit quality of our loans and our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEconomy of Our Markets\nOur business may continue to be adversely affected by ongoing weaknesses in the local economies on which we depend.\nOur loan portfolio is concentrated primarily in eastern, northeastern, central, and south central Kentucky, southern West Virginia, and northeastern Tennessee. Our profits depend on providing products and services to clients in these local regions. Unemployment rates in our markets remain high compared to the national average. Increases in unemployment, decreases in real estate values, or increases in interest rates could weaken the local economies in which we operate. These economic indicators typically affect certain industries, such as real estate and financial services, more significantly. High levels of unemployment and depressed real estate asset values in certain of the markets we serve would likely prolong the economic recovery period in our market area. Also, our growth within certain of our markets may be adversely affected by inconsistent access to high speed internet, and the lack of population and business growth in such markets in recent years. Weakness in our market area could depress our earnings and consequently our financial condition because:\n\u2022 Clients may not want, need, or qualify for our products and services;\n\u2022 Borrowers may not be able to repay their loans;\n\u2022 The value of the collateral securing our loans to borrowers may decline; and\n\u2022 The quality of our loan portfolio may decline.\nMany states and municipalities are experiencing financial stress. As a result, various levels of government have sought to increase their tax revenues through increased tax levies, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nClimate Change Risk\nOur business may be adversely impacted by climate change and related initiatives.\nClimate change and other emissions-related laws, regulations, and agreements have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the international, federal, state, and local levels. These final and proposed initiatives take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions. Our markets include areas where the coal industry was historically a significant part of the local economy. The importance of the coal industry to such areas has, however, continued to decline substantially and the economies of our markets have become more diversified. Nevertheless, to the extent that existing or new climate change laws, regulations, or agreements further impact production, purchase, or use of coal, the economies of certain areas within our markets, the demand for financing, the value of collateral securing our coal-related loans, and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe, like all businesses, as well as our market areas, borrowers, and customers, may be adversely impacted to the extent that weather-related events cause damage or disruption to properties or businesses.\nOperational Risks\nInterest Rate Risk\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nOur earnings and financial condition are dependent to a large degree upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned from loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The narrowing of interest-rate spreads, meaning the difference between the interest rates earned on loans and investments and the interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings, could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including:\n\u2022 The rate of inflation;\n\u2022 The rate of economic growth;\n\u2022 Employment levels;\n\u2022 Monetary policies; and\n\u2022 Instability in domestic and foreign financial markets.\nChanges in market interest rates will also affect the level of voluntary prepayments on our loans and the receipt of payments on our mortgage-backed securities resulting in the receipt of proceeds that may be reinvested at a lower rate than the loan or mortgage-backed security being prepaid.\nWe originate residential loans for sale and for our portfolio. The origination of loans for sale is designed to meet client financing needs and earn fee income. The origination of loans for sale is highly dependent upon the local real estate market and the level and trend of interest rates. Increasing interest rates may reduce the origination of loans for sale and consequently the fee income we earn. While our commercial banking, construction, and income property business lines remain a significant portion of our activities, high interest rates may reduce our mortgage-banking activities and thereby our income. In contrast, decreasing interest rates have the effect of causing clients to refinance mortgage loans faster than anticipated. This causes the value of assets related to the servicing rights on loans sold to be lower than originally anticipated. If this happens, we may need to write down our servicing assets faster, which would accelerate our expense and lower our earnings.\nWe consider interest rate risk one of our most significant market risks. Interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates. Consistency of our net interest revenue is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk. We employ a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage our interest rate risk including the use of an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to changing interest rates. The model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for on and off-balance sheet instruments and incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain financial assets and liabilities. Assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model. These assumptions are inherently uncertain, and as a result, the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies.\nFinancial institutions, including CTBI, must transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate.\nLIBOR will cease to exist as a published rate after 2021. The Federal Reserve through the Alternative Reference Rate Committee has recommended a replacement benchmark rate, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. All loans extending beyond 2021 will need to be managed to ensure appropriate benchmark rate replacements are provided for and adopted. Failure to identify and negotiate a replacement benchmark rate and/or update data processing systems could result in future interest rate risk not being mitigated as intended or interest being miscalculated, which could adversely impact CTBI\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2020, CTBI had approximately $27.8 million in variable rate loans and $113.6 million in available-for-sale securities with interest rates tied to LIBOR, substantially all of which have maturity dates beyond December 31, 2021. In addition, CTBI has debentures outstanding in the principal amount of $57.8 million which mature in 2037 and bear interest at a rate tied to LIBOR.\nMoreover, financial institution contracts linked to LIBOR are widespread and intertwined with numerous financial products and services. The downstream effect of unwinding or transitioning such contracts could cause instability and negatively impact financial markets and individual institutions. The uncertainty surrounding the transition from LIBOR could adversely affect the U.S. financial system more broadly.\nCredit Risk\nOur earnings and reputation may be adversely affected if we fail to effectively manage our credit risk.\nOriginating and underwriting loans are integral to the success of our business. This business requires us to take \u201ccredit risk,\u201d which is the risk of losing principal and interest income because borrowers fail to repay loans. Collateral values and the ability of borrowers to repay their loans may be affected at any time by factors such as:\n\u2022 The length and severity of downturns in the local economies in which we operate or the national economy;\n\u2022 The length and severity of downturns in one or more of the business sectors in which our customers operate, particularly the automobile, hotel/motel, coal, and residential development industries; or\n\u2022 A rapid increase in interest rates.\nOur loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss.\nWe originate commercial real estate residential loans, commercial real estate nonresidential loans, hotel/motel loans, other commercial loans, consumer loans, and residential mortgage loans, primarily within our market area. Commercial real estate residential, commercial real estate nonresidential, hotel/motel, and other commercial loans tend to involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers and are most susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle. These loans also have historically had a greater credit risk than other loans for the following reasons:\n\u2022 Commercial Real Estate Residential. Repayment is dependent on income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. As of December 31, 2020, commercial real estate residential loans comprised approximately 8% of our total loan portfolio.\n\u2022 Commercial Real Estate Nonresidential. Repayment is dependent on income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. As of December 31, 2020, commercial real estate nonresidential loans comprised approximately 21% of our total loan portfolio.\n\u2022 Hotel/Motel. The hotel and motel industry is highly susceptible to changes in the domestic and global economic environments, which has caused the industry to experience substantial volatility due to the recent global pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, hotel/motel loans comprised approximately 7% of our total loan portfolio.\n\u2022 Other Commercial Loans. Repayment is generally dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower\u2019s business. In addition, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, be difficult to appraise, be illiquid, or fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. As of December 31, 2020, other commercial loans comprised approximately 17% of our total loan portfolio. SBA Paycheck Protection Program loans, as discussed below in the COVID-19 Risks section, comprise approximately 42% of the other commercial loan portfolio and 7% of the total loan portfolio.\nConsumer loans may carry a higher degree of repayment risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly when the consumer loan is unsecured. Repayment of a consumer loan typically depends on the borrower\u2019s financial stability, and it is more likely to be affected adversely by job loss, illness, or personal bankruptcy. In addition, federal and state bankruptcy, insolvency, and other laws may limit the amount we can recover when a consumer client defaults. As of December 31, 2020, consumer loans comprised approximately 22% of our total loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 80% of our consumer loans and 17% of our total loan portfolio were consumer indirect loans. Consumer indirect loans are fixed rate loans secured by new and used automobiles, trucks, vans, and recreational vehicles originated at selling dealerships which are purchased by us following our review and approval of such loans. These loans generally have a greater risk of loss in the event of default than, for example, one-to-four family residential mortgage loans due to the rapid depreciation of vehicles securing the loans. We face the risk that the collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. We also assume the risk that the dealership administering the lending process complies with applicable consumer protection law and regulations.\nA significant part of our lending business is focused on small to medium-sized business which may be impacted more severely during periods of economic weakness.\nA significant portion of our commercial loan portfolio is tied to small to medium-sized businesses in our markets. During periods of economic weakness, small to medium-sized businesses may be impacted more severely than larger businesses. As a result, the ability of smaller businesses to repay their loans may deteriorate, particularly if economic challenges persist over a period of time, and such deterioration would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nA large percentage of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, in particular commercial real estate. Weakness in the real estate market or other segments of our loan portfolio would lead to additional losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 54% of our loan portfolio was secured by real estate, 29% of which is commercial real estate. High levels of commercial and consumer delinquencies or declines in real estate market values could require increased net charge-offs and increases in the allowance for credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.\nCompetition\nStrong competition within our market area may reduce our ability to attract and retain deposits and originate loans.\nWe face competition both in originating loans and in attracting deposits. Competition in the financial services industry is intense. We compete for clients by offering excellent service and competitive rates on our loans and deposit products. The type of institutions we compete with include commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies and brokerage and investment banking firms. Competition arises from institutions located within and outside our market areas. As financial services become increasingly dependent on technology, permitting transactions to be conducted by telephone, mobile banking, and the internet, non-bank institutions are able to attract funds and provide lending and other financial services without offices located in our market areas. As a result of their size and ability to achieve economies of scale, certain of our competitors offer a broader range of products and services than we offer. With the increased consolidation in the financial industry, larger financial institutions may strengthen their competitive positions. In addition, to stay competitive in our markets we may need to adjust the interest rates on our products to match the rates offered by our competitors, which could adversely affect our net interest margin. As a result, our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market areas while achieving our investment objectives.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing consumers to complete financial transactions through alternative methods to those which historically involved banks. For example, consumers can now hold funds that would have been held as bank deposits in mutual funds, brokerage accounts, general purpose reloadable prepaid cards, or cyber currency. In addition, consumers can complete transactions, such as paying bills or transferring funds, directly without utilizing the services of a bank. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries (known as disintermediation), could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of deposits and the income that might be generated from those deposits. The related revenue reduction could adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nOperational Risk\nAn extended disruption of vital infrastructure or a security breach could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur operations depend upon, among other things, our infrastructure, including equipment and facilities. Extended disruption of vital infrastructure by fire, power loss, natural disaster, telecommunications failure, computer hacking or viruses, terrorist activity or the domestic and foreign response to such activity, or other events outside of our control could have a material adverse impact on the financial services industry as a whole and on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition in particular. Our business recovery plan may not work as intended or may not prevent significant interruption of our operations. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in the loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nOur information technology systems and networks may experience interruptions, delays, or cessations of service or produce errors due to regular maintenance efforts, such as systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming, disruptive, and resource intensive. Such disruptions could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nThird party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure, such as processing, internet connections, and network access. While CTBI has selected these third party vendors carefully through its vendor management process, it does not control their actions and generally is not able to obtain satisfactory indemnification provisions in its third party vendor written contracts. Any problems caused by third parties or arising from their services, such as disruption in service, negligence in the performance of services or a breach of customer data security with regard to the third parties\u2019 systems, could adversely affect our ability to deliver services, negatively impact our business reputation, cause a loss of customers, or result in increased expenses, regulatory fines and sanctions, or litigation.\nClaims and litigation may arise pertaining to fiduciary responsibility.\nCustomers may, from time to time, make a claim and take legal action pertaining to our performance of fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to our performance of fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, they may result in significant financial liability, adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services, and impact customer demand for those products and services. Any such financial liability or reputational damage could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSignificant legal actions could subject us to uninsured liabilities.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to claims related to our operations. These claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by our regulators, could involve significant amounts. We maintain insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles we believe are appropriate for our operations. However, our insurance coverage may not cover all claims against us and related costs, and further insurance coverage may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost. As a result, CTBI could be exposed to uninsured liabilities, which could adversely affect CTBI\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nTechnology Risk\nCTBI continually encounters technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nCyber Risk\nA breach in the security of our systems could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, and create significant financial and legal exposure for us.\nOur businesses are dependent on our ability and the ability of our third party service providers to process, record, and monitor a large number of transactions. If the financial, accounting, data processing, or other operating systems and facilities fail to operate properly, become disabled, experience security breaches, or have other significant shortcomings, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nAlthough we and our third party service providers devote significant resources to maintain and upgrade our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of computer systems, software, networks, and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information belonging to us and our customers, there is no assurance that our security systems and those of our third party service providers will provide absolute security. Financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks, and other means. Despite our efforts and those of our third party service providers to ensure the integrity of these systems, it is possible that we or our third party service providers may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources.\nA successful breach of the security of our systems or those of our third party service providers could cause serious negative consequences to us, including significant disruption of our operations, misappropriation of our confidential information or the confidential information of our customers, or damage to our computers or operating systems, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss in confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. While we maintain insurance coverage that should, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of our cyber risks, this insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses we could experience resulting from a cyber-security breach. Moreover, the cost of insurance sufficient to cover substantially all, or a reasonable portion, of losses related to cyber security breaches is expected to increase and such increases are likely to be material.\nBanking customers and employees have been, and will likely continue to be, targeted by parties using fraudulent e-mails and other communications in attempts to misappropriate passwords, account information, or other personal information, or to introduce viruses or other malware to bank information systems or customers\u2019 computers. Though we endeavor to lessen the success of such threats through the use of authentication technology and employee education, such cyber-attacks remain a serious issue. Publicity concerning security and cyber-related problems could inhibit the use or growth of electronic or web-based applications as a means of conducting banking and other commercial transactions.\nWe could incur increased costs or reductions in revenue or suffer reputational damage in the event of misuse of information.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks regarding our customers and their accounts. To provide these products and services, we use information systems and infrastructure that we and third party service providers operate. As a financial institution, we also are subject to and examined for compliance with an array of data protection laws, regulations, and guidance, as well as to our own internal privacy and information security policies and programs.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions like us have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, and other external parties. Our technologies and systems may become the target of cyber-attacks or other attacks that could result in the misuse or destruction of our or our customers\u2019 confidential, proprietary, or other information or that could result in disruptions to the business operations of us or our customers or other third parties. Also, our customers, in order to access some of our products and services, may use personal computers, smart mobile phones, tablet PCs, and other devices that are beyond our controls and security systems. Further, a breach or attack affecting one of our third-party service providers or partners could impact us through no fault of our own. In addition, because the methods and techniques employed by perpetrators of fraud and others to attack systems and applications change frequently and often are not fully recognized or understood until after they have been launched, we and our third-party service providers and partners may be unable to anticipate certain attack methods in order to implement effective preventative measures.\nWhile we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible security breach of our information systems, if unauthorized persons were somehow to get access to confidential or proprietary information in our possession or to our proprietary information, it could result in litigation and regulatory investigations, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems that could materially adversely affect our results of operation.\nCounterparty Risk\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect CTBI.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional counterparties. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, or results of operations.\nAcquisition Risks\nAcquisition Risk\nWe may have difficulty in the future continuing to grow through acquisitions.\nWe may experience difficulty in making acquisitions on acceptable terms due to the decreasing number of suitable acquisition targets, competition for attractive acquisitions, regulatory impediments, and certain limitations on interstate acquisitions.\nAny future acquisitions or mergers by CTBI or its banking subsidiary are subject to approval by the appropriate federal and state banking regulators. The banking regulators evaluate a number of criteria in making their approval decisions, such as:\n\u2022 Safety and soundness guidelines;\n\u2022 Compliance with all laws including the USA Patriot Act, the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations promulgated under such Act or the Exchange Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and all other applicable fair lending and consumer protection laws and other laws relating to discriminatory business practices; and\n\u2022 Anti-competitive concerns with the proposed transaction.\nIf the banking regulators or a commenter on our regulatory application raise concerns about any of these criteria at the time a regulatory application is filed, the banking regulators may deny, delay, or condition their approval of a proposed transaction. We have grown, and, subject to regulatory approval, intend to continue to grow, through acquisitions of banks and other financial institutions. After these acquisitions, we may experience adverse changes in results of operations of acquired entities, unforeseen liabilities, asset quality problems of acquired entities, loss of key personnel, loss of clients because of change of identity, difficulties in integrating data processing and operational procedures, and deterioration in local economic conditions. These various acquisition risks can be heightened in larger transactions.\nIntegration Risk\nWe may not be able to achieve the expected integration and cost savings from our bank acquisition activities.\nWe have a long history of acquiring financial institutions and, subject to regulatory approval, we expect this acquisition activity to resume in the future. Difficulties may arise in the integration of the business and operations of the financial institutions that agree to merge with and into CTBI and, as a result, we may not be able to achieve the cost savings and synergies that we expect will result from the merger activities. Achieving cost savings is dependent on consolidating certain operational and functional areas, eliminating duplicative positions and terminating certain agreements for outside services. Additional operational savings are dependent upon the integration of the banking businesses of the acquired financial institution with that of CTBI, including the conversion of the acquired entity\u2019s core operating systems, data systems and products to those of CTBI and the standardization of business practices. Complications or difficulties in the conversion of the core operating systems, data systems, and products of these other banks to those of CTBI may result in the loss of clients, damage to our reputation within the financial services industry, operational problems, one-time costs currently not anticipated by us, and/or reduced cost savings resulting from the merger activities.\nMarket and Liquidity Risks\nMarket Risk\nCommunity Trust Bancorp, Inc.\u2019s stock price is volatile.\nOur stock price has been volatile in the past, and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These factors include:\n\u2022 Actual or anticipated variations in earnings;\n\u2022 Changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections;\n\u2022 CTBI\u2019s announcements of developments related to our businesses;\n\u2022 Operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers;\n\u2022 New technology used or services offered by traditional and non-traditional competitors;\n\u2022 News reports of trends, concerns, and other issues related to the financial services industry; and\n\u2022 Additional governmental policies and enforcement of current laws.\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to CTBI\u2019s performance. Although investor confidence in financial institutions has strengthened, the financial crisis adversely impacted investor confidence in the financial institutions sector. General market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices.\nLiquidity Risk\nCTBI is subject to liquidity risk.\nCTBI requires liquidity to meet its deposit and debt obligations as they come due and to fund loan demands. CTBI\u2019s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance its activities or on terms that are acceptable to it could be impaired by factors that affect it specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could reduce its access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the market, difficult credit markets, or adverse regulatory actions against CTBI. CTBI\u2019s access to deposits may also be affected by the liquidity needs of its depositors. In particular, a substantial majority of CTBI\u2019s liabilities are demand, savings, interest checking, and money market deposits, which are payable on demand or upon several days\u2019 notice, while by comparison, a substantial portion of its assets are loans, which cannot be called or sold in the same time frame. To the extent that consumer confidence in other investment vehicles, such as the stock market, increases, customers may move funds from bank deposits and products into such other investment vehicles. Although CTBI historically has been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary, it might not be able to replace such funds in the future, especially if a large number of its depositors sought to withdraw their accounts, regardless of the reason. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal, Legislation, and Regulation Risks\nRisks Related to Regulatory Policies and Oversight\nThe banking industry is heavily regulated, and our business may be adversely affected by legislation or changes in regulatory policies and oversight.\nThe earnings of banks and bank holding companies such as ours are affected by the policies of regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates the money supply. Among the methods employed by the Federal Reserve Board are open market operations in U.S. Government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These methods are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial and savings banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future.\nIn recent years, federal banking regulators have increased regulatory scrutiny, and additional limitations on financial institutions have been proposed or adopted by regulators and by Congress. Moreover, banking regulatory agencies have increasingly over the last few years used authority under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to take supervisory or enforcement action with respect to alleged unfair or deceptive acts or practices by banks to address practices that may not necessarily fall within the scope of a specific banking or consumer finance law. The banking industry is highly regulated and changes in federal and state banking regulations as well as policies and administration guidelines may affect our practices, growth prospects, and earnings. In particular, there is no assurance that governmental actions designed to stabilize the economy and banking system will not adversely affect the financial position or results of operations of CTBI.\nFrom time to time, CTBI and/or its subsidiaries may be involved in information requests, reviews, investigations, and proceedings (both formal and informal) by various governmental agencies and law enforcement authorities regarding our respective businesses. Any of these matters may result in material adverse consequences to CTBI and its subsidiaries, including adverse judgements, findings, limitations on merger and acquisition activity, settlements, fines, penalties, orders, injunctions, and other actions. Such adverse consequences may be material to the financial position of CTBI or its results of operations.\nIn particular, consumer products and services are subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to compliance with consumer laws and regulations. We may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations, enforcement actions, and litigation in the future related to consumer practices. In addition, any required changes to our business operations resulting from these developments could result in a significant loss of revenue, require remuneration to customers, trigger fines or penalties, limit the products or services we offer, require us to increase certain prices and therefore reduce demand for our products, impose additional compliance costs on us, cause harm to our reputation, or otherwise adversely affect our consumer business.\nThe financial services industry has experienced leadership changes at federal banking agencies, which may impact regulations and government policy applicable to us. New appointments to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve could affect monetary policy and interest rates.\nWe are required to maintain certain minimum amounts and types of capital and may be subject to more stringent capital requirements in the future. A failure to meet applicable capital requirements could have an adverse material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital that we must maintain. From time to time, banking regulators change these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. See Item 1 above for additional information regarding current capital requirements. A failure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental Liability Risk\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activity.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCOVID-19-Related Risks\nCOVID-19 Risk\nSince March 13, 2020, the United States has been operating under a state of emergency in response to the spread of COVID-19. COVID-19 and related governmental responses have affected economic and financial market conditions as well as the operations, results, and prospects of companies across many industries.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has caused increased volatility in financial markets and the possibility of prolonged adverse economic conditions. These changes in economic and financial market conditions could result in decreases in demand for products, decreases in market value of loans and securities, impairments of intangible assets (such as goodwill), decreases in income due to interest rate declines, and increases in customer delinquencies and defaults. There is uncertainty around the duration and breadth of the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result the ultimate impact on our business, financial condition or operating results cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. While we expect the impacts of COVID-19 to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, we are unable to predict the extent or nature of these impacts at this time.\nLoan and Credit Losses. To combat the spread of COVID-19, and, in some cases, in response to governmental mandates to close non-essential businesses, many businesses have ceased or substantially reduced operations for an indeterminate period. In addition, individuals may have been laid off, furloughed, or be unable to work as a result of reduced business operations. These situations could lead to a material change in the credit quality of our loan portfolio.\nIndustry Concentration. Certain industries have been or are likely to be more impacted by COVID-19 than others. The impact to the agriculture industry, bank holding companies, the hotel/motel industry, lessors of non-residential buildings, and lessors of residential buildings/dwellings could lead to significant deterioration in our asset quality.\nSmall and Mid-Size Business Concentration. It is expected that small and mid-size businesses, many of which rely on continuing cash flow to fund day-to-day operations, may be particularly hard hit by forced closures and other preventative measures taken by federal, state, or local governments. Although government programs have sought, and may further seek, to provide relief to these types of entities, there can be no assurance that these programs will succeed. Also, governments may continue to adopt regulations or promulgate executive orders that restrict or limit banks\u2019 ability to take certain actions with these customers that they would otherwise take in the ordinary course-such as following standard collection and foreclosure procedures. At the same time, it may be the case that more customers are expected to draw on existing lines of credit or seek additional loans to help finance their business operations.\nCapital and Liquidity. Market volatility and prolonged periods of economic stress may affect our capital and liquidity. In addition, these factors may limit access to capital markets. Risks to credit portfolios and/or increased draws on outstanding lines of credit could affect capital and liquidity at, and/or result in decreased income or increased losses for, our bank subsidiary. Changes to our capital and liquidity could lead to the need to cease or reduce dividend payments and any formal or informal actions regulators may take to address capital and liquidity concerns.\nSuspension of Mortgage and Other Loan Payments and Foreclosures. The federal government signed into law on March 27, 2020 Title IV of the CARES Act, which provides that individuals with single-family, federally backed mortgages may request a 180-day mortgage forbearance (which can be extended another 180 days) due to COVID-19-related difficulties. It is possible that other states or federal regulators take similar measures. The bank implemented relief actions for our customers including suspension of residential foreclosure actions initially through May 18, 2020 and extended through March 31, 2021 as well as several loan assistance programs designed to assist those customers who are experiencing, or, are likely to experience, financial difficulties directly related to COVID-19 causing loss of individual income and/or household income. Through December 31, 2020, we have processed 3,844 COVID-19 loan deferrals totaling $992 million.\nReal Estate Market and Real Estate Lending. In addition to the actions described above, there is risk that COVID-19 significantly affects the U.S. commercial and residential real estate markets and, accordingly, our real estate lending business in other ways, including through low U.S. mortgage rates (which reached an all-time low during the first quarter), decreasing property values (which, among other effects, may both increase the risk of defaults and reduce the value of real estate collateral, thereby diminishing recovery in the event of default), and reduced demand for commercial and multifamily real estate and increased vacancies if businesses fail or close locations.\nCatastrophes, including Pandemics and Contagious Illnesses. The length of the COVID-19 outbreak is unknown and unpredictable and there is a potential for additional waves of COVID-19 or new strains of coronavirus even after COVID-19 appears contained in an area.\nCybersecurity. We face increased cybersecurity risks due to employees working remotely. Increased levels of remote access create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities, and employees may be more susceptible to phishing and social engineering attempts due to increased stress caused by the crisis and from balancing family and work responsibilities at home. Cybercriminals may also prey on fears about COVID-19, and take advantage of the current environment in which legitimate information regarding COVID-19 is being frequently and widely disseminated, such as by including malware in emails that appear to include documents providing legitimate information for protecting oneself from COVID-19. In addition, technological resources may be strained due to the number of remote users.\nChanges in Consumer Behavior. Consumers affected by COVID-19 may continue to demonstrate changed behavior even after the crisis is over. For example, consumers may decrease discretionary spending on a permanent or long-term basis, certain industries may take longer to recover (particularly those that rely on travel or large gatherings) as consumers may be hesitant to return to full social interaction, and temporary closures of bank branches could result in consumers becoming more comfortable with technology and devaluing face-to-face interaction.\nReliance on Vendors and Other Companies. We rely on vendors and other third parties to provide critical systems and services. COVID-19 presents heightened or novel risks with respect to continuity of critical services. These risks include the possibility of closure or business interruption. In addition, although in most regions subject to a stay-at-home order the definition of essential services generally includes businesses that provide essential services to banks, the definitions vary by state and may result in some vendors not being able to work from their offices.\nChanges to Interest Rates. In response to COVID-19, the Federal Reserve reduced the Federal Funds Rate to zero percent in March 2020. The outlook for 2021 is uncertain, and there is a possibility that the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates low or even uses negative interest rates if economic conditions warrant. The possibility of an extended period of operations in a zero- or negative-rate environment has the potential for significantly decreased profitability.\nOther Impacts on Financial Condition. A prolonged pandemic event may have a number of effects on our financial condition. Decreases in our stock price and cash flow projections as a result of COVID-19 could result in goodwill impairment. In addition, a period of prolonged losses or decreased earnings could result in the expiration of deferred tax assets (\u201cDTA\u201d) before we have the opportunity to use some or all of the benefit of the DTA. Changes in our assessment of whether the full benefit of DTAs may be realized could impact our regulatory capital. We may also be at risk of being required to recognize other-than-temporary impairments and/or reduce other comprehensive income.\nImpact to Investment Management Business Lines. Volatile market conditions caused by COVID-19 could reduce the value of assets under management and/or cause clients to withdraw funds.\nLIBOR Transition Planning. Banking institutions have been planning for the transition away from LIBOR in advance of December 31, 2021, the date that LIBOR is generally expected to cease to exist, although the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority has expressed that it and the Bank of England are assessing the impacts of COVID-19 on progress to meet the expected deadline. It remains unclear, however, whether the cessation of LIBOR will be delayed due to COVID-19 or what form any delay may take, and there are no assurances that there will be a delay. It is also unclear what the duration and severity of COVID-19 will be, and whether this will impact LIBOR transition planning. COVID-19 may also slow regulators\u2019 and others\u2019 efforts to develop and implement alternative reference rates, which could make LIBOR transition planning more difficult, particularly if the cessation of LIBOR is not delayed but alternatives do not develop.\nPPP Loan Participation. As a participating lender in the SBA Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), CTBI and CTB are subject to additional risks of litigation from CTB\u2019s clients or other parties in connection with the CTB\u2019s processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties.\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted, which included a $349 billion loan program administered through the SBA referred to as the PPP. Under the PPP, small businesses, eligible nonprofits and certain others can apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enroll in the program, subject to numerous limitations and eligibility criteria. Under the terms of the PPP, loans are to be fully guaranteed by the SBA. CTB is participating as a lender in the PPP. Because of the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and the April 3, 2020 opening of the PPP, there is some ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP, which exposes CTBI to risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP. On or about April 16, 2020, the SBA notified lenders that the $349 billion earmarked for the PPP was exhausted. Congress approved additional funding for the PPP (increasing the total to $670 billion) and the related new legislation was enacted on April 24, 2020. Since the opening of the PPP, several larger banks have been subject to litigation relating to the policies and procedures that they used in processing applications for the PPP. CTBI and CTB may be exposed to the risk of litigation, from both customers and non-customers that have approached CTB in connection with PPP loans and its policies and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. If any such litigation is filed against CTBI or CTB and is not resolved in a manner favorable to CTBI or CTB, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect CTBI\u2019s reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP-related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCTB also has credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by CTB, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by CTBI, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from CTB.", "PERMNO": 11844, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CTBI"}
