{"cik": "93676", "company": "STARRETT L S CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-09-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nSAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Company\u2019s 2020 Annual Report to Stockholders, including the President\u2019s letter, contain forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s business, competition, sales, gross margins, capital expenditures, foreign operations, plans for reorganization, interest rate sensitivity, debt service, liquidity and capital resources, and other operating and capital requirements. In addition, forward-looking statements may be included in future Company documents and in oral statements by Company representatives to security analysts and investors. The Company is subject to risks that could cause actual events to vary materially from such forward-looking statements, including the following risk factors:\nRisks Related to Our Company and Financial Position\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our sales and pricing if we fail to compete effectively in the future.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. We compete on the basis of a variety of factors, including product performance, customer service, quality and price. Additionally, the Company\u2019s products for the building trades, such as tape measures and levels, are under constant margin pressure due to a channel shift to large national home and hardware retailers. Certain large customers also offer their own private labels \u201cown brand\u201d that compete with Starrett branded products. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies\u2019 products. Thus, our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, our failure to price our products competitively or our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost. Lack of customer acceptance of price increases we announce from time to time, changes in customer requirements for price discounts, changes in our customers\u2019 behavior or a weak pricing environment could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our geographic and product mix of sales.\nEconomic weakness in the industrial manufacturing sector could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe market for most of the Company\u2019s products is subject to economic conditions affecting the industrial manufacturing sector, including the level of capital spending by industrial companies and the general movement of manufacturing to low cost foreign countries where the Company does not have a substantial market presence. Accordingly, economic weakness in the industrial manufacturing sector may, and in some cases has, resulted in decreased demand for certain of the Company\u2019s products, which adversely affects sales and performance. Economic weakness in the consumer market will also adversely impact the Company\u2019s performance. In the event that demand for any of the Company\u2019s products declines significantly, the Company could be required to recognize certain costs as well as asset impairment charges on long-lived assets related to those products.\nThe novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is expected to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. We expect the COVID-19 pandemic to have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and in response to government mandates or recommendations, we have initiated several measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, consumers and communities that has negatively impacted our business, including following state guidelines for social distancing such as, but not limited to, modifying shift schedules, supporting office-base employees working remotely, educating employees and making accommodations related to personal and workplace hygiene, mandating the wearing of masks, daily monitoring of employee\u2019s temperature and regularly communicating accordingly. To immediately address the immediate financial crisis management implemented plans globally in an effort to control variable cost and to preserve cash. These actions included, but are not limited to, wage and salary reductions, furloughs, reduced work weeks and layoffs.\nAdverse global economic conditions and world events could affect our operating results, industry and business.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations have been and may continue to be materially affected by the conditions in the global economy. The demand for our products and services has in the past and continues to be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and business investment, lower levels of business confidence, lower corporate earnings, high real interest rates, lower credit activity or tighter credit conditions, perceived or actual industry overcapacity, higher unemployment and lower consumer spending. During the June quarter 2020 the Company initiated restructuring plans and recorded an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets at two of its reporting units due in large part to the pandemic. Economic conditions vary across regions and countries, and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment. Slower economic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe metalworking, construction, machinery, equipment, aerospace and automotive industries are major users of our products. Customers in these industries frequently base their decisions to purchase our products and services on the expected future performance of these industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictably in response to general economic conditions and trends, government actions, regulatory actions, commodity inventories, production and consumption levels, technological innovations, commodity substitutions, market expectations and any disruptions in production or distribution or changes in consumption. Economic conditions affecting the industries we serve have in the past and may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by our customers. Reduced capital expenditures by our customers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products and services and may also result in a decrease in demand for aftermarket parts as customers are likely to extend preventative maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when possible. The rates of infrastructure spending and commercial construction also play a significant role in our results. Our products are an integral component of these activities, and as these activities decrease, demand for our products may be significantly impacted, which could negatively impact our results.\nSustained increases in funding obligations under the pension plans may impair our liquidity or financial condition.\nThe Company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans in both the United States and the United Kingdom for the benefit of its employees. Defined benefit pension plans impose certain funding obligations on the Company. The Company froze the domestic defined benefit pension plan as of December 31, 2016, and therefore no future benefits will accrue to employees under that plan. Additionally, the Company limited eligibility under the postretirement benefit plan as of December 31, 2013, reducing the liability for the plan. Nevertheless, the Company expects to be required to provide more funding to the domestic pension (and postretirement) plan in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s U.S. defined benefit pension plan is underfunded primarily due to lower discount rates which increase the Company\u2019s liability. The Company made contributions of $6.8 million in fiscal 2020, and $4.4 million in fiscal 2019 and will be required to make additional contributions in fiscal 2021 of $7.0 million for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. The Company\u2019s United Kingdom pension plan, which is also underfunded, required Company contributions of $0.9 million and $1.0 million during fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company expects to make a $0.9 million contribution to its United Kingdom pension plan in fiscal 2021.\nIn determining our future payment obligations under the plans, we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and a certain level of future benefit payments. Significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and result in increased contribution requirements. Our assumptions for future benefit payments may also change over time, and could be materially higher than originally projected.\nWe expect to make contributions to our pension plans in the future, and may be required to make contributions that could be material. We may fund contributions through the use of cash on hand, the proceeds of borrowings, shares of our common stock, or a combination of the foregoing, as permitted by applicable law. We may also explore other strategic alternatives in order to address expected pension liability, including de-risking options or acquisitions or sales of assets or divestitures, in order to meet the Company\u2019s liquidity needs. Divestitures could result in decreased future revenues and profits, and an obligation to make contributions to our pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses, and may have an adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe are subject to certain risks as a result of our financial borrowings.\nAs of June 30, 2020, our total indebtedness was $30.9 million as compared to indebtedness of $21.6 million as of June 30, 2019.\nAs previously disclosed in The L.S. Starrett Company\u2019s (the \u201cCompany\u201d) Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, as a result of a decrease in sales related to the COVID-19 epidemic, the Company anticipated potential non-compliance with its fixed charge coverage ratio for the year ended June 30, 2020 under its Loan and Security Agreement (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company and its U.S. operating companies (collectively, the \u201cBorrowers\u201d) and TD Bank, N.A. (\u201cTD Bank\u201d). On June 25, 2020, the Borrowers and TD Bank entered into an amendment and restatement (the \u201cAmendment and Restatement\u201d) of the Loan Agreement. The Amendment and Restatement waived the fixed charge coverage ratio for the quarter ended June 30, 2020. In addition, the Amendment and Restatement clarifies that certain non-cash adjustments to the definition of EBITDA are permitted under the Loan Agreement, as amended In addition, the Amendment and Restatement increases the permitted borrowings from a foreign bank from $5.0 million to $15.0 million and permits the Company to draw the remainder of the outstanding balance under the Loan Agreement, which was approximately $7.2 million as of June 30, 2020.\nPursuant to the terms of the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement of June 25, 2020, the \u201cFirst Amendment\u201d to this loan agreement was executed on September 17, 2020, which include, among other things, (i) pause testing of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio until September 30, 2021 and (ii) establishment of a new minim um cumulative EBITDA and minimum liquidity covenants in lieu thereof. TD Bank perfected its security interests in the Company\u2019s U.S. based assets, increased the maximum interest charged on the Line Of Credit from and annual interest rate of 2.25% plus Libor to 3.50% plus Libor, and amended the borrowing base for the line of credit from 80% of Qualified AR and 50% of the lower of Cost or Market of US inventory values to 80% of qualified AR plus 85% of the Net Orderly Liquidation Value (NOLV) of US Inventory plus 62.5% of total appraised US real estate values. As a result of this change, the Company is projected to maintain its current borrowing capacity of $25,000,000 under the Line of Credit. The Company underwent a series of appraisals and field exams in all US locations as part of restructuring this agreement. In addition, the Company will provide additional reporting to TD Bank, including monthly profit and loss statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements and forecasting. This minimum adjusted EBITDA covenant is based on the Company\u2019s plan for a slow pandemic recovery throughout FY21 and the impact of the Company\u2019s restructuring plan initiatives. The Company will apply certain proceeds from the sale of US real estate assets against the principle balance of the term loans under the TD Bank loan agreement. The Agreement will revert to the existing covenant package for the quarter ending September 30, 2021 and every quarter thereafter.\nOur operational results are dependent on how well we can scale our manufacturing capacity and resources to the level of our customers\u2019 demand.\nWe sell our products in industries that require manufacturers to make highly efficient use of manufacturing capacity. Insufficient or excess capacity threatens our ability to generate competitive profit margins and may expose us to liabilities such as contractual commitments. Although from time to time we close or consolidate facilities, adapting or modifying our capacity is difficult, as modifications take substantial time to execute, are inherently disruptive and costly and, in some cases, may require regulatory approval. Additionally, delivering products during process or facility modifications requires special coordination. The cost and resources required to adapt our capacity, such as through facility acquisitions, facility closings or process moves between facilities, may negate any planned cost reductions or may result in costly delays, product quality issues or material shortages, all of which could adversely affect our operational results and our reputation with our customers.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\nAcquisitions involve special risks, including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies, difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses, disruption of the Company\u2019s existing business, dissipation of the Company\u2019s limited management resources, and impairment of relationships with employees and customers of the acquired business as a result of changes in ownership and management.\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures. To be successful, we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies and manage post-closing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses. Further, while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through due diligence, among other things, there may be risks and liabilities that our due diligence efforts fail to discover that are not accurately or completely disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess. We may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. Risks associated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following:\n\u25cf\nthe failure to achieve the acquisition's revenue or profit forecast\u037e\n\u25cf\ntechnological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected\u037e\n\u25cf\nunforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to required regulatory approvals or consents\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe acquisition or assumption of unexpected liabilities or the incurrence of unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions\u037e\n\u25cf\nunforeseen difficulties integrating operations, processes and systems\u037e\n\u25cf\nfailure to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business\u037e and\n\u25cf\nproblems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases.\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and attention. They may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction. Failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of such acquisitions or to implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, we consider strategic divestitures from time to time, including divestures of underperforming or non-core assets or divestitures designed to generate cash to extinguish or reduce our liabilities. In the case of divestitures, we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses. These divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses following the transaction, including through guarantees or other financial arrangements. Lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results and divestitures of profitable operations to generate cash could reduce our future revenues and profits. (See Note 6 \u201cGoodwill and Intangibles\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding impairment)\nIf we do not meet customers\u2019 product quality, reliability standards and expectations, we may experience increased or unexpected product warranty claims and other adverse consequences to our business.\nProduct quality and reliability are significant factors influencing customers' decisions to purchase our products. Inability to maintain the high quality of our products relative to the perceived or actual quality of similar products offered by competitors could result in the loss of market share, loss of revenue, reduced profitability, an increase in warranty costs, government investigations and/or damage to our reputation.\nProduct quality and reliability are determined in part by factors that are not entirely within our control. We depend on our suppliers for parts and components that meet our standards. If our suppliers fail to meet those standards, we may not be able to deliver the quality of products that our customers expect, which may impair our reputation, resulting in lower revenue and higher warranty costs.\nWe provide our customers a warranty covering workmanship, and in some cases materials, on products we manufacture. Our warranty generally provides that products will be free from defects for 1 year. If a product fails to comply with the warranty, we may be obligated, at our expense, to correct any defect by repairing or replacing the defective product. Although we maintain warranty reserves in an amount based primarily on the number of units shipped and on historical and anticipated warranty claims, there can be no assurance that future warranty claims will follow historical patterns or that we can accurately anticipate the level of future warranty claims. While the Company has historically not incurred significant warranty expense, an increase in the rate of warranty claims or the occurrence of unexpected warranty claims, for which we are not insured or where we cannot recover from our vendors to the extent their materials or workmanship were defective, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our manufacturing processes and products do not comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, or if we manufacture products containing design or manufacturing defects, demand for our products may decline and we may be subject to product liability claims.\nOur designs, manufacturing processes and facilities need to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. We may also have the responsibility to ensure that products we design satisfy safety and regulatory standards including those applicable to our customers and to obtain any necessary certifications. As a result, products that we manufacture may at times contain manufacturing or design defects, and our manufacturing processes may be subject to errors or not be in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements or demands of our customers. Potential defects in the products we manufacture or design, whether caused by a design, manufacturing or component failure or error, or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, may result in delayed shipments to customers, replacement costs or reduced or canceled customer orders. If these defects or deficiencies are significant, our business reputation may also be damaged. The failure of the products that we manufacture or our manufacturing processes and facilities to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements may subject us to legal fines or penalties and, in some cases, require us to shut down or incur considerable expense to correct a manufacturing process or facility.\nAny manufacturing or design defects may also result in product liability claims. Furthermore, customers use some of our products in potentially hazardous applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property, equipment or the environment. We may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims if an accident occurs at a location where our equipment and services have been or are being used. We also maintain certain insurance policies which may limit our financial exposures. Any significant liabilities which are not covered by insurance could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. Likewise, a substantial increase in the number of claims that are made against us or the amounts of any judgments or settlements could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nVolatility in the price of energy and raw materials, large or rapid increases in the cost of raw materials or components parts, substantial decreases in their availability, or our dependence on particular suppliers of raw materials and component parts could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nSteel is the principal raw material used in the manufacture of the Company\u2019s products. Historically, market prices of some of our key raw materials have fluctuated on a cyclical basis and have often depended on a variety of factors over which the Company has no control, including as a result of tariffs or other trade barriers. If in the future we are not able to reduce product costs in other areas or pass raw material price increases on to our customers, our margins could be adversely affected. In addition, because we maintain limited raw material and component inventories, even brief unanticipated delays in delivery by suppliers-including those due to capacity constraints, labor disputes, impaired financial condition of suppliers, weather emergencies, global pandemics, such as COVID-19, or other natural disasters- may impair our ability to satisfy our customers and could adversely affect our financial performance. The cost of producing the Company\u2019s products is also sensitive to the price of energy. If we are unable to manage pricing from these suppliers effectively or pass future cost increases through to our customers, our financial performance could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our suppliers terminate these agreements and we are unable to procure alternate products at substantially similar competitive pricing, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing expertise.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by changing technology and evolving process development. The continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to:\n\u25cf\nhire, retain and expand our pool of qualified engineering and technical personnel\u037e\n\u25cf\nmaintain technological leadership in our industry\u037e\n\u25cf\nsuccessfully anticipate or respond to changes in manufacturing processes in a cost-effective and timely manner\u037e and\n\u25cf\nsuccessfully anticipate or respond to changes in cost to serve in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nWe cannot be certain that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future. The emergence of new technologies, industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or uncompetitive. We may have to acquire new technologies and equipment to remain competitive. The acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require us to incur significant expense and capital investment, which could reduce our margins and affect our operating results. When we establish new facilities, we may not be able to maintain or develop our engineering, technological and manufacturing expertise due to a lack of trained personnel, effective training of new staff or technical difficulties with machinery. Failure to anticipate and adapt to customers\u2019 changing technological needs and requirements or to hire and retain a sufficient number of engineers and maintain engineering, technological and manufacturing expertise may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIncreased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services. Any inadequacy, interruption, integration failure or security failure with respect to our information technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.\nThe efficient operation of the Company's business is dependent on its information systems, including its ability to operate them effectively and to successfully implement new technologies, systems, controls and adequate disaster recovery systems. In addition, the Company must protect the confidentiality of data of its business, employees, customers and other third parties. Information technology security threats -- from user error to cybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data - are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Cybersecurity attacks could also include attacks targeting customer data or the security, integrity and/or reliability of the hardware and software installed in our products. It is possible that our information technology systems and networks, or those managed by third parties, could have vulnerabilities, which could go unnoticed for a period of time. The failure of the Company's information systems to perform as designed or its failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt the Company's business or subject it to liability and thereby harm its profitability. While the Company continues to enhance the applications contained in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system as well as improvements to other operating systems, there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls we have implemented and are implementing, or which we cause or have caused third party service providers to implement, will be sufficient to protect our systems, information or other property.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights or maintain our rights to use licensed intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur intellectual property, including our patents, trade secrets, trademarks and licenses are important in the operation of our business. Although we intend to protect our intellectual property rights vigorously, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in doing so. Third parties may assert or prosecute infringement claims against us in connection with the services and products that we offer, and we may or may not be able to successfully defend these claims. Litigation, either to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others, could result in substantial costs and in a diversion of our resources.\nIn addition, if a third party would prevail in an infringement claim against us, then we would likely need to obtain a license from the third party on commercial terms, which would likely increase our costs. Our failure to maintain or obtain necessary licenses or an adverse outcome in any litigation relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory\nInternational operations and our financial results in those markets may be affected by legal, regulatory, political, currency exchange and other economic risks.\nDuring the fiscal year 2020, revenue from sales outside of the United States was $87.5 million, representing approximately 43 % of consolidated sales. In addition, a significant amount of our manufacturing and production operations are located, or our products are sourced from, outside the United States. As a result, our business is subject to risks associated with international operations. These risks include the burdens of complying with foreign laws and regulations, unexpected changes in tariffs, taxes or regulatory requirements, changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies, and political unrest and corruption. Regulatory changes could occur in the countries in which we sell, produce or source our products or significantly increase the cost of operating in or obtaining materials originating from certain countries. Restrictions imposed by such changes can have a significant impact on our business.\nIn addition, the functional currency for most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the results of our operations and the value of our foreign assets and liabilities, which in turn may adversely affect results of operations and cash flows and the comparability of period-to-period results of operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we and foreign competitors sell products in the same market. Foreign governmental policies and actions regarding currency valuation could result in actions by the United States and other countries to offset the effects of such fluctuations. Given the unpredictability and volatility of foreign currency exchange rates, ongoing or unusual volatility may adversely impact our business and financial conditions.\nCountries in which our products are manufactured or sold may from time to time impose additional new regulations, or modify existing regulations, including:\n\u25cf\nchanges in duties, taxes, tariffs and other charges on imports;\n\u25cf\nlimitations on the quantity of goods which may be imported into the United States from a particular country;\n\u25cf\nrequirements as to where products and/or inputs are manufactured or sourced;\n\u25cf\ncreation of export licensing requirements, imposition of restrictions on export quantities or specification of minimum export pricing and/or export prices or duties;\n\u25cf\ncurrency fluctuations;\n\u25cf\nlimitations on foreign owned businesses; or\n\u25cf\ngovernment actions to cancel contracts, re-denominate the official currency, renounce or default on obligations, renegotiate terms unilaterally or expropriate assets.\nIn addition, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, public corruption and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations. All of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with laws, rules and regulations could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of federal, state, local and international laws, rules and regulations, such as state and local wage and hour laws, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), the False Claims Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), securities laws, import and export laws (including customs regulations) and many others. We may also be subject to investigations or audits by governmental authorities and regulatory agencies, which can occur in the ordinary course of business or which can result from increased scrutiny from a particular agency towards an industry, country or practice. Such investigations or audits may subject us to increased government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States.\nFurthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the United States and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification may expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or in certain locations the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nIn addition, as a result of operating in multiple countries, we must comply with multiple foreign laws and regulations that may differ substantially from country to country and may conflict with corresponding U.S. laws and regulations. The FCPA and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our operations outside the United States, including in developing countries, expose us to the risk of such violations. If we fail to comply with laws, rules and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, we may be subject to government enforcement action, class action litigation or other litigation, damage to our reputation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, and increased cost of regulatory compliance, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance.\nCosts associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in various claims and lawsuits that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business. The industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims, investigations and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition in any particular period. The global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. In addition, subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.\nOur tax rate is dependent upon a number of factors, a change in any of which could impact our future tax rates and net income.\nOur future tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the enactment of certain tax legislation being considered in the United States and other countries; other changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws; changes in the estimated realization of our net deferred tax assets; the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. income and non-U.S. withholding taxes; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes, including impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions; changes in available tax credits; and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities. Losses for which no tax benefits can be recorded could materially impact our tax rate and its volatility from one quarter to another. Any significant change in our jurisdictional earnings mix or in the tax laws in those jurisdictions could impact our future tax rates and net income in those periods.", "PERMNO": 18438, "SIC": 3420, "TIC": "SCX"}
