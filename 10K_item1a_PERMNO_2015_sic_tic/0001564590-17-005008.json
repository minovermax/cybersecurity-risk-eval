{"cik": "890264", "company": "EXA CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as overall U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditions including a global economic slowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and liquidity.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe depend on our PowerFLOW suite of simulation solutions for substantially all of our revenue, and our business will suffer if demand for, or usage of, PowerFLOW declines.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from subscription licenses to use our PowerFLOW software suite and related services. We expect revenue from PowerFLOW to continue to account for substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future. If demand for, or usage of, PowerFLOW declines for any reason, our revenue would decline and our operating results would suffer.\nEconomic downturns that affect the ground transportation industry may adversely affect our revenues and operating results.\nWe derive a substantial majority of our total revenue from companies in the ground transportation industry. Accordingly, our future success depends upon the continued demand for digital simulation software and services by companies in this industry. The ground transportation industry and the other manufacturing industries that we serve, or may expand into, periodically experience economic downturns that can adversely affect our business. For example, we were negatively impacted by the suspension or postponement of vehicle development programs by our customers in response to the 2008 financial crisis and resulting recession, which significantly affected the automotive industry. Furthermore, political unrest, terrorist attacks, other increased global hostilities and natural disasters have, at times, contributed to widespread uncertainty and speculation in the world financial markets. The impact of events of this kind may be exacerbated by other economic factors, such as increased operating and manufacturing costs due to rising global energy prices, the tightening of the financial and credit markets, changes or reduced clarity in regulatory requirements, and by changes in commercial and consumer preferences and spending habits. In the future, such cyclical trends and economic factors may adversely affect our business by reducing customer capital expenditures, extending design cycles and reducing our revenue and, ultimately, our results of operations. In addition, manufacturers in the ground transportation market tend to adhere to a technology choice for long periods, possibly an entire product development cycle. As a result, a lost opportunity with a given customer may not again become a new opportunity for several years or projects may be delayed if development of a new product is put on hold or terminated.\nAdverse changes in the economy and global economic and political uncertainty may also cause delays and reductions in information technology spending by our customers and a deterioration of the markets for our products and services. If adverse economic conditions occur, we would likely experience reductions, delays and postponements of customer purchases that will negatively impact our revenue and operating results.\nIn the past, worldwide economic downturns and pricing pressures have led to reorganizations of companies in the automotive industry. Such reorganizations have in the past caused delays and reductions in capital and operating expenditures including for products and services like ours. In addition, a consolidation or reorganization affecting a significant customer could result in discontinuation of use by the acquired company of our simulation solutions, if the acquiring company has not adopted our technology or prefers other methods of design verification. Domestic and foreign economic conditions or any other factors that result in reduced spending on new product development by companies in the automotive industry could harm our operating results in the future.\nSignificant changes in U.S. policy could have an adverse effect on us.\nChanges in or uncertainty regarding future U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing energy policy, foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business.\nOur success depends on continued adoption of digital simulation in our target markets, and if potential customers are unwilling to adopt our digital simulation technologies to augment or replace their traditional physical methods of design validation and testing, our opportunities for future revenue growth may be limited.\nMost of our customers and potential customers have historically tested their product designs using experimental methods such as wind tunnels and road tests. Manufacturers often have made substantial investments in physical test facilities and associated staff and infrastructure and have accumulated many years of experience in using these methods. For organizational, cultural, financial or other reasons, potential customers may be reluctant to reduce their reliance on physical experimental methods as the primary means to validate and test their designs. If we are not successful in overcoming these obstacles by demonstrating to potential customers that the results of digital simulation using PowerFLOW can be delivered in a timely and cost effective manner and are sufficiently reliable to be used as the basis of design decisions, they may not adopt, or may delay broader adoption of, our digital simulation technology, which could limit our opportunities for revenue growth and adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent on a small number of significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenues.\nA significant portion of our revenues is derived from renewals by our existing customers of annual licenses to use PowerFLOW, and in any fiscal period, a large portion of our revenue is typically attributable to a small number of significant customers. In fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately 61%, 64% and 58% of our revenue, respectively, was attributable to our ten largest customers in the aggregate. One customer accounted for approximately 10%, 12% and 10% of our revenue in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In the past we have experienced revenue fluctuations within this concentrated account base due to customer internal budget constraints, corporate policy mandates regarding use of simulation tools, experimentation with alternative solutions and consolidation of independent companies or divisions. Due to the concentration of revenue in a small number of customers, a significant reduction in usage of PowerFLOW by any of these customers, or the non-renewal of their annual licenses, due to the cancellation or postponement of vehicle development programs or for any other reason, could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nBecause our business relies heavily on foreign operations and revenues, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and our need to convert currencies may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause most of our international sales are denominated in the currency of the country where the purchaser is located, as we continue to expand our direct sales presence in international regions, our accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase. As a result, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies may affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flow. Currently, our largest exposures to foreign exchange rates exist with respect to the euro and the Japanese yen. We do not currently hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Any hedging policies we may implement in the future may not be successful, and the cost of those hedging techniques may have a significant negative impact on our operating results. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and, in some circumstances, may have a significant impact on our operating results. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can cost-effectively mitigate these risks.\nOur lengthy and technical sales cycle makes it difficult for us to predict the timing of our entry into new license agreements.\nThe development of our business relationship with a potential customer can be a lengthy process, typically spanning three to six months or longer. Our strategy is to engage initially with new customers, or with new engineering groups within existing customers, by performing fixed-price projects. Once new customers are familiar with the capabilities of our products, they generally, but not always, transition to a license-based model for access to PowerFLOW. Because the license fees for our products can be substantial and the internal process changes necessary for a customer to implement our solution can be significant, the software license sales cycle may involve multiple divisions within a potential customer\u2019s organization and multiple layers of management. Due to the length and complicated nature of our sales cycle, predicting the fiscal period in which a new license agreement will be entered into, if at all, is difficult. Delays in booking new license agreements could cause our quarterly revenues to fall substantially below our expectations and those of public market analysts and investors. Delays in sales could cause significant shortfalls in our revenue and operating results for any particular period.\nCompetition from software offered by current competitors and new market entrants, as well from internally developed solutions by our customers, could adversely affect our ability to sell our software products and related services and could result in pressure to price our products in a manner that reduces our profitability.\nThe market for digital simulation software is characterized by vigorous competition. We consider the primary competition to adoption of our solutions to be our customers\u2019 continued use of physical prototypes and test facilities. We also encounter competition from companies that provide multi-function digital simulation software that is used for various purposes in the ground transportation industry and elsewhere, primarily Siemens, with its products STAR-CD and STAR-CCM+, and ANSYS, with its products Fluent and CFX. Siemens has a strong presence in the automotive market, and offers capabilities in certain areas where we do not currently focus, such as combustion. ANSYS offers a suite of digital simulation software that includes many applications that we do not address, such as structural mechanics and electromagnetism, which it markets to a broad spectrum of industries. We also compete against open source software such as OpenFOAM that includes computational fluid dynamics capabilities. In addition, some of our customers have attempted, and may in the future attempt, to develop digital simulation software solutions internally.\nIn most of our existing and potential new accounts, products such as these are already in use for a variety of purposes, and likely will remain so. Our ability to further penetrate the ground transportation market will therefore depend on our ability to demonstrate that our solutions deliver economic value in the form of significant process and cost improvements that competing products are unable to provide. As we expand our offerings into other markets, we may face competition from the same competitors as well as from companies that we have not typically competed against in the past. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources than we have and may expand into our markets by acquiring other companies or otherwise. As a result, these companies may be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services, or other incentives that we cannot match or offer. We have experienced existing and potential customers perceiving the cost of our solution as being higher than that of our competitors\u2019 products or an internally developed solution. This perception could become an obstacle to wider adoption of our simulation solutions, result in pressure to reduce our prices or change our capacity-based pricing model, or prompt our customers to explore lower cost solutions. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or internally developed solutions and competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to develop and introduce new and enhanced products and we may not be able to timely develop new and enhanced products to satisfy changes in demand.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to develop and market new and enhanced solutions on a timely basis. Successful product development and marketing depends on numerous factors, including our ability to anticipate customer requirements, changes in technology, our ability to differentiate our products and solutions from those of our competitors, and market acceptance. Enterprises are requiring their application software vendors to provide greater levels of functionality and broader product offerings. Moreover, our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards and operating platforms. We may not be able to develop and market new or enhanced solutions in a timely or cost-effective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements. Our products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly anticipate technological changes. In particular, a critical component of our growth strategy is to increase the penetration and expansion of PowerFLOW and our related products with our existing customers in the ground transportation market. We may not be successful in developing and marketing, on a timely basis, new products or product enhancements, or adequately addressing the changing needs of our customers and potential customers or successfully increasing the penetration of PowerFLOW and our related products in our existing, or any other, markets.\nChanges in or interpretations of financial accounting standards may have an adverse impact on our reported results of operations.\nChanges in or interpretations of financial accounting standards may have an adverse impact on our reported results of operations. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and various bodies formed to interpret and create accounting standards. It is possible that future requirements, including the recently released guidance related to revenue recognition (ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606), could change our current application of GAAP, resulting in a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations or financial position, and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective.\nNew accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the question of current practices may harm our operating results or the way we conduct our business.\nThe significant cost of deep deployment of our solutions could deter their wider adoption.\nUnder our capacity-based license model, license fees are based on simulation capacity, purchased on an annual basis. Increased utilization, or continued usage after the expiration of the license term, requires the purchase of additional simulation capacity. As customers increase their reliance on our digital simulation solutions and deploy them more widely within their organizations, their consumption of our simulation capacity increases. For example, one customer has expanded the annual simulation capacity it purchases from us by a factor of over 50 times over a period of six years. At some point, the significant cost of implementing our solutions pervasively throughout their organizations under a capacity-based licensing model may deter our customers from more widely adopting our solutions, which could limit our prospects for growth.\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain necessary licenses of third-party technology on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which could delay product sales and development and adversely impact product quality.\nWe have incorporated third-party licensed technology into certain of our products. We anticipate that we are also likely to need to license additional technology from third parties in connection with the development of new products or product enhancements in the future. Third-party licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The inability to retain any third-party licenses required in our current products or to obtain any new third-party licenses to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost, and delay or prevent us from making these products or enhancements, any of which could seriously harm the competitive position of our products.\nOur success in penetrating new vertical markets will depend, in part, on our ability to develop a deep understanding of the challenges facing potential customers in those markets.\nWe have historically concentrated our development efforts primarily on the ground transportation market. While we anticipate that the substantial majority of our revenues will continue to be derived from the ground transportation market for the foreseeable future, in order to achieve our long-term growth goals, we will need to penetrate additional vertical markets, such as the aerospace, oil and gas production, chemical processing, architecture and construction, power generation, biomedical and electronics industries. Our success in the ground transportation market depends on our deep understanding of the design processes utilized by our customers in that market. In order to penetrate new vertical markets, we will need to develop a similar understanding of the design processes, and associated technical difficulties, utilized by participants in those markets. Developing this level of understanding has been and will continue to be a time consuming and potentially expensive process, and we may not be successful. We will also need to demonstrate to potential customers that PowerFLOW and our other products and services can provide digital simulation solutions that compare favorably to physical testing methods as well as the offerings by our competitors with respect to cost, accuracy, set-up time and ease of use. If we fail to penetrate these new vertical markets, our revenue may grow at a slower rate than we anticipate and our financial condition could suffer.\nIf there are interruptions or delays in our ExaCLOUD services due to third-party error, our own error or the occurrence of unforeseeable events, delivery of our solutions and the use of our service could become impaired, which could harm our relationships with customers and subject us to liability.\nWe provide ExaCLOUD services primarily through data centers operated by IBM and Equinix under agreements pursuant to which these companies provide the data center hosting infrastructures. Design and mechanical errors, spikes in usage volume and failure to follow system protocols and procedures could cause our systems, or those in the data centers, to fail, resulting in interruptions in our service. Interruptions or delays in our ExaCLOUD service could result from the termination of our arrangement with either IBM or Equinix, third-party error, our own error, natural disasters or security breaches. Such interruptions or delays, whether accidental or willful, could harm our relationships with customers, damage our brand and reputation, divert our employees\u2019 attention, reduce our revenue, subject us to liability, cause us to issue credits or cause customers to fail to renew their subscriptions, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our security measures, or those of third-party providers for our ExaCLOUD services are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to client data, clients may curtail or stop their use of our solutions, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ExaCLOUD services involve the storage and transmission of confidential information of customers, including their design data. We may also in the course of our service engagements have access to such confidential customer information. If our, or our third-party service providers\u2019, security measures were ever breached as a result of employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party obtained access to this confidential data, our reputation could be damaged, our business could suffer and we could incur significant liability. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not discovered until launched against a target. As a result, we and our third-party providers may be unable to anticipate\nthese techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our or our third-party suppliers\u2019 security occurs, the market perception of our ExaCLOUD services could be harmed and we could lose sales and clients.\nDefects or errors in our products could harm our reputation, impair our ability to sell our products and result in significant costs to us.\nPowerFLOW and the other products that we offer are complex and, despite extensive testing and quality control, may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released. We have not suffered significant harm from any defects or errors to date, but we have from time to time found defects in our products and we may discover additional defects in the future. We may not find errors in new or enhanced products before the products are released and such errors may not be discovered by us or our customers until after the products have been implemented. We have in the past issued and may in the future need to issue corrective releases of our products to remedy defects and errors. Any of these problems may result in the loss of or delay in customer acceptance and sales of our products, which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe could be subject to significant expenses and damages because of liability claims related to our products and services.\nOur customers\u2019 reliance on our digital simulation solutions or project-based services in their vehicle design processes may entail the risk of product liability claims and associated damages, and our software products and services could give rise to warranty and other claims. As we expand into new market segments outside the ground transportation industry, the risk of product liability exposure may increase. Any errors, defects, performance problems or other failure of our software could result in significant liability to us for damages or for violations of environmental, safety and other laws and regulations. Our agreements with our customers generally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims. It is possible, however, that the limitation of liability provisions in our agreements may not be effective as a result of federal, foreign, state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions. A substantial product liability judgment against us could materially and adversely harm our operating results and financial condition. Even if our software is not at fault, a product liability claim brought against us could be time consuming, costly to defend and harmful to our operations. In addition, although we carry general liability insurance, our current insurance coverage may be insufficient to protect us from all liability that may be imposed under these types of claims.\nSeasonal variations in the purchasing patterns of our customers may lead to fluctuations in the timing of our cash flows.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal variations in the timing of customers\u2019 purchases of our software products. Many customers make purchase decisions based on their fiscal year budgets, which often coincide with the calendar year, except for our customers in Japan. These seasonal trends materially affect the timing of our cash flows, as license fees become due at the time the license term commences. As a result, customer orders for new and renewal licenses have been concentrated in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, and our cash flows from operations have been highest in the first quarter of the succeeding fiscal year.\nDeclines in new software license sales or in the rate of renewal of our software may not be fully reflected in our current period operating results and could lead to future revenue shortfalls that could affect our results of operations.\nBecause our software products are sold pursuant to annual subscription agreements and we recognize revenue from these subscriptions over the term of the agreement, downturns or upturns in new or renewal licenses may not be fully reflected in our current period operating results. We do not intend to report or disclose our bookings or invoices on a current basis. If our new and renewal license purchases in any period decline or fail to grow at a rate consistent with our historical trends, particularly in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, when a disproportionate percentage of our new license and renewal sales typically occur, our revenue in future periods could fall short of analysts\u2019 expectations which, in turn, could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur cost structure is relatively fixed in the short term, which makes it difficult to reduce our expenses quickly in response to declines in revenue or revenue growth.\nMost of our expenses, such as those associated with headcount and facilities, are relatively fixed and can be difficult to reduce in the short term. Our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels. As a result, if revenue for a particular quarter is below our expectations, our expenses for that quarter may constitute a larger percentage of our operating budget than we planned, causing a disproportionate effect on our expected results of operations and profitability for that quarter.\nIf we are unable to manage our expected growth, our performance may suffer.\nOur business has grown rapidly, and if we are successful in executing our business strategy, this growth will continue as we expand our offerings in the ground transportation market and seek to penetrate new vertical markets. We will need to continue to\nexpand our managerial, operational, financial and other systems and resources to manage our operations, continue our research and development activities, increase our sales force and expand project-based services by increasing our field application engineers and worldwide support staff. It is possible that our management, finance, development personnel, systems and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. Our need to effectively manage our operations, growth and products requires that we continue to develop more robust business processes and improve our systems and procedures in each of these areas and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees. We may be unable to successfully implement these tasks on a larger scale and, accordingly, may not achieve our research, development and growth goals.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract, integrate and retain key personnel.\nOur success in the highly competitive digital simulation market depends largely on our ability to attract, integrate and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, consulting, sales and marketing personnel globally. Competition for these personnel in our industry is intense. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain the appropriately qualified, highly skilled employees necessary for the development of our products and services and the growth of our business, or to replace such personnel who leave our employ in the future. Our ability to attract and retain these resources may also be impacted by the immigration policies of a number of countries. The loss of services of any of our key personnel, the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future, or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly scientific, product development and applications management personnel, could make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective product introductions, penetration and expansion into existing accounts and growth in our share of the domestic and international digital simulation market.\nWe may expand by acquiring or investing in other companies, which may divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and consume resources that are necessary to sustain our business.\nAlthough we have no agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions, our business strategy may in the future include acquiring complementary services, technologies or businesses. We also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our service offerings or our ability to provide service in foreign jurisdictions, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, developing channels of distribution or investments in other companies. Negotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult and expensive, and our ability to close these transactions may often be subject to approvals that are beyond our control. Consequently, these transactions, even if undertaken and announced, may not close.\nAn acquisition, investment or business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of the acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to work for us, the company\u2019s technology is not easily adapted to work with ours or we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in management or otherwise. Acquisitions may also disrupt our business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our business. Moreover, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment or business relationship may not be realized or we may be exposed to unknown liabilities. Our acquisitions may not be successfully integrated or any such acquisitions may not otherwise be successful. If our acquisitions are unsuccessful for any reason, our business may be harmed and the value of your investment may decline.\nWe sell our products and services internationally and are subject to various risks relating to these international activities; if we fail to manage our international operations effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nInternational sales of PowerFLOW and our related products and services are important to our growth and profitability. In the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017, 74% of our revenue was attributable to sales in international markets, and at January 31, 2017, we had 15 offices in eight countries. By doing business in international markets, we are exposed to risks separate and distinct from those we face in our domestic operations, and if we are unable to manage the various risks associated with supporting our international sales and service efforts effectively, the growth and profitability of our business may be adversely affected.\nEngaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets;\n\u2022\nburdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign customs, laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nburdens of complying with United States laws regulating international business activities, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and economic and trade sanctions regimes;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters or outbreaks of infectious diseases affecting the regions in which our customers operate;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs or trade protection measures;\n\u2022\nimport or export licensing requirements and other restrictions on technology imports and exports;\n\u2022\npotentially negative consequences from changes in foreign government regulations, tax laws and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in managing a geographically dispersed workforce in compliance with diverse local laws and customs;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ndisproportionate management attention or company resources;\n\u2022\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships;\n\u2022\ninternational terrorism and anti-American sentiment;\n\u2022\npossible future limitations on the ownership of foreign businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable payment cycles;\n\u2022\nless effective protection of intellectual property; and\n\u2022\nthe challenges of handling legal disputes in foreign jurisdictions.\nOur exposure to each of these risks may increase our costs, impair our ability to market and sell our products and require significant management attention. Our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate, and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of amounts that have been accrued.\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and we may take certain income tax positions on our tax returns that tax authorities may disagree with. When necessary, we provide reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions. However, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax regulations to our global operations in many jurisdictions. Therefore, any dispute with any tax authority may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities associated with our returns.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate. In the United States, there are several proposals to reform corporate tax law that are currently under consideration. These proposals include reducing the corporate statutory tax rate, broadening the corporate tax base through the elimination or reduction of deductions, exclusions and credits, implementing a territorial regime of taxation, limiting the ability of United States corporations to deduct interest expense associated with offshore earnings, modifying the foreign tax credit rules, and reducing the ability to defer United States tax on offshore earnings. These or other changes in the United States tax laws could increase our effective tax rate which would affect our profitability.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitation.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset our taxable income. Specifically, this limitation may arise in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of our company of more than 50% within a three-year period. Any such annual limitation may significantly reduce the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire. Future transactions in our common stock could trigger an ownership change for purposes of Section 382, which could limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and other attributes that could be utilized annually in the future to offset our taxable income, if any. Any such limitation, whether as the result of sales of common stock by our existing stockholders or sales of common stock by us, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future years.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, management determined that we experienced an ownership change for purposes of Section 382. This ownership change resulted in annual limitations to the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future taxable income, if any, at the federal level. The annual limit is approximately $16.8 million for each of fiscal years 2016 through 2019, $8.0 million for fiscal year 2020 and $6.4 million for each fiscal year thereafter. The ownership change also resulted in the loss of our ability to utilize approximately $0.8 million of state net operating loss carryforwards, credits and other state attributes, which resulted in a write-off of the $0.8 million of state deferred tax assets during the first quarter of fiscal year 2015.\nWe may need substantial additional funding and we may be unable to raise capital when needed, which could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors, many of which are outside our control, including:\n\u2022\nfuture revenue generation;\n\u2022\nfuture operating expenses, including planned increases in our research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses;\n\u2022\nthe cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending and enforcing our patent and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe cost of defending, in litigation or otherwise, any claims that we infringe third party intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments; and\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies, although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions.\nHistorically, we have financed our operations and internal growth primarily through private placements of our equity securities and debt and through our initial public offering. We cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts acceptable to us, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, you may experience dilution. Furthermore, any new securities we issue may have rights, preferences and privileges superior to our common stock. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights in internally developed software and other materials and efforts to protect them may be costly.\nOur ability to compete effectively is dependent in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in our software and other materials that we have developed internally. While we hold issued patents and pending patent applications covering certain elements of our technology, these patents, and, more generally, existing patent laws, may not provide adequate protection for portions of the technology that are important to our business. In addition, our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents. We have largely relied on copyright, trade secret and, to a lesser extent, trademark laws, as well as generally relying on confidentiality procedures and agreements with our employees, consultants, customers and vendors, to control access to, and distribution of, technology, software, documentation and other confidential information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain, use or distribute our technology without authorization. If this were to occur, we could lose revenue as a result of competition from products infringing or misappropriating our technology and intellectual property and we may be required to initiate litigation to protect our proprietary rights and market position.\nUnited States patent, copyright and trade secret laws offer us only limited protection and the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent. Accordingly, defense of our proprietary technology may become an increasingly important issue as we continue to expand our operations and product development into countries that provide a lower level of intellectual property protection than the United States. Policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and the steps we take may not prevent misappropriation of the technology we rely on. If competitors are able to use our technology without recourse, our ability to compete would be harmed and our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may elect to initiate litigation in the future to enforce or protect our proprietary rights or to determine the validity and scope of the rights of others. That litigation may not be ultimately successful and could result in substantial costs to us, the reduction or loss in intellectual property protection for our technology, the diversion of our management attention and harm to our reputation, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAssertions by any other third party that we infringe its intellectual property, whether successful or not, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation and expensive licenses.\nThe software and technology industries are characterized by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our products and services do not infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. Additionally, because our software is integrated with our\ncustomers\u2019 business processes and other software applications, third parties may bring claims of infringement against us, as well as our customers and other software suppliers, if the cause of the alleged infringement cannot be easily determined. Although we believe that our intellectual property rights are sufficient to allow us to market our products and services without incurring liability to third parties, third parties may bring claims of infringement or misappropriation against us. No third party has pursued claims of this type against us to date. However, such claims of alleged infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties could be asserted against us in the future. We cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claim. In addition to possible claims with respect to our proprietary information, some of our products contain technology developed by and licensed from third parties and we may likewise be susceptible to infringement or misappropriation claims with respect to these third party technologies.\nClaims of alleged infringement of third party intellectual property rights may have a material adverse effect on our business. Any intellectual property rights claim made against us or our customers, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle, and could divert management attention and financial resources. An adverse determination could prevent us from offering our products or services to our customers and may require that we procure or develop substitute products or services that do not infringe. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements. We may be unable to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. Furthermore, many of our license agreements require us to indemnify our customers for certain third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase our costs as a result of defending such claims and may require that we pay damages if there were an adverse ruling related to any such claims. Even if we are not a party to any litigation between a customer and a third party, an adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us to defend our intellectual property in any subsequent litigation in which we are a named party. Moreover, such infringement claims may harm our relationships with our existing customers and may deter future customers from subscribing to our services on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of employees\u2019 former employers.\nWe could in the future be subject to claims that we or our employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of our employees\u2019 former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending against such claims, a court could order us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from using technologies or features that are essential to our products if such technologies or features are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. In addition, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to develop, market and support potential products or product enhancements, which could severely harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, such litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nOur use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to provide our services, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe utilize open source software in our products. The use and distribution of open source software can lead to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software, as open source software does not come with warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. From time to time parties have asserted claims against companies that distribute or use open source software in their products and services, asserting that open source software infringes their intellectual property rights. We could be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement of intellectual property rights with respect to what we believe to be open source software. In such event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue using such software or offering certain of our services or to discontinue the use of such software or the sale of our affected services in the event we could not obtain such licenses, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under some of the open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software.\nRisks Related Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe JOBS Act allows us to postpone the date by which we must comply with certain laws and regulations intended to protect investors and to reduce the amount of information we provide in our reports filed with the SEC, which could undermine investor confidence in our company and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe JOBS Act, which was enacted in April 2012, is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d As defined in the JOBS Act, a public company whose initial public offering of common equity securities occurred after December 8, 2011 and whose annual gross revenues are less than $1.0 billion will, in general, qualify as an emerging growth company until the earliest of:\n\u2022\nthe last day of its fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of its initial public offering of common equity securities;\n\u2022\nthe last day of its fiscal year in which it has annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more;\n\u2022\nthe date on which it has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; and\n\u2022\nthe date on which it is deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d which will occur at such time as the company (a) has an aggregate worldwide market value of common equity securities held by non-affiliates of $700 million or more as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter, (b) has been required to file annual and quarterly reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for a period of at least 12 months, and (c) has filed at least one annual report pursuant to the Securities Act of 1934.\nUnder this definition, we will cease to be an emerging growth company as of January 31, 2018.\nThe JOBS Act provides that, so long as a company qualifies as an emerging growth company, it will, among other things:\n\u2022\nbe exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that its independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nbe exempt from the \u201csay on pay\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding stockholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive officers) and the \u201csay on golden parachute\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding stockholder vote to approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and certain other business combinations) of the Dodd-Frank Act and certain disclosure requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to compensation of its chief executive officer;\n\u2022\nbe permitted to omit the detailed compensation discussion and analysis from proxy statements and reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and instead provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation; and\n\u2022\nbe exempt from any rules that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report on the financial statements.\nWe have irrevocably elected not to take advantage of the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards available under Section 102(b) of the JOBS Act. We currently intend to take advantage of some or all of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to us so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d. Among other things, this means that our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected. Likewise, so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we may elect not to provide you with certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of our executive officers, that we would otherwise have been required to provide in filings we make with the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our company. As a result, investor confidence in our company and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nWe expect that the significant legal, accounting and other expenses we incur as a public company will increase once we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d.\nOur revenue, operating results and gross margin have historically fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter, and we expect they will continue to do so, which could cause the trading price of our stock to decline.\nOur quarterly revenue and results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If our quarterly revenue or results of operations fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Fluctuations in our results of operations may be due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those listed below and identified throughout this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n\u2022\nour recognition of project revenues during the quarter in which services are completed, rather than ratably over the period of performance of services;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers and attract new customers;\n\u2022\nchanges in the volume and mix of products sold in a particular quarter;\n\u2022\nseasonality of our business cycle, given that our cash flows from operating activities are typically significantly higher in our first fiscal quarter;\n\u2022\nour policy of expensing sales commissions on license and project sales;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of new product introductions or upgrades by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve anticipated levels of customer acceptance of our existing or new applications or platform changes;\n\u2022\nfailure to expand the utilization of PowerFLOW in our customer base or to penetrate new customers and market segments;\n\u2022\nunexpected outcomes of matters relating to litigation;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in tax rates and tax laws;\n\u2022\nfailure to effectively protect our intellectual property, especially in developing countries;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies;\n\u2022\nrenegotiation or termination of royalty or intellectual property arrangements;\n\u2022\nunanticipated impact of accounting for technology acquisitions, if any;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, particularly in countries where we derive a significant portion of our revenue;\n\u2022\ngreater than anticipated expenses or a failure to maintain cost controls;\n\u2022\ncompetition, including entry into the market by new competitors and new product offerings by existing competitors;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of expenditures related to expanding our operations, research and development, or introducing new products;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in the licensing or payment terms for our products and services; and\n\u2022\nthe purchasing and budgeting cycles of our customers.\nCustomers may choose not to renew annual licenses, resulting in reduced revenue to us. In addition, customers may wish to negotiate renewals of licenses on terms and conditions that require us to change the way we recognize revenue under our existing revenue recognition practices at the time of such renewal with such customers. Any such changes could result in a material adverse effect on our results.\nWe expect that the factors listed above and other risks discussed in this report will continue to affect our operating results for the foreseeable future. Because of the factors listed above and other risks discussed in this report, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, our stockholders\u2019 ability to achieve a return on their investment in our common stock will depend on the appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund our future growth and do not expect to declare or pay any dividend on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a price above your cost. The price of our common stock may not appreciate in value or ever exceed the price that you paid for shares of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions in Delaware law, might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:\n\u2022\nproviding for three classes of directors with the term of office of one class expiring each year, commonly referred to as a staggered board;\n\u2022\nauthorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings and to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board and stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nlimiting the determination of the number of directors on our board and the filling of vacancies or newly created seats on the board to our board of directors then in office; and providing that directors may be removed by stockholders only for cause.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation law, which prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.", "PERMNO": 13454, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "EXA"}
