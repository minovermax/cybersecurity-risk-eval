{"cik": "1220754", "company": "PROVIDENCE SERVICE CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nThe following risks should be read in conjunction with other information contained, or incorporated by reference, in this report, including the \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d section and our consolidated financial statements and related notes. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nGeneral Risks\nOur annual operating results and stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nOur annual operating results and the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in rates or coverage for services by payers;\n\u2022\nchanges in Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state rules, regulations, policies or applicable foreign regulations;\n\u2022\nthe development of increased competition;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;\n\u2022\nchanges in the competitive landscape of the market for our services, including new entrants to the market;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nincreased competition in any of our segments, including through insourcing of services by our clients;\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters or responses to these events; and\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles.\nIn addition, the stock markets, and in particular the NASDAQ Global Market, have experienced considerable price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we become involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs, and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.\nWe obtain a significant portion of our business through responses to government requests for proposals and we may not be awarded contracts through this process in the future, or contracts we are awarded may not be profitable.\nWe obtain, and will continue to seek to obtain, a significant portion of our business from national, state, and local government entities. To obtain business from government entities, we are often required to respond to RFPs. To propose effectively, we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract, the time required to establish operations and the terms of the proposals submitted by competitors. We must also assemble and submit a large volume of information within rigid and often short timetables. Our ability to respond successfully to RFPs will greatly impact our business. We may not be awarded contracts through the RFP process, and our proposals may not result in profitable contracts.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with officials of government entities and agencies, we may not be able to successfully procure or retain government-sponsored contracts, which could negatively impact our revenues.\nTo facilitate our ability to procure or retain government-sponsored contracts, we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies. These relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to the government entities and agencies prior to the development of an RFP or program for privatization of healthcare and workforce development services and we believe they enhance our chances of procuring contracts with these payers. The effectiveness of our relationships may be reduced or eliminated with changes in the personnel holding various government offices or staff positions. We also may lose key personnel who have these relationships. We may be unable to successfully manage our relationships with government entities and agencies and with elected officials and appointees. Any failure to establish, maintain or manage relationships with government and agency personnel may hinder our ability to procure or retain government-sponsored contracts.\nGovernment unions may oppose privatizing government programs to outside vendors such as us, which could limit our market opportunities.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to win contracts to administer and manage programs traditionally administered by government employees. Many government employees, however, belong to labor unions with considerable financial resources and lobbying networks. These unions could apply opposing political pressure on legislators and other officials seeking to privatize government programs. Union opposition could result in our losing government contracts or being precluded from providing services under government contracts, or maintaining or renewing existing contracts. The ability to renew and obtain new contracts is critical to our financial success. If we could not renew certain contracts, or obtain new contracts, due to opposition political actions, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nInaccurate, misleading or negative media coverage could damage our reputation and harm our ability to procure government sponsored contracts.\nThe media sometimes provides news coverage about our contracts and the services we or our competitors provide to clients in our sectors. This media coverage, if negative, could influence government officials to slow the pace of privatizing or retendering government services. Moreover, inaccurate, misleading or negative media coverage about us could harm our reputation and, accordingly, our ability to obtain government sponsored contracts.\nOur business is subject to risks of litigation.\nThe services we provide across our three segments are subject to lawsuits and claims. A substantial award could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows, and could adversely impact our ability to continue to purchase appropriate liability insurance. We can be subject to claims for negligence or intentional misconduct (in addition to professional liability type claims) by an employee or a third party we engage to assist with the provision of services, including but not limited to claims arising out of accidents involving vehicle collisions, workforce development placements or CHAs and various claims that could result from employees or contracted third parties driving to or from interactions with clients and while providing direct client services. We can be subject to employee related claims such as wrongful discharge or discrimination or a violation of equal employment laws and permitting issues. While we are insured for these types of claims, damages exceeding our insurance limits or outside our insurance coverage, such as a claim for fraud, certain wage and hour violations or punitive damages, could adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition.\nWe face substantial competition in attracting and retaining experienced professionals, and we may be unable to sustain or grow our business if we cannot attract and retain qualified employees.\nOur success depends to a significant degree on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and experienced professionals who possess the skills and experience necessary to deliver high quality services to our clients. Our objective of providing the highest quality of service to our clients is a significant consideration when we evaluate education, experience and qualifications of potential candidates for employment as direct care and administrative staff. To that end, we attempt to hire professionals and others with requisite educational backgrounds and professional certifications. These employees are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future.\nThe performance in each of our business segments also depends on the talents and efforts of our highly skilled intellectual technology professionals. Competition for skilled intellectual technology professionals can be intense. Our success depends on our ability to recruit, retain and motivate these individuals.\nOur ability to attract and retain employees with the requisite experience and skills depends on several factors including, but not limited to, our ability to offer competitive wages, benefits and professional growth opportunities. Some of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater financial, technical, political and marketing resources, name recognition and a larger number of clients and payers than we do. The inability to attract and retain experienced personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to manage growing and changing operations.\nSince 1996, our business has grown significantly in size and complexity, most recently with the acquisitions of Ingeus and Matrix in 2014. This growth has placed, and is expected to continue to place, significant demands on our management, systems, internal controls and financial and physical resources. In addition, we expect that we will need to further develop our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems to accommodate future growth. This could require us to incur significant expense for, among other things, hiring additional qualified personnel, retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems and expanding our information technology infrastructure. The nature of our business is such that qualified management personnel can be difficult to find. Our inability to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur success depends on our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace.\nWe compete for clients and for contracts with a variety of organizations that offer similar services across all of our segments. Many organizations of varying sizes compete with us, including local not-for-profit organizations and community based organizations, larger companies, organizations that provide similar NET management services to Medicaid eligible beneficiaries in local markets, large multi-national corporations that provide WD services and CHA providers. Some of these companies have greater financial, technical, political, marketing, name recognition and other resources and a larger number of clients or payers than we do. In addition, some of these companies offer more services than we do. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition from new entrants into the markets in which we operate. Increased competition may result in pricing pressures, loss of or failure to gain market share or loss of clients or payers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur business could be subject to security breaches and attacks.\nWe provide services to individuals, including services that require us to maintain sensitive and personal client information, including information relating to their health, social security numbers and other identifying data. Therefore, our information technology systems store client information protected by numerous federal, state and foreign regulations. Further, our systems include interfaces to third-party stakeholders, often connected via the Internet. As a result of the data we maintain and third-party access, we are subject to increasing cyber security risks. The nature of our business, where services are often performed outside a secured location, adds additional risk. While we have implemented measures to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks, our measures may not be effective. Criminals are constantly devising schemes to circumvent information technology security safeguards, and other companies have recently suffered serious data security breaches. If unauthorized parties gain access to our networks or databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify our private and sensitive third-party information, including personal identification information. In addition, employees may intentionally or inadvertently cause data or security breaches that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information.\nOur WD Services segment has operations in many countries in Europe and these operations have access to significant amounts of sensitive personal information about individuals. In Europe, these operations are subject to European and national data privacy legislation, which imposes significant obligations on data processors and controllers with respect to such personal information. Similar regimes exist in other WD Service jurisdictions such as Australia, Canada and South Korea. In addition, our contractual obligations with customers can require additional, stringent commitments in the handling of such information, which are subject to client audit procedures and other checks, often with severe contractual penalties in the case of breach.\nAs a result of any security breach, or loss or mishandling of data, we could incur liability, regulatory actions, fines, contractual deductions, enforcement orders or litigation, which could increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Further, any such breach, or loss or mishandling of data could impact our business reputation and could result in the loss of contractual relationships or make it more difficult to obtain new contracts, having an adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nWe depend on our key personnel.\nOur future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled individuals, with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success. Competition for well-qualified employees across Providence and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends, in part, upon our ability to attract new employees. While we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees, particularly our senior management, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our senior management or any other key employees in the future. Effective succession planning is also important to our future success. If we fail to ensure the effective transfer of senior management knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management across our various businesses, our ability to execute short and long term strategic, financial and operating goals, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations generally, could be adversely affected.\nRegulatory Risks\nWe conduct business in a heavily regulated healthcare industry. Compliance with existing regulations is costly, and changes in regulations or violations of regulations may result in increased costs or sanctions that could reduce our revenue and profitability.\nThe healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulations relating to, among other things:\n\u25cf\nprofessional licensure;\n\u25cf\nconduct of operations;\n\u25cf\naddition of facilities, equipment and services, including certificates of need;\n\u25cf\ncoding and billing for services; and\n\u25cf\npayment for services.\nBoth federal and state government agencies have increased coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts related to the healthcare industry. Regulations related to the healthcare industry are extremely complex and, in many instances, the industry does not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of those laws. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has also introduced some degree of regulatory uncertainty as the industry does not know how the changes it introduces will affect many aspects of the industry. Medicare and Medicaid anti-fraud and abuse laws prohibit certain business practices and relationships related to items and services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental healthcare programs, including the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce or arrange for referral of patients or recommendation for the provision of items or services covered by Medicare or Medicaid or any other federal or state healthcare program. Federal and state laws prohibit the submission of false or fraudulent claims, including claims to obtain reimbursement under Medicare and Medicaid. We have implemented compliance policies to help assure our compliance with these regulations as they become effective; however, different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations in the future could subject our practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services or the manner in which we conduct our business.\nOur HA Services segment operates in a heavily regulated healthcare industry, and changes to the regulatory landscape could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe CHA services industry is primarily regulated by federal and state healthcare laws and the requirements of participation and reimbursement of the MA Program established by CMS. From time to time, CMS considers changes to regulatory guidelines with respect to prospective CHAs. CMS could adopt new guidelines that may, for example, increase the costs associated with CHAs or limit the opportunities and settings available to administer CHAs. Further, changes in or adoption of new state laws governing the scope of practice of mid-level practitioners, or more restrictive interpretations of such laws, may restrict our ability to provide services using nurse practitioners. Any such implementation of additional regulations on the CHA industry by CMS or other regulatory bodies or further regulation of mid-level practitioners could have a material adverse impact on our HA Services segment\u2019s revenues and margins, which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations.\nIn our WD Services segment, we conduct business in several countries, each with its own system of regulation. Compliance with existing regulations is costly, and changes in regulations or violations of regulations may result in increased costs or sanctions that could reduce our revenue and profitability.\nIn 2015, our WD Services segment operated in 11 countries outside the US. Each of these countries has its own national and municipal laws and regulations, and some countries such as Australia, Germany and Switzerland, have both federal and state regulations. These laws can differ significantly from country to country. In addition, in Europe, countries (including the United Kingdom) are subject to European Union laws and rules. We have implemented compliance policies to help assure our compliance with these laws and regulations as they become effective; however, different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations in the future could subject our practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services or the manner in which we conduct our business.\nWe could be subject to actions for false claims if we do not comply with government coding and billing rules, which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nIf we fail to comply with federal and state documentation, coding and billing rules, we could be subject to criminal and/or civil penalties, loss of licenses and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. In billing for our services to third-party payers, we must follow complex documentation, coding and billing rules. These rules are based on federal and state laws, rules and regulations, various government pronouncements, and industry practice. Failure to follow these rules could result in potential criminal or civil liability under the federal False Claims Act, under which extensive financial penalties can be imposed and/or under various state statutes which prohibit the submission of false claims for services covered. Compliance failure could further result in criminal liability under various federal and state criminal or civil statutes.\nIn the WD Services segment, particularly in Europe, our contracts are subject to stringent claims and invoice processing regimes which vary depending on the customer and nature of the payment mechanism. Under European procurement legislation which has been implemented in each European Union member state, any conviction for fraud can result in a ban from participating in public procurement tenders for up to five years, or until the organization in question has put in place \u201cself clean\u201d measures to the satisfaction of the procuring authority. This could significantly affect our business given that most of our customers in Europe are governmental organizations. Any such breaches or deficiencies in paperwork associated with billing may also be subject to contractual claw back regimes and penalties, which can be enforced many years after the revenue has been paid by the relevant authority.\nWhile we carefully and regularly review our documentation, coding and billing practices, the rules are frequently vague and confusing and we cannot assure that governmental investigators, private insurers or private whistleblowers will not challenge our practices. Such a challenge could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties, loss of licenses and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for referring, ordering, leasing, purchasing or arranging for or recommending the ordering, purchasing or leasing of items or services payable by a federally funded healthcare program. Any of our financial relationships with healthcare providers will be potentially implicated by this statute to the extent Medicare or Medicaid referrals are implicated. Violations of the Anti-kickback Statute could result in substantial civil or criminal penalties, including criminal fines of up to $25,000 per violation, imprisonment of up to five years, civil penalties under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7a) of up to $50,000 per violation, plus three times the remuneration involved, civil penalties under the False Claims Act of up to $11,000 for each claim submitted, plus three times the amounts paid for such claims and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Any such penalties could have a significant negative effect on our operations. Furthermore, the exclusion, if applied to us, could result in significant reductions in our revenues, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of our operations. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute with similar penalties.\nIf we fail to comply with physician self-referral laws, to the extent applicable to our operations, we could experience a significant loss of reimbursement revenue.\nWe may be subject to federal and state statutes and regulations banning payments for referrals of patients and referrals by physicians to healthcare providers with whom the physicians have a financial relationship and billing for services provided pursuant to such referrals if any occur. Violation of these federal and state laws and regulations, to the extent applicable to our operations, may result in prohibition of payment for services rendered, loss of licenses, fines, criminal penalties and exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs. To the extent we do maintain such financial relationships with physicians, we rely on certain exceptions to self-referral laws that we believe will be applicable to such arrangements. Any failure to comply with such exceptions could result in the penalties discussed above.\nOur WD Services segment operates internationally, which exposes the group to risks of bribery, corruption and collusive tendering practices with respect to public officials and tenders.\nAs an international business whose customers are largely in the public sector, the WD Services segment generally wins work through public tender processes. Various statutes, such as the UK\u2019s Bribery Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the US, prohibit us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. These statutes require us to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect our transactions. In addition, many countries in which we operate have antitrust or competition regulations which prohibit collusive tendering or bid-rigging behavior. Policies and procedures we implement to prevent bribery, corruption and anti-competitive conduct may not effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, our WD Services segment is subject to the European Union\u2019s and other countries\u2019 data security and protection laws and regulations. These laws and regulations may restrict the flow of information, including information about employees or service users, from this segment to the Company in the US. In certain instances, informed consent to the data transfer must be given by the affected employee or service user. Compliance with such laws and regulations may make it more difficult for the Company to maintain the records and internal accounting practices necessary to ensure the appropriate operation of our internal controls or to detect corruption. Any breach of bribery, corruption and collusive tendering laws could also expose our operations in Europe to a ban from participating in public procurement tenders for up to 5 years, or until the organization in question has put in place \u201cself clean\u201d measures to the satisfaction of the procuring authority.\nWe are subject to regulations relating to privacy and security of patient information. Failure to comply with privacy regulations could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nThere are numerous federal and state regulations addressing patient information privacy and security concerns. In particular, the federal regulations issued under (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) contain provisions that:\n\u25cf\nprotect individual privacy by limiting the uses and disclosures of patient information;\n\u25cf\nrequire the implementation of security safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form; and\n\u25cf\nprescribe specific transaction formats and data code sets for certain electronic healthcare transactions.\nCompliance with state and federal laws and regulations is costly and requires our management to expend substantial time and resources. Further, the HIPAA regulations and state privacy laws expose us to increased regulatory risk, as the penalties associated with a failure to comply, even if unintentional, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have an internal committee to maintain our privacy and security policies regarding client information in compliance with HIPAA. This committee is responsible for training our employees, including our regional and local managers and staff, to comply with HIPAA and monitoring compliance with the policy. The costs associated with our ongoing compliance could be substantial, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur WD Services segment has operations in many countries in Europe, and internationally, and these operations have access to significant amounts of sensitive personal information about individuals. In Europe, these operations are subject to European and national data privacy legislation which imposes significant obligations on data processors and controllers with respect to such personal information. Some countries, such as France and Germany, have particularly strong privacy laws which impose even greater obligations on people handling personal information. There are proposed amendments being suggested to European data privacy legislation which could significantly increase the fines for any breaches. In addition to fining powers, information privacy regulators in Europe have significant powers to require organizations that breach regulations to put in place measures to ensure that such breaches do not occur again, and require businesses to stop processing personal information until the required measures are in place. Such orders could significantly impact our business given we are required to handle personal information as part of our service delivery model.\nAs a government contractor, we are subject to an increased risk of litigation and other legal actions and liabilities.\nAs a government contractor, we are subject to an increased risk of investigation, criminal prosecution, civil fraud, whistleblower lawsuits and other legal actions and liabilities that are not as frequently experienced by companies that do not provide government sponsored services. Companies providing government sponsored services can also become involved in public inquiries which can lead to negative media speculation or potential cancellation or termination of contracts. In our WD Services segment in Europe, European procurement regulations in force in each European Union member state require public procurement authorities to impose a ban from participating in public procurement tenders for up to five years, or until the organization in question has put in place \u201cself clean\u201d measures to the satisfaction of the procuring authority where companies are found guilty of fraud or certain other criminal offenses. Authorities can also exercise their discretion to blacklist companies for up to two years where they believe they have been involved in acts of gross misconduct or until the organization in question has put in place \u201cself clean\u201d measures to the satisfaction of the procuring authority. The occurrence of any of these actions, regardless of the outcome, could disrupt our operations and result in increased costs, and could limit our ability to obtain additional contracts in other jurisdictions.\nOur business could be adversely affected by future legislative changes that hinder or reverse the privatization of NET services or WD services.\nThe market for certain of our services depends largely on government sponsored programs. These programs can be modified or amended at any time. Moreover, part of our growth strategy includes aggressively pursuing opportunities created by government initiatives to privatize the delivery of NET services and WD services. However, there are opponents to the privatization of these services and, as a result, future privatization is uncertain. If additional privatization initiatives are not proposed or enacted, or if previously enacted privatization initiatives are challenged, repealed or invalidated, there could be a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nOur business is subject to licensing regulations and other regulatory provisions, including regulatory provisions governing surveys and audits. Changes to, or violations of, these regulations could negatively impact our revenues.\nIn many of the locations where we operate, we are required by local laws (both US and foreign) to obtain and maintain licenses. The applicable state and local licensing requirements govern the services we provide, the credentials of staff, record keeping, treatment planning, client monitoring and supervision of staff. The failure to maintain these licenses or the loss of a license could have a material adverse impact on our business and could prevent us from providing services to clients in a given jurisdiction. Most of our contracts are subject to surveys or audit by our payers. We are also subject to regulations that restrict our ability to contract directly with a government agency in certain situations. Such restrictions could affect our ability to contract with certain payers, and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nFinancial Risks\nChanges in budgetary priorities of the government entities that fund the services we provide could result in our loss of contracts or a decrease in amounts payable to us under our contracts.\nOur revenue is largely derived from contracts that are directly or indirectly paid or funded by government agencies. All of these contracts are subject to legislative appropriations and state or national budget approval. The availability of funding under our contracts with state governments is dependent in part upon federal funding to states. Changes in Medicaid methodology may further reduce the availability of federal funds to states in which we provide services. Among the alternative Medicaid funding approaches that states have explored are provider assessments as tools for leveraging increased Medicaid federal matching funds. Provider assessment plans generate additional federal matching funds to the states for Medicaid reimbursement purposes, and implementation of a provider assessment plan requires approval by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in order to qualify for federal matching funds. These plans usually take the form of a bed tax or a quality assessment fee, which were historically required to be imposed uniformly across classes of providers within the state, except that such taxes only applied to Medicaid health plans.\nHowever, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (\u201cDeficit Reduction Act\u201d) requires states that desire to impose provider taxes to impose taxes on all MCOs, not just Medicaid MCOs. This uniformity requirement as it relates to taxing all MCOs may make states more reluctant to use provider assessments as a vehicle for raising matching funds and, thus, reduce the amount of funding that the states receive and have available. Moreover, under the Deficit Reduction Act, states may be allowed to reduce the benefits provided to certain Medicaid enrollees, which could affect the services that states contract for with us. We cannot make any assurances that these Medicaid changes will not negatively affect the funding under our contracts. As funding under our contracts is dependent in part upon federal funding, such funding changes could have a significant effect upon our business.\nCurrently, many of the US states and overseas countries in which we operate are facing budgetary shortfalls or changes in budgetary priorities. While many of these states are dealing with budgetary concerns by shifting costs from institutional care to home and community based care such as we provide, there is no assurance that this trend will continue.\nLikewise, in many of the overseas countries addressed by our WD Services segment, a continued focus on austerity measures following the global financial crisis to reduce national and local budget deficits could lead to further spending cuts or changes to welfare arrangements. This may make availability of funding for outsourcing of such services more difficult to obtain from relevant government departments, which may lead to more challenging terms and conditions including pressure on prices or volumes of services provided.\nConsequently, a significant decline in government expenditures, shift of expenditures or funding away from programs that call for the types of services that we provide, or change in government contracting or funding policies could cause payers to terminate their contracts with us or reduce their expenditures under those contracts, either of which could have a negative impact on our operating results.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenues from a few payers, which puts us at risk. Any changes in the funding, financial viability or our relationships with these payers could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe generate a significant amount of the revenues in our segments from a few payers under a small number of contracts. For example, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we generated approximately 52.8%, 56.2% and 61.8%, respectively, of our revenue from our top ten payers. Additionally, our top five payers related to our NET Services operating segment represent, in the aggregate, approximately 39.2%, 43.2% and 43.6%, respectively, of our NET Services operating segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The top payer related to our WD Services operating segment represented 40.0% and 57.2% of our WD Services operating segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and the period from May 31, 2014 to December 31, 2014, respectively. Additionally, the top payer related to our HA Services operating segment represented 31.1% and 43.2% of our HA Services operating segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the period from October 24, 2014 to December 31, 2014, respectively. The loss of, reduction in amounts generated by, or changes in methods or regulations governing payments for our services under these contracts could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and results of operations.\nChanges to the fee structure in our workforce development contracts with the UK Department of Work & Pension could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nApproximately 40.0% and 57.2% of WD Services\u2019 revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the period from May 31, 2014 to December 31, 2014, respectively, are derived from seven standardized regional contracts with the Department of Work & Pension (\u201cDWP\u201d) under the Work Programme, whereby services are provided to long-term unemployed individuals to place them into jobs. Under the terms of the contracts with the DWP, effective July 1, 2014, the fee structure has changed, eliminating certain upfront payments and discounting certain other fees. As a result, going forward, WD Services will receive the majority of its revenue under these contracts only upon demonstrating the client\u2019s continued employment for a substantial period of time and upon achievement of incentive measures over the defined measurement periods. However, a substantial portion of the total cost of providing services to clients is incurred in the period between referral and job placement. The loss of, continued reduction in amounts generated by, or changes in methods or regulations governing payments for our services under these contracts with the DWP could have a material adverse impact on our WD Services segment\u2019s revenue and margins, which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations.\nOur contracts in certain of our segments can be terminated prior to expiration, without cause and without penalty to the payers. There can be no assurance that out contracts will survive until the end of their stated terms, or that upon their expiration these contracts will be renewed or extended. Disruptions to our contracts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWith respect to many of our contracts, the payer may terminate the contract without cause, at will and without penalty to the payer, either immediately or upon the expiration of a short notice period in the event that, among other reasons, government appropriations supporting the programs serviced by the contract are reduced or eliminated. The failure of payers to renew or extend significant contracts or their early termination of significant contracts could adversely affect our financial performance. We cannot anticipate if, when or to what extent a payer might terminate its contract with us prior to its expiration or fail to renew or extend its contract with us.\nOur contracts are subject to audit and modification by the payers with whom we contract, at their sole discretion.\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully perform under various government funded contracts. Under the terms of these contracts, payers can review our performance, as well as our records and general business practices at any time, and may, in their discretion:\n\u2022\nsuspend or prevent us from receiving new contracts or extending existing contracts because of violations or suspected violations of procurement laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nterminate or modify our existing contracts;\n\u2022\nreduce the amount we are paid under our existing contracts; and/or\n\u2022\naudit and object to our contract related fees.\nIf payers have significant audit findings, or if they make material modifications to our contracts, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nIf we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations, we could be liable for damages and financial penalties, which may place existing pledged performance and payment bonds at risk as well as harm our ability to keep our existing contracts or obtain new contracts and future bonds.\nOur failure to comply with our contract obligations could, in addition to providing grounds for immediate termination of the contract for cause, negatively impact our financial performance and damage our reputation, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain current contracts or obtain new ones. Our failure to meet contractual obligations could also result in substantial actual and consequential financial damages. The termination of a contract for cause could, for instance, subject us to liabilities for excess costs incurred by a payer in obtaining similar services from another source. In addition, our contracts require us to indemnify payers for our failure to meet standards of care, and some of them contain liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties that we must pay if we breach these contracts.\nIf we fail to estimate accurately the cost of performing certain contracts, we may experience reduced or negative margins.\nApproximately 83.6%, 84.1% and 83.4% of our NET services revenue during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, was generated under capitated contracts with the remainder generated through fee for service (\u201cFFS\u201d) and flat fee contracts. Our WD Services segment also provides services under FFS and flat fee contracts. Under most of our capitated contracts, we assume the responsibility of managing the needs of a specific geographic population by contracting out transportation services to local van, cab and ambulance companies on a per ride or per mile basis. We use a \u201cpricing model\u201d to determine applicable contract rates, which takes into account factors, such as estimated utilization, state specific data, previous experience in the state and/or with similar services, medical covered programs outlined, identified populations to be serviced, estimated volume and availability of mass transit. The amount of the fixed per member, per month fee is determined in the bidding process, but predicated on actual historical transportation data for the subject geographic region (provided by the payer), actuarial work performed in-house as well as by third party actuarial firms and actuarial analyses provided by the payer. If the utilization of our services is more than we estimated, the contract may be less profitable than anticipated, or may not be profitable at all. Under our FFS contracts, we receive fees based on our interactions with government sponsored clients. To earn a profit on these contracts, we must accurately estimate costs incurred in providing services. Our risk on these contracts is that our client population is not large enough to cover our fixed costs, such as rent and overhead. Our FFS contracts are not reimbursed on a cost basis and therefore, if we fail to estimate our costs accurately, we may experience reduced margins, or even losses on these contracts.\nOur results of operations will continue to fluctuate due to seasonality.\nOur quarterly operating results and operating cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business. Our NET Services operating segment experiences fluctuations in demand for its non-emergency transportation services during the summer, winter and holiday seasons. Due to higher demand in the summer months and lower demand in the winter and holiday seasons, coupled with a primarily fixed revenue stream based on a per member, per month payment structure, our NET Services operating segment normally experiences lower operating margins in the summer season and higher operating margins in the winter and holiday seasons. Our HA and WD Services operating segments typically do not experience seasonal fluctuations in operating results, however, quarterly volatility in revenue and earnings is common due to uneven customer demand in our HA Services segment and the timing of commencement and expiration of certain major contracts in our WD Services segment.\nOur reported financial results could suffer if there is an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets.\nGoodwill may be impaired if the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units is less than the carrying value of the respective reporting unit. Because we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets. We perform an analysis on our goodwill balances to test for impairment on an annual basis. Similarly, interim impairment tests may also be required in advance of our annual impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value, including goodwill, of one or more of our reporting units below the reporting unit\u2019s carrying value. Such circumstances could include but are not limited to: (1) loss of significant contracts, (2) a significant adverse change in legal factors, government regulations, or in the climate of our business, (3) unanticipated competition, (4) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, or (5) a significant decline in our stock price. If events occur or circumstances change, we may be required to record an impairment adjustment to our goodwill or other intangible assets which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe may incur costs before receiving related revenues, which could result in cash shortfalls.\nWhen we are awarded a contract to provide services, we may incur expenses before we receive any contract payments. These expenses include leasing office space, purchasing office equipment, instituting information technology systems, and hiring personnel. As a result, in certain large contracts where the government does not fund program start-up costs, we may be required to invest significant sums of money before receiving any related contract payments or sufficient payments needed to cover start-up costs. In addition, payments due to us from payers may be delayed due to billing cycles or as a result of failures to approve government budgets in a timely manner. Moreover, especially under FFS arrangements, any resulting cash shortfall could be exacerbated if we fail to either invoice the payer or to collect our fee in a timely manner. This could have a material adverse impact on our ongoing operations and our financial position.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt, which could impair our financial condition.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $305.0 million of total indebtedness and approximately $212.1 million of available letter of credit and borrowing capacity under our credit facilities. Our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness could have other important consequences on our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or acquisitions and other purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce the funds available to us for other purposes;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions, as well as in government regulation and to our business;\n\u2022\nexpose us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because some of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expenses in the event of increases in interest rates; and\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations.\nOur ability to satisfy and manage our debt obligations depends on our ability to generate cash flow and on overall financial market conditions. To some extent, this is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to permit us to pay principal, premium, if any, or interest on our debt obligations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations and meet our other cash needs, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell or curtail assets or operations, seek additional capital, or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. If we must sell or curtail our assets or operations, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue.\nIn addition, on February 11, 2015 and March 12, 2015, we issued $65.5 million and $15.8 million, respectively, of convertible preferred stock. The terms of the convertible preferred stock require us to pay mandatory quarterly dividends, either in cash or through an increase in the stated principal value of such stock. Our ability to satisfy and manage our obligations under our outstanding preferred stock depends, in part, on our ability to generate cash flow and on overall financial market conditions and the other factors discussed above.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to fund our day-to-day operations or to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nOur credit facility restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nOur variable-rate indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our credit facility are subject to variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable-rate indebtedness would increase and our net income would decrease, even though the amount borrowed under the facilities remained the same. As of December 31, 2015, we had $305.0 million outstanding variable-rate borrowings under our credit facility. Borrowings under our credit facilities accrue interest at LIBOR plus 3.0% per annum as of December 31, 2015. An increase of 1% in the LIBOR rate would cause an increase in interest expense of approximately $6.8 million over the remaining term of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which matures in 2018.\nRestrictive covenants in our credit facility may limit our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to pursue our business strategies.\nThe terms contained in the agreements that govern certain of our indebtedness, and the agreements that govern any future indebtedness of ours may include, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to take actions that we believe may be in our best interest. These agreements, among other things, limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\nprovide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;\n\u2022\nissue redeemable stock and preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake loans, investments and capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u2022\nmake distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nsell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nmake acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person.\nA breach of the covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the applicable indebtedness. Such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In the event our lenders and note holders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we cannot assure that we and our subsidiaries would have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness.\nOur use of a reinsurance program to cover certain claims for losses suffered and costs or expenses incurred could negatively impact our business.\nWe reinsure a substantial portion of our automobile, general liability, professional liability and workers\u2019 compensation insurance. We also reinsured the general liability, professional liability, workers\u2019 compensation insurance, automobile liability and automobile physical damage of various members of the network of subcontracted transportation providers and independent third parties over various policy years under reinsurance programs through our two wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries. However, effective February 15, 2011, we did not renew our reinsurance agreement and do not assume liabilities for policies that cover the general liability, automobile liability, and automobile physical damage coverage of our independent third party transportation providers after that date. We will continue to administer existing policies for the foreseeable future and resolve remaining and future claims related to these policies. In the event that actual reinsured losses increase unexpectedly and substantially exceed actuarially determined estimated reinsured losses under the program, the aggregate of such losses could materially increase our liability and adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and results of operations. In addition, as the availability to us of certain traditional insurance coverage diminishes or increases in cost, we will continue to evaluate the levels and types of insurance we include in our reinsurance and self-insurance programs. Any increase to these programs increases our risk exposure and therefore increases the risk of a possible material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and results of operations.\nAny acquisition that we undertake could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nWe have made, and anticipate that we will continue to make, strategic acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. We have made a number of acquisitions since our inception. The success of these and other acquisitions depends in part on our ability to integrate acquired companies into our business operations. There can be no assurance that the companies acquired will continue to generate income at the historical levels on which we based our acquisition decisions, that we will be able to maintain or renew the acquired companies\u2019 contracts, that we will be able to realize operating and economic efficiencies upon integration of acquired companies, or that the acquisitions will not adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe continually review opportunities to acquire other businesses that would complement our current services, expand our markets or otherwise offer prospects for growth. In connection with our acquisition strategy, we could issue stock that would dilute existing stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership, or we could incur or assume substantial debt or contingent liabilities. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nchallenges assimilating the acquired operations;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs and known and unknown legal or financial liabilities associated with an acquisition;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from our core businesses;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with customers;\n\u2022\nentering markets in which we have limited or no experience;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees of purchased organizations;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of excessive leverage in financing an acquisition;\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain and renew contracts of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with litigation or other claims arising in connection with the acquired company;\n\u2022\nunanticipated operating, accounting or management difficulties in connection with an acquisition; and\n\u2022\ndilution to our earnings per share.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming problems encountered in connection with any acquisition and our inability to do so could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business. Moreover, we rely heavily on the representations and warranties and related indemnities provided to us by the sellers of acquired companies, including as they relate to creation, ownership and rights in intellectual property and compliance with laws and contractual requirements. Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally.\nContract profitability may decline due to actions by governmental agencies.\nIn our WD Services segment, our operating costs and profitability may be significantly impacted by actions required by a government agency, such as the availability of information systems maintained by the government to streamline enrollment into our service programs. In addition, certain contracts may require that we hire former government employees, in relation to offering our service programs. Lastly, revenue under certain contracts may be adjusted prospectively if client volumes are below expectations. If the Company is unable to adjust its costs accordingly, profitability is negatively impacted.\nOur estimated income taxes could be materially different from income taxes that we ultimately pay.\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the US and numerous jurisdictions abroad. Significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our provision for income taxes and related matters. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determinations are uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation. Our determination of our income tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities and we are currently subject to audits in a number of jurisdictions. Although we believe our income tax estimates and related determinations are reasonable and appropriate, relevant taxing authorities may disagree. The ultimate outcome of any such audits and reviews could be materially different from estimates and determinations reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant commercial arrangements could result in operating and financial difficulties.\nIn 2014 we entered into a joint venture in order to bid on a new contract. Our future growth may depend, in part, on future similar arrangements, any of which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. The success of these arrangements will depend in part on the satisfactory performance of contractual obligations by our partners, over which we will not have control. Further, challenges may arise relating to such arrangements, such as governance, accountability and decision-making conflicts, which may be costly to resolve or may make the arrangement less successful.\nInternational Risks\nThere are risks associated with our international operations that are different from the risks associated with our operations in the US, and our exposure to the risks of a global market could hinder our ability to maintain and expand international operations.\nWe have operation centers in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the US. In implementing our international strategy, we may face barriers to entry and competition from local companies and other companies that already have established global businesses, as well as the risks generally associated with conducting business internationally. The success and profitability of international operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, such as:\n\u2022\npolitical or economic instability;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulation or taxation;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange fluctuations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing operations in certain foreign countries;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages or other changes in labor conditions; and\n\u2022\ntaxes and other restrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the US.\nIn addition, changes in policies and/or laws of the US or foreign governments resulting in, among other changes, higher taxation, tariffs or similar protectionist laws could reduce the anticipated benefits of international operations and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We have currency exposure arising from both sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies, including intercompany transactions outside the US, and we currently do not conduct hedging activities. We cannot predict with precision the effect of future exchange-rate fluctuations on our business and operating results, and significant rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate and are in a taxable income position in multiple tax jurisdictions, and face the risk of double taxation if one jurisdiction does not acquiesce to the tax claims of another jurisdiction.\nWe currently operate in the US and 11 foreign countries and are subject to income taxes in those countries and the specific states and/or provinces where we operate. In the event one taxing jurisdiction disagrees with another taxing jurisdiction, we could experience temporary or permanent double taxation and increased professional fees to resolve taxation matters.\nOur revenues and expenses are subject to foreign economic and currency risks due to our operations outside of the US.\nWe have operations in 11 countries outside the US. The value of the US dollar against other foreign currencies has seen significant volatility recently. Our reported financial condition and results of operations are reported in multiple currencies, and are then translated into US dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Appreciation of the US dollar against these other currencies will have a negative impact on our reported net revenue and operating income while depreciation of the US dollar against such currencies will have a positive effect on reported net revenue and operating income.", "PERMNO": 89824, "SIC": 4100, "TIC": "PRSC"}
