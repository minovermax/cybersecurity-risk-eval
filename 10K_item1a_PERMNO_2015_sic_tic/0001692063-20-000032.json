RISK FACTORS\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain statements regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial performance, future action, results, and any other statements that do not directly relate to any historical or current fact which are \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), the Exchange Act, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Where, in any forward-looking statement, an expectation or belief as to future results or events is expressed, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of management and expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will be achieved or accomplished. Many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated include those matters described under the sections entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that we may make or persons acting on our behalf may issue.\nYou should consider each of the following factors, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes, in evaluating our business and our prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. In general, we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other companies such as general economic, industry, and/or market conditions and growth rates; possible future terrorist threats or armed conflicts and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks occur, our business and financial results could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry, and Strategy\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions.\nOur business and results of operations are sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact customer shipping volumes, industry freight demand, industry truck capacity, and our operating costs. We cannot predict future economic conditions, fuel price fluctuations, revenue equipment resale values, or how consumer confidence could be affected by such conditions. Economic conditions that decrease shipping demand, including but not limited to public health crises or outbreaks\nof an infectious disease, or increase the supply of capacity in the North American transportation and logistics industry can exert downward pressure on rates and equipment utilization. In general, a significant decline in shipping volumes within the industry or increases in available truck capacity results in more aggressive freight pricing as carriers compete for loads and to maintain truck productivity. Likewise, we are also subject to cost increases outside our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to offset such increases either through rate increases or cost reductions. Such cost increases include, but are not limited to, driver wages, fuel and energy prices, taxes and interest rates, tolls, license and registration fees, insurance premiums, regulations, revenue equipment and related maintenance costs, and healthcare and other employee benefit costs. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any such cost increases could occur. Any such cost increase or event could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry that is characterized by intense price competition which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nCompetition for the freight we transport or manage is based primarily on service, efficiency, available capacity, and to some degree, on freight rates alone. In addition, some of our customers may use or expand their own private fleets rather than outsourcing loads to us. Our operating segments compete with many other truckload carriers, logistics, brokerage and transportation service providers of varying sizes, and to a lesser extent, LTL carriers, railroads, and other transportation or logistics companies, some of which have a larger fleet, greater access to equipment, preferential customer contracts, greater capital resources, or other competitive advantages. Our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business, especially when economic conditions are present which negatively impact customer shipping volumes, truck capacities, or operating costs. Moreover, to limit the number of approved carriers to a manageable number, some of our customers select \u201ccore carriers\u201d as approved transportation service providers, and in some instances or periods of time, we may not be selected. Other of our customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, which also periodically results in the loss of business to competitors. These competitive dynamics could have an adverse effect on the number of shipments we transport and the freight rates we receive, which could limit our growth opportunities and reduce our profitability.\nWell-resourced, non-traditional competitors have entered our industry and markets who appear to be willing to operate at little or no margin in order to gain market share which, individually or collectively, could cause us to lower our pricing and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur industry has experienced market entrance by well-resourced, nontraditional firms or startups who, in some cases, have undercut market prices via digital brokerage platforms to take market share in the fragmented North American transportation and logistics industry.\nOur competitors may also introduce or adopt new brokerage platforms or technologies, which could increase competitive pressures. Although we believe we are well positioned and have adopted technologies, developed strategies, and heavily invested in our own digital service offerings to compete with or supplant these new market entrants, there can be no assurance that our investments, technologies, or strategies will be successful.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from our major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nWe strive to maintain a diverse customer base however, a significant portion of our operating revenues are generated from a number of major customers, the loss of one or more of which could, in any given quarter, have a materially adverse effect on our business. Refer to Part I, Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d for information regarding our customer concentrations. Aside from our dedicated operations, we generally do not have long-term contractual relationships or rate agreements or minimum volume guarantees with our customers. Furthermore, certain of the long-term contracts in our dedicated operations are subject to cancellation. There is no assurance any of our customers, including our dedicated customers, will continue to utilize our services, renew our existing contracts, or continue at the same volume levels. Despite the existence of contractual arrangements, certain of our customers may nonetheless engage in competitive bidding processes that could negatively impact our contractual relationship. In addition, certain of our major customers may increasingly use their own truckload and delivery fleets, which would reduce our freight volumes. A reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers, including our dedicated customers, could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDifficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers could materially, adversely affect our profitability and ability to maintain or grow our fleet.\nLike many truckload carriers, we experience difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified drivers, both new and experienced, including independent contractors who operate as \u201cowner-operator\u201d drivers, and such shortages could require us to significantly increase driver compensation, rely more on higher-cost third-party carriers, idle revenue equipment, or dispose of the equipment altogether, any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability. Our challenge with attracting and retaining qualified drivers stems primarily from intense market competition for a limited pool of qualified drivers\nand our rigorous driver quality and safety standards which decrease the pool of qualified applicants available to us. Like most companies in our industry, we also suffer from a high turnover rate of new drivers, especially during their first 90 days of employment.\nOur turnover rate requires us to continually recruit a substantial number of company and owner-operator drivers in order to meet customer demand. Independent contractor availability is generally affected by operating cost increases (which are the responsibility of independent contractors) and generally favorable economic conditions, which drive overall increases in customer demand and heightened competition for owner-operators from other carriers. When shortages of owner-operators occur, we may be forced to increase the settlement rates paid to independent contractors and increase driver pay rates (for company drivers) to attract and retain a sufficient number of drivers. These increases could negatively affect our results of operations to the extent that we would be unable to obtain corresponding freight rate increases.\nWe rely significantly on our information technology systems, a disruption, failure, or security breach of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on information technology throughout all areas of our business and operations to receive, track, accept, and complete customer orders; process financial and non-financial data; compile results of operations for internal and external reporting; and achieve operating efficiencies and growth. Such data and information remain vulnerable to cyber-attacks, cyber security breaches, theft, or other unauthorized disclosure which, if successful, could result in the disclosure of confidential customer or commercial data, loss of valuable intellectual property, or system disruptions and subject us to civil liability and fines or penalties, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business, any of which could be material. In addition, delayed sales, lower margins, or lost customers resulting from security breaches or network disruptions could materially reduce our revenues, materially increase our expenses, damage our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nOur information technology systems may also be susceptible to interruptions or failures for a variety of reasons including software failure, user error, power outages, natural disasters, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, hackers, or other security breaches. A significant disruption or failure in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, which could include operational disruptions, loss of confidential information, external reporting delays or errors, legal claims, or damage to our business reputation.\nThe success of our businesses depends on our strong reputation and our ability to maintain the value of the Schneider brand.\nBecause the services that we market and sell under the Schneider brand generate essentially all of the Company\u2019s net revenues, the Schneider brand name is our most valuable sales and marketing tool. Press coverage, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, or other adverse publicity that assert some form of wrongdoing or that depict the Company or any of our executives, associates, contractors, or agents in a negative light, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, could tarnish our reputation and result in a loss of brand equity. If we do not maintain and protect our brand image and reputation, demand for our services could wain and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.\nIf fuel prices increase significantly, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur truckload operations are almost entirely dependent upon diesel fuel, and accordingly, significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to pass increased costs on to customers through rate increases or fuel surcharges. Prices and availability of petroleum products are subject to political, economic, geographic, weather-related, and market factors that are generally outside our control and each of which may lead to fluctuations in the cost of fuel.\nOur fuel surcharge program does not protect us against the full effect of increases in fuel prices, and the terms of our fuel surcharge agreements vary by customer. In addition, because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices, our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture the increased costs we pay for fuel, especially when prices are rising. During periods of low freight volumes, shippers can use their negotiating leverage to impose fuel surcharge policies that provide a lower reimbursement of our fuel costs.\nThere is no assurance that such fuel surcharges can be maintained indefinitely or will be sufficiently effective. Our results of operations would be negatively affected to the extent we cannot recover higher fuel costs or fail to improve our fuel price protection through our fuel surcharge program. Increases in fuel prices, or a shortage or rationing of diesel fuel, could also materially and adversely affect our results of operations. As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations.\nWe depend on railroads in the operation of our intermodal business, and therefore, our ability to offer intermodal services could be limited if we experience instability from third parties we use in that business.\nOur Intermodal segment utilizes railroads and some third-party drayage carriers to transport freight for our intermodal customers. The majority of these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads. While we have had agreements with all of the Class I railroads, currently, our primary contracts are with the BNSF Railway Company (\u201cBNSF\u201d) and CSX Transportation (\u201cCSX\u201d) freight railroads to provide rail-based freight transportation services in support of our intermodal operations. One of our competitors has a preferential contractual arrangement with BNSF, which limits the market share and relative profitability of the services we provide through BNSF. In certain markets and rail corridors, rail service is limited to a few railroads or even a single railroad due to the lack of competition. Our ability to provide intermodal services in certain traffic lanes is likely to be reduced or constricted if any of the Class 1 railroads were to discontinue service in those lanes or if the overall state of rail service in those lanes were to deteriorate.\nOur contracts with the railroads are subject to periodic renewal, and our intermodal business may be adversely affected by any adverse change in our contract terms with the railroads, our relationships with the railroads, or declines in service and volume levels provided by the railroads.\nIn addition, a portion of the freight we deliver through both our Intermodal and Trucking segments is imported to the U.S. through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts. Work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend on third-party capacity providers, and issues of performance, availability, or pricing with these transportation providers could increase our operating costs, reduce our ability to offer intermodal and brokerage services, and limit growth in our brokerage and logistics operations, which could adversely affect our revenue, results of operations, and customer relationships.\nOur Logistics segment is highly dependent on the services of third-party capacity providers, such as other truckload carriers, LTL carriers, railroads, ocean carriers, and airlines. Many of those providers face the same economic challenges as we do and, therefore, are actively and competitively soliciting business. These economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the performance, availability, and cost of third-party capacity. If we are unable to secure the services of these third-party capacity providers at reasonable rates, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees, and if we are unable to attract and retain such qualified employees, our business and our ability to execute our business strategies may be materially impaired.\nOur future success depends largely on the continued service and efforts of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to identify, attract, retain, and motivate them. Although we believe we have an experienced and highly qualified management team, the loss of the services of these key personnel could have a significant adverse impact on us and our future profitability. Additionally, we must continue to recruit, develop, and retain skilled and experienced operations, technology, and sales managers if we are to realize our goal of expanding our operations and continuing our growth. Failure to recruit, develop, and retain a core group of service center managers could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nHistorically, we have not made a significant number of acquisitions, and we may not make acquisitions in the future; if we do, the financial performance of the acquired company could fail to meet our expectations which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nHistorically, acquisitions have not been a significant part of our growth strategy. From 2008 to 2015 we did not complete any significant acquisitions. In 2016, we acquired WSL. We may not be successful in identifying, negotiating, or consummating any acquisitions, and we may not achieve the synergies and operating results anticipated in connection with these acquisitions.\nIn addition, any acquisitions we undertake could involve numerous risks that could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in realizing anticipated economic, operational, and other benefits in a timely manner that could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical, or financial problems;\n\u2022\nchallenges in achieving anticipated revenue, earnings, or cash flows;\n\u2022\nassumption of liabilities that may exceed our estimates or what was disclosed to us;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of customers, key associates, and drivers of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of additional indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nthe issuance of additional shares of our common stock, which would dilute shareholders' ownership in the company.\nIf we cannot effectively manage the challenges associated with doing business internationally, our revenues and profitability may suffer.\nOur results are affected by the success of our operations in Mexico, Canada, and China. We are subject to risks of doing business in those countries, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and currency controls, local economic and political conditions, restrictive trade policies, imposition of foreign duties, and taxes, U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws, U.S. and foreign trade policies, difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights, burdens of complying with a wide variety of international and U.S. export and import laws, and social, political, and economic instability. Additional risks associated with our foreign operations, including restrictive trade policies and imposition of duties, taxes, or government royalties by foreign governments, are present but largely mitigated by the terms of NAFTA for Mexico and Canada. The agreement permitting cross-border movements for both U.S. and Mexican based carriers into the U.S. and Mexico presents additional risks in the form of potential increased competition and the potential for increased congestion on the cross-border lanes between countries. On November 30, 2018, the U.S., Canada, and Mexico signed the USMCA as an overhaul and update to NAFTA. The USMCA has been ratified by Mexico and the U.S. and is pending ratification by Canada. Once ratified by Canada, it will go into effect 90 days later. It is difficult to anticipate the full impact of this agreement on our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to maintain our Customs Trade Partner Against Terrorism, Free and Secure Trade, and Partners in Protection status, we may have significant border delays. This could cause our Mexican and Canadian operations to be less efficient than those of our competitors.\nSevere weather and similar events could harm our results of operations or make our results more volatile.\nFrom time to time, we may suffer impacts from severe weather and similar events, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, and explosions. These events may disrupt freight shipments or routes, affect regional economies, destroy our assets, disrupt fuel supplies, increase fuel costs, cause lost revenue and productivity, increase our maintenance costs, or adversely affect the business or financial condition of our customers, any of which could harm our results of operations or make our results of operations more volatile.\nWe are subject to various claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business which could adversely affect us.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including those related to accidents involving our trucks, cargo claims, commercial disputes, property damage, and environmental liability, which may not be covered by our insurance. Such proceedings include claims by third parties, and certain proceedings have been certified or purport to be class actions. In appropriate cases, we have taken and will seek subrogation from third parties who are responsible for losses or damages that we may pay to claimants. The costs of defending or maintaining such legal proceedings, particularly class-action litigation, may be substantial and, in any period, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nOur goodwill or long-lived assets may become impaired, which could result in a significant charge to earnings.\nWe hold significant amounts of goodwill and long-lived assets, and the balances of these assets could increase in the future if we acquire other businesses. At December 31, 2019, the balance of our goodwill, internal use software, and long-lived assets was $2.0 billion, and the total market value of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares was $3.9 billion. Under GAAP, we review our goodwill, other intangible assets, and long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such goodwill, other intangible assets, or long-lived assets may not be recoverable. In addition, we test goodwill for impairment annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill, other intangible assets, or long-lived assets may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, a sustained decline in stock price and market capitalization, significant negative variances between actual and expected financial results, reduced future cash flow estimates, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations or legal proceedings, failure to realize anticipated synergies from acquisitions, and slower growth rates in our industry. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill, other intangible assets, or long-lived assets is determined to exist, negatively impacting our results of operations. If our market capitalization was to fall below the book value of our total stockholders\u2019 equity for a sustained period, we may conclude that the fair value of certain of our intangible or long-lived assets is materially impaired. In this case, we would be required under GAAP to record a noncash charge to our earnings which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe have significant ongoing capital requirements that could affect our profitability if our capital investments do not match customer demand for invested resources, or we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations.\nOur operations are capital-intensive, and our strategic decision to invest in newer equipment requires us to expend significant amounts in capital expenditures annually. The amount and timing of such capital expenditures depend on various factors, including anticipated freight demand and the price and availability of new or used tractors. If anticipated demand differs\nmaterially from actual usage, our capital-intensive truckload operations may have too many or too few assets. Moreover, resource requirements vary based on customer demand, which may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions. During periods of decreased customer demand, our asset utilization may suffer, and we may be forced to sell equipment on the open market in order to right size our fleet. This could cause us to incur losses on such sales, particularly during times of a softer used equipment market, either of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability.\nShould demand for freight shipments weaken or our margins suffer due to increased competition or general economic conditions, we may have to limit our fleet size or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods, either of which could have a materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate which will impact our future financial results.\nOur effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by, among other things, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets, changes in the regulations relating to capital expenditure deductions or changes in tax laws where we operate, including the resulting tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Reform Act\u201d). We cannot give any assurance as to the stability or predictability of our effective tax rate in the future because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the tax laws and policies of the countries where we operate.\nThe estimated effects of applicable tax laws, including current interpretation of the Tax Reform Act and recently proposed regulations thereto, have been incorporated into our financial results. The U.S. Treasury Department, Internal Revenue Service, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue future legislation or guidance which impact how provisions of the Tax Reform Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation, which could have a material adverse impact on our effective tax rate, as well as our future financial results and tax payments.\nFurther, our tax returns are subject to periodic reviews or audits by domestic and international authorities, and these audits may result in adjustments to our provision for taxes or allocations of income or deductions that result in tax assessments different from amounts that we have estimated. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these audits to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these audits or that our tax provisions will not change materially or be adequate to satisfy any associated tax liability. If our effective tax rates were to increase or if our tax liabilities exceed our estimates and provisions for such taxes, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nInsurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings.\nWe self-insure, or insure through our wholly owned captive insurance company, a significant portion of our claims exposure resulting from, auto liability, general liability, cargo, and property damage claims, as well as workers' compensation. In addition to insuring portions of our risk, our captive insurance company provides insurance coverage to our owner-operator drivers. We are also responsible for our legal expenses relating to such claims which can be significant both on an aggregate and individual claim basis. Although we reserve for anticipated losses and expenses and periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our experience, estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related costs to settle or resolve them, is inherently difficult, and such costs could exceed our estimates. Accordingly, our actual losses associated with insured claims may differ materially from our estimates and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in material amounts.\nAs a supplement to our self-insurance program, we maintain insurance with excess insurance carriers for potential losses which are in excess of the amounts that we self-insure. Although we believe our aggregate insurance limits should be sufficient to cover our historic claims amounts, the commercial trucking industry has experienced a wave of blockbuster or so-called \u201cnuclear\u201d verdicts, where juries have awarded tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars to accident victims and their families. Given this recent trend, it is possible that one or more claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits. If any claim were to exceed our aggregate insurance coverage, we would bear the excess, in addition to our other self-insured amounts.\nGiven the current claims settlement environment, the amount of coverage available from excess insurance carriers is decreasing, and the premiums for this excess coverage are increasing significantly. For the foregoing reasons, our insurance and claims expenses may increase, or we could increase our self-insured retention as policies are renewed or replaced. In addition, we may assume additional risk within our captive insurance company that we may or may not reinsure. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if (1) our costs or losses significantly exceed our aggregate coverage limits, (2) we are unable to obtain insurance coverage in amounts we deem sufficient, (3) our insurance carriers fail to pay on our insurance claims, or (4) we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided.\nRisks Relating to Our Governance Structure\nVoting control of the Company is concentrated with a Voting Trust that was established for the Schneider family which limits the ability of our other shareholders to influence major corporate transactions.\nWe currently have a dual class common stock structure consisting of (1) Class A common stock, entitled to ten votes per share and (2) Class B common stock, entitled to one vote per share. The Schneider family, including trusts established for the benefit of members of the Schneider family, collectively beneficially own 100% of our outstanding Class A common stock and approximately 43% of our outstanding Class B common stock, representing approximately 94% of the total voting power of all of our outstanding common stock and approximately 70% of our total outstanding common stock.\nA Voting Trust holds the shares of Class A common stock that are beneficially owned by the Schneider family. The independent directors who are members of our Corporate Governance Committee serve as trustees of the Voting Trust, and, in general, those directors have full power and discretion to vote the Class A shares included in the Voting Trust with two exceptions. First, in the case of any Major Transaction (as defined under our Amended and Restated Bylaws, including, most notably, a transaction resulting in more than 40% of the voting power of our common stock being held outside of the Schneider family), the independent directors of our Corporate Governance Committee must vote the shares of common Class A stock held in the Voting Trust as directed by the trustees of certain trusts which have been established for the benefit of certain Schneider family members. As a result, the outcome of the vote on any Major Transaction is not within the discretion of the Voting Trustees. Second, the independent directors of our Corporate Governance Committee must vote the shares of common Class A stock held in the Voting Trust in accordance with a nomination process agreement pursuant to which two specified Schneider family members will be nominated to serve on our Board of Directors on an annual, rotating basis.\nAs a result of these arrangements, the Voting Trust controls the outcome of major corporate transactions that require or may be accomplished by shareholder approval, and our Class B shareholders would be unable to affect the outcome of such transactions should any be proposed.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE and, as a result, qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements relating to our Corporate Governance Committee. Our shareholders will not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of other companies that are subject to such requirements.\nThe Voting Trust has more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors. As a result, we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the corporate governance rules for NYSE-listed companies. As a controlled company, certain exemptions under the NYSE listing standards exempt us from the obligation to comply with certain NYSE corporate governance requirements, including the requirement that we have a Corporate Governance Committee that is composed entirely of independent directors.\nWe have elected to take advantage of this \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption, and the holders of our Class B common stock, therefore may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for NYSE-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could therefore make our Class B common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise depress our stock price.\nThe price of our Class B common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and may fluctuate significantly which may adversely impact investor confidence and increase the likelihood of securities class action litigation.\nOur Class B common stock price has experienced volatility in the past and may remain volatile in the future. Volatility in our stock price can be driven by many factors including divergence between our actual or anticipated financial results and published expectations of analysts or the expectations of the market, the gain or loss of customers, announcements that we, our competitors, our customers, or our vendors or other key partners may make regarding their operating results and other factors which are beyond our control such as market conditions in our industry, new market entrants, technological innovations, and economic and political conditions or events. These and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our Class B common stock to fluctuate substantially. During 2019, the closing stock price of our Class B common stock ranged from a low of $16.67 per share to a high of $24.00 per share. Our Class B common stock is also included in certain market indices, and any change in the composition of these indices to exclude our company may adversely affect our stock price. Increased volatility in the financial markets and/or overall economic conditions may reduce the amounts that we realize in the future on our cash equivalents and/or marketable securities and may reduce our earnings as a result of any impairment charges that we record to reduce recorded values of marketable securities to their fair values.\nFurther, securities class action litigation is often brought against a public company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. Due to changes in our stock price, we may be the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial uninsured costs and divert management\u2019s attention and our resources.\nCertain provisions in our certificate of incorporation, by-laws, and Wisconsin law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the Company, which could decrease the trading price of our Class B common stock.\nEach of our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws, and Wisconsin law, as currently in effect, contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to a bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:\n\u2022\na dual class common stock structure, which provides the Schneider National, Inc. Voting Trust with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring shareholder approval, even if the Schneider National, Inc. Voting Trust beneficially owns significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;\n\u2022\na requirement that certain transactions be conditioned upon approval by 60 percent of the voting power of our capital stock, including any transaction which results in the Schneider family holding less than 40 percent of the voting power of our capital stock, a sale of substantially all of our assets, and a dissolution;\n\u2022\nno provision for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of stock to elect some directors;\n\u2022\nthe inability of shareholders to call a special meeting except when the holders of at least ten percent of all votes entitled to be cast on the proposed issue submit a written demand;\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures for the nomination of candidates for election as directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at shareholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our directors, without a stockholder vote, to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors (including those resulting from an enlargement of the Board of Directors);\n\u2022\nthe requirement that both 75% of the directors constituting the full Board of Directors and stockholders holding at least 80% of our voting stock are required to amend certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our by-laws; and\n\u2022\nthe right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nOur status as a Wisconsin corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the WBCL may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control even if a change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with any person that is the beneficial owner of at least 10 percent of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock (an \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d) for a period of three years after such person becomes an interested shareholder, unless our Board of Directors has approved, before the date on which the shareholder acquired the shares, that a business combination or the purchase of stock made by such interested stockholder on such stock acquisition date. In addition, we may engage in a business combination with an interested shareholder after the expiration of the three-year period with respect to that shareholder only if one or more of the following conditions is satisfied: (1) our Board of Directors approved the acquisition of the stock before the date on which the shareholder acquired the shares, (2) the business combination is approved by a majority of our outstanding voting stock not beneficially owned by the interested shareholder, or (3) the consideration to be received by shareholders meets certain fair price requirements of the WBCL with respect to form and amount.\nThese provisions could have the effect of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also have the effect of discouraging proxy contests and make it more difficult for our non-controlling shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions.\nIn light of present circumstances, we believe these provisions taken as a whole protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers or prevent the removal of incumbent directors. However, these provisions could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of the Company and all of our stockholders.\nWe may change our dividend policy at any time.\nThe declaration and amount of any future dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and is not assured. Each quarter, the Board of Directors considers whether the declaration of a dividend is in the best interest of our shareholders and in compliance with applicable laws and agreements. Although we expect to continue to pay dividends to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock, we have no obligation to do so, and our dividend policy may change at any time without notice. Future dividends may also be affected by factors that our Board of Directors deem relevant, including our potential future capital requirements for investments, legal risks, changes in federal and state income tax laws, or corporate laws and contractual restrictions such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements. As a result, we may not pay dividends at any rate or at all.\nRisks Related to Legal Compliance\nIf the independent contractors with whom we engage under our alternative owner-operator business model are deemed by law to be employees, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nLike many of our competitors, in certain of our service offerings we offer an alternative, owner-operator business model, which provides opportunities for small business owners and private entrepreneurs who own tractors to selectively contract with us as independent contractors to transport freight, which they choose, at contracted rates. Were such independent contractors subsequently determined to be our employees, we would be liable under various federal and state laws for a variety of taxes, wages, and other compensation and benefits, including for prior periods, which were not timely paid or remitted. In the U.S., the regulatory and statutory landscape relating to the classification status of independent contractors (or workers) who work in temporary or flexible jobs and who are paid by the task or project is evolving. Some state governments and federal and state regulatory authorities, as well as independent contractors themselves, have asserted that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry, such as those operating under our owner-operator model, are employees rather than independent contractors for a variety of purposes, including income tax withholding, workers' compensation, wage and hour compensation, unemployment, and other issues. Some states have enacted, or are considering, new laws to make it harder to classify a worker as independent contractors and easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractors as employees. Additionally, federal legislators, among other things, have sought to abolish a safe harbor which allows taxpayers meeting certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a long-standing, recognized practice and extend the FLSA which establishes minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and other employment standards affecting employees in the private sector and in federal, state, and local governments, to independent contractors. Additionally, courts in certain jurisdictions have recently issued decisions that could result in a greater likelihood that independent contractors will be judicially classified as employees. As a result, we are, from time to time, party to administrative proceedings and litigation, including class actions, alleging violations of the FLSA and other state and federal laws which seek retroactive reclassification of certain current and former independent contractors as employees. An adverse decision in such legal proceedings in an amount that materially exceeds our reserves or, federal or state legislation in this area which render the owner-operator model either impractical or extinct thereby curtailing our revenue opportunities, could have an adverse effect our results of operations and profitability.\nWe operate in a regulated industry, and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn the U.S., the DOT, FMCSA, and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business, generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service, equipment operation, safety, financial reporting, and leasing arrangements with independent contractors. We are audited periodically by the DOT to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety, hours-of-service, and other rules and regulations. If we were found to be out of compliance, the DOT could restrict or otherwise impact our operations. We also operate in various Canadian provinces (as granted by the Ministries of Transportation and Communication in such provinces) and contract with third-party carriers to transport freight into Mexico. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws, rules, or regulations to which we are subject, whether actual or alleged, could expose us to fines, penalties, or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements, and judgments. Further, these agencies or governments could institute new laws, rules or regulations, or issue interpretation changes to existing regulations at any time. The short and long-term impacts of changes in legislation or regulations are difficult to predict and could materially and adversely affect our earnings and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials, underground fuel storage tanks, and discharge and retention of storm water. We operate in industrial areas, where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. Certain of our facilities have waste oil or fuel storage tanks and fueling islands. If a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances occurs, if there are releases of hazardous substances we transport, if soil or groundwater contamination is found at our facilities or results from our operations, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be liable for cleanup costs or other damages or fines or penalties, any of which could be in material amounts or have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results.", "PERMNO": 16648, "SIC": 4210, "TIC": "SNDR"}
