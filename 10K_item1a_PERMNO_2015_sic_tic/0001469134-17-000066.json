{"cik": "1469134", "company": "First Community Financial Partners, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nVarious risks and uncertainties, some of which are difficult to predict and beyond First Community\u2019s control, could negatively impact First Community or the Bank. As financial institutions, First Community and the Bank are exposed to interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, operational risk, risks from economic or market conditions, and general business risks among others. Adverse experience with these or other risks could have a material impact on the financial condition and results of operations of First Community or the Bank, as well as the value of First Community common stock.\nThe Agreement and Plan of Merger May Be Terminated in Accordance with Its Terms and the Merger May Not Be Completed.\nThe Agreement and Plan on Merger is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the Merger. Those conditions include: approval of the Agreement and Plan on Merger and the transactions it contemplates by First Community stockholders, receipt of certain requisite regulatory approvals, absence of orders prohibiting completion of the Merger, effectiveness of the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part, approval of the issuance of First Busey common stock, as applicable, for listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the accuracy of the representations and warranties by both parties (subject to the materiality standards set forth in the Agreement and Plan on Merger) and the performance by both parties of their covenants and agreements, and the receipt by both parties of legal opinions from their respective tax counsels. These conditions to the closing of the Merger may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the Merger may not be completed. In addition, the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Agreement and Plan on Merger at any time, before or after stockholder approval, or First Busey or First Community may elect to terminate the Agreement and Plan on Merger in certain other circumstances.\nTermination of the Agreement and Plan of Merger Could Negatively Impact First Community.\nIf the Merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of First Community stockholders declining to approve the Agreement and Plan on Merger, the ongoing business of First Community may be adversely impacted and, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Merger, First Community would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nFirst Community may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on its stock price (including to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed);\n\u2022\nFirst Community may experience negative reactions from its customers, vendors and employees;\n\u2022\nFirst Community will have incurred substantial expenses and will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Merger, whether or not the Merger is completed;\n\u2022\nthe Agreement and Plan on Merger places certain restrictions on the conduct of First Community\u2019s businesses prior to completion of the Merger. Such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of First Busey (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), may prevent First Community from making certain acquisitions or taking certain other specified actions during the pendency of the Merger; and\n\u2022\nmatters relating to the Merger (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by First Community management, which would otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to First Community as an independent company.\nIf the Agreement and Plan on Merger is terminated and First Community\u2019s board of directors seeks another Merger or business combination, First Community stockholders cannot be certain that First Community will be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration First Busey has agreed to provide in the Merger, or that such other Merger or business combination will be completed. If the Agreement and Plan on Merger is terminated under certain circumstances, First Community may be required to pay a termination fee of $9.0 million to First Busey.\nFirst Community Will Be Subject to Business Uncertainties and Contractual Restrictions While the Merger Is Pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on First Community and, consequently, on First Busey. These uncertainties may impair First Community\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with First Community to\nseek to change existing business relationships with First Community. Retention of certain employees may be challenging during the pendency of the Merger, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the business, First Busey\u2019s business following the Merger could be negatively impacted. In addition, the Agreement and Plan on Merger restricts First Community from making certain transactions and taking other specified actions without the consent of First Busey until the Merger occurs. These restrictions may prevent First Community from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger.\nThe Agreement and Plan of Merger Contains Provisions that May Discourage Other Companies from Trying to Acquire First Community for Greater Merger Consideration.\nThe Agreement and Plan on Merger contains provisions that may discourage a third party from submitting a business combination proposal to First Community that might result in greater value to First Community\u2019s stockholders than the proposed Merger with First Busey or may result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire First Community than it might otherwise have proposed to pay absent such provisions. These provisions include a general prohibition on First Community from soliciting, or, subject to certain exceptions relating to the exercise of fiduciary duties by First Community\u2019s board of directors, entering into discussions with any third party regarding any acquisition proposal or offers for competing transactions. First Community also has an unqualified obligation to submit the proposal to approve the Merger to a vote by its stockholders, even if First Community receives an alternative acquisition proposal that its board of directors believes is superior to the Merger, unless the Agreement and Plan on Merger has been terminated in accordance with its terms. In addition, First Community may be required to pay First Busey a termination fee of $9.0 million upon termination of the Agreement and Plan on Merger in certain circumstances involving acquisition proposals for competing transactions.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the highly regulated environment in which we operate.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, supervision and examination. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, FDIC funds, customers and the banking system as a whole, rather than stockholders. These regulations affect the Company\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things.\nAs a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation and supervision primarily by the Federal Reserve. The Bank, as an Illinois-chartered bank, is subject to regulation and supervision by both the IDFPR and the FDIC. We and the Bank undergo periodic examinations by these regulators, which have extensive discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks and bank holding companies.\nThe primary federal and state banking laws and regulations that affect us are described in Item 1. Business under the section captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation.\u201d These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law, which significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. In addition, the Federal Reserve has adopted numerous new regulations addressing banks\u2019 overdraft and mortgage lending practices. Further, the BASEL III regulatory capital reforms increased both the amount and quality of capital that financial institutions must hold.\nSuch changes, including changes regarding interpretations and implementation, could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, such changes could subject the Company to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer, and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil monetary penalties, and/or damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe financial services industry, as well as the broader economy, may be subject to new legislation, regulation, and government policy.\nAt this time, it is difficult to predict the legislative and regulatory changes that will result from the combination of a new President of the United States and the first year since 2010 in which both Houses of Congress and the White House have majority memberships from the same political party. Recently, however, both the new President and senior members of the House of Representatives have advocated for significant reduction of financial services regulation, to include amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act and structural changes to the CFPB. The new Administration and Congress also may cause broader economic changes due to changes in governing ideology and governing style. New appointments to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\ncould affect monetary policy and interest rates, and changes in fiscal policy could affect broader patterns of trade and economic growth. Future legislation, regulation, and government policy could affect the banking industry as a whole, including our business and results of operations, in ways that are difficult to predict. In addition, our results of operations also could be adversely affected by changes in the way in which existing statutes and regulations are interpreted or applied by courts and government agencies.\nCompetition from financial institutions and other financial services providers may adversely affect our growth and profitability and have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and experience intense competition from other financial institutions in our markets. We compete with these institutions in making loans, attracting deposits and recruiting and retaining talented people. We also compete with non-bank financial service providers, including mortgage companies, finance companies, online lenders, mutual funds and credit unions. Many of these competitors are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions that we are and may be able to compete more effectively as a result. We have observed that the competition in our market for making commercial loans has resulted in more competitive pricing and credit structure, as well as intense competition for qualified commercial lending officers. We also may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of our smaller size, limited branch network, narrower product offerings and lack of geographic diversification as compared to some of our larger competitors. Although our competitive strategy is to provide a distinctly superior customer and employee experience, this strategy could be unsuccessful. Our growth and profitability depend on our continued ability to compete effectively within our market area and our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business is subject to the conditions of the local economy in which we operate and weakness in the local economy and the real estate markets may materially and adversely affect us.\nOur success is dependent to a large extent upon the general economic conditions in the Illinois and Chicago area where the Bank provides banking and financial services. Accordingly, the local economic conditions in Chicago have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of customers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services the Company offers, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the Company operates, in the state of Illinois generally and in the United States as a whole. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors: economic growth; efficient capital markets; low inflation; low unemployment; high business and investor confidence; and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by: declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment; natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\nThe financial condition of the State of Illinois, in which the largest portion of the Company\u2019s customer base resides, is among the most troubled of any state in the United States with credit downgrade concerns, severe pension under-funding, budget deficits and political standoffs. State budget restructuring to improve its financial condition may have negative financial effects on local governments and businesses, their employees, and directly and indirectly the Company\u2019s customers. Conversely, a lack of state budget restructuring to achieve budget balance and growing debt burden may also have negative financial effects on local governments and businesses, their employees, and directly and indirectly the Company\u2019s customers.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments, which are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and which may differ from actual results.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and general reporting practices within the financial services industry, which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Some accounting policies, such as those pertaining to our allowance for loan and lease losses and deferred tax assets and the necessity of any related valuation allowance, require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in subsequent periods.\nOur allowance for loan and lease losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nMaking loans is a substantial part of our business, and every loan we make is subject to the risk that it will not be repaid or that any underlying collateral in the case of secured loans will not be sufficient to assure full repayment. Among other things, the risk of non-payment is affected by:\n\u009f\nchanges in economic, market and industry conditions,\n\u009f\nthe credit risks associated with the particular borrower and type of loan,\n\u009f\ncash flow of the borrower and/or the project being financed,\n\u009f\nthe duration of the loan, and\n\u009f\nopportunities to identify potential loan repayment issues when remedial action may be most effective.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses, which is an accounting reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which we believe is adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which are subject to material changes. Deterioration in or stagnation of economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans and any underlying collateral, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in our allowance for loan and lease losses.\nIn addition, our federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses and, based on judgments that differ from those of our management, may require an increase in our provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs. Further, if loan charge-offs in future periods exceed our allowance for loan and lease losses, we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance. Any increases in our allowance for loan and lease losses will result in a decrease in net income, and possibly capital, and may have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk, including interest rate fluctuations, that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve.\nChanges in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect:\n\u009f\nthe Company\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits,\n\u009f\nthe fair value of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, and\n\u009f\nthe average duration of the Company\u2019s securities portfolio.\nIf the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, the Company\u2019s net interest income, and therefore, earnings and cash flows, could be adversely affected. Earnings and cash flows could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings.\nAlthough management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies, to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the Company\u2019s results of operations, if these strategies prove ineffective, or if any substantial, unexpected and prolonged change in market interest rates occurs, such events could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe have counterparty risk and therefore we may be materially and adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be materially and negatively affected by the actions and the soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are generally interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, credit or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and regularly engage in transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional customers. Many of these transactions may expose us to credit or other risks if another financial institution experiences adverse circumstances. In certain circumstances, the collateral that we hold may be insufficient to fully cover the risk that a counterparty defaults on its obligations, which may cause us to experience losses that could have a material adverse affect on us.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. First Community\u2019s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nThere have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. Employee fraud, errors and employee and customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to civil claims for negligence.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls and procedures designed to reduce the risk of loss from employee or customer fraud or misconduct, employee errors and operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the Company\u2019s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are dependent upon outside third parties for the processing and handling of our records and data.\nWe rely on software developed by third party vendors to process various Company transactions. In some cases, we have contracted with third parties to run their proprietary software on behalf of the Company. These systems include, but are not limited to, general ledger, payroll, employee benefits, loan and deposit processing, and securities portfolio management. While the Company performs a review of controls instituted by the applicable vendor over these programs in accordance with industry standards and performs its own testing of user controls, we must rely on the continued maintenance of controls by these third party vendors, including safeguards over the security of customer data. In addition, the Company maintains, or contracts with third parties to maintain, backups of key processing output daily in the event of a failure on the part of any of these systems. Nonetheless, we may incur a temporary disruption in our ability to conduct our business or process our transactions, or incur damage to our reputation, if the third party vendor fails to adequately maintain internal controls or institute necessary changes to systems. Such disruption or a breach of security may have a material adverse effect on us.\nSystem failure or breaches of our network security, including with respect to our Internet banking activities, could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure we use in our operations and Internet banking activities could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Computer break-ins, \u201cphishing\u201d and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, as well as that of our customers engaging in Internet banking activities. In addition, advances in computer capabilities or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of our systems designed to protect customer data.\nThese risks have increased for all financial institutions as new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others, have all increased. In addition to cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers recently have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions, retailers and government agencies, particularly denial of service attacks, that are designed to disrupt key business or government services, such as customer-facing web sites.\nThe Company also faces risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches in connection with credit card and debit card transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding the Company\u2019s customers through various third parties, including merchant acquiring banks, payment processors, payment card networks and its processors. Some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyber-attacks, and because the transactions involve third parties and environments such as the point of sale that the Company does not control or secure, future security breaches or cyber-attacks affecting any of these third parties could impact the Company through no fault of its own, and in some cases it may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them. Further cyber-attacks or other breaches in the future, whether affecting the Company or others, could intensify consumer concern and regulatory focus and result in reduced use of payment cards and increased costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. To the extent we are involved in any future cyber-attacks or other breaches, the Company\u2019s reputation could be affected, would could also have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAlthough we have procedures in place to prevent or limit the effects of any of these potential problems and intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to mitigate the risk of such occurrences, these measures could be unsuccessful. Any interruption in, or breach in security of, our computer systems and network infrastructure, or that of our Internet banking customers, could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to lending concentration risks.\nAs of December 31, 2016, 76.15% of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans, of which approximately 47.73% were commercial real estate loans. Our commercial loans are typically larger in amount than loans to individual consumers and, therefore, have the potential for higher losses on an individual loan basis. Credit quality issues on larger commercial loans, if they were to occur, could cause greater volatility in reported credit quality performance measures, such as total impaired or non-performing loans, and the amount of charge-offs and recoveries between periods. The deterioration of any one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in uncollectible loans, which would have a material adverse impact on us. In such case, we may not be able to realize the amount of security that we anticipated at the time of originating the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition or capital levels.\nThe Company is a bank holding company and its sources of funds are limited.\nThe Company is a bank holding company, and its operations are primarily conducted by the Bank, which is subject to significant federal and state regulation. The Company\u2019s ability to receive dividends or loans from the Bank is restricted and therefore the ability to pay dividends to shareholders is restricted. Until June 30, 2015, the Bank was unable to pay dividends due to negative retained earnings. Dividend payments by the Bank to the Company in the future, if any, will require generation of future earnings by the Bank and could require regulatory approval if any proposed dividends are in excess of prescribed guidelines. Further, as a structural matter, the Company\u2019s right to participate in the assets of the Bank in the event of a liquidation or reorganization of the Bank would be subject to the claims of the Bank\u2019s creditors, including depositors, which would take priority except to the extent the Company may be a creditor with a recognized claim. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank had deposits and other liabilities of approximately $1.2 billion.\nWe may not be able to access sufficient and cost-effective sources of liquidity.\nLiquidity is essential to our business and drives our ability to make new loans or invest in securities. In addition, the Company requires liquidity to meet its deposit and debt obligations as they come due. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or the economy generally. Factors that could reduce our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the Chicago area market, difficult credit markets or adverse regulatory actions against us.\nAs part of our liquidity management, we use a number of funding sources in addition to what is provided by in-market deposit and repayments and maturities of loans and investments. Although we have recently increased our funding from our core customers to reduce our reliance on wholesale funding, we continue to use brokered money market accounts and certificates of deposits, out-of-local-market certificates of deposit, broker/dealer repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased and FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank advances as a source of liquidity.\nOur liquidity position is affected by the amount of cash and other liquid assets on hand, payment of interest and dividends on our outstanding debt and equity instruments, capital we inject into the Bank, redemption of our previously issued debt, proceeds we raise through the issuance of debt and equity instruments, and dividends received from the Bank. Our future liquidity position may be materially adversely affected if, in the future, one or a combination of the following events occur:\n\u009f\nthe Bank reports net losses or its earnings are weak relative to our cash flow needs as a holding company,\n\u009f\nwe deem it advisable or are required by our regulators to use cash at the holding company level to support loan growth of the Bank or address other capital needs of the Bank through downstream capital injections, or\n\u009f\nwe have difficulty raising cash at the holding company level through the issuance of debt or equity securities or accessing additional sources of credit.\nOur usual liquidity management challenges include responding to potential volatility in our customers\u2019 deposit balances. We primarily use advances from the FHLB, broker/dealer repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased to meet our immediate liquidity needs. We maintain stable client deposits, which allows us to not heavily rely on wholesale funding sources. However, our client deposits may not remain at current levels and we may not be able to maintain the recent reduced reliance on wholesale deposits. Increased customer confidence in general economic conditions, higher expected rates of return\non other investments (including a rise in interest rates) or additional restrictions on the availability of FDIC coverage could each cause our customers to move all or a portion of their deposits to other investment options, thus causing a reduction in our deposits and increasing our reliance on wholesale or other funding sources.\nGiven the losses recorded by our legacy bank subsidiaries and affiliates from 2008 through 2011, the negative retained earnings at the Bank until June 30, 2015, and the resulting limitations on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to First Community, we have historically been dependent upon our current cash position and cash proceeds generated by capital raises to meet liquidity needs at the holding company level. If we foresee that we face diminished liquidity, we may, to the extent possible, seek to issue additional debt or securities which could cause ownership or economic dilution to our current shareholders.\nChanges in our credit ratings could increase our financing costs or make it more difficult for us to obtain funding or capital on commercially acceptable terms.\nWe are rated by several different rating agencies, including International Data Corporation and Bankrate.com. Many factors, both within and out of our control, may cause these agencies to downgrade their ratings related to the Company, which could subject us to negative publicity, adversely impact our ability to acquire or retain deposits and increase our cost of borrowing or limit our asset growth. Also, our credit ratings are an important factor to the institutions that provide our sources of liquidity, and reductions in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity, increase our borrowing costs, limit our access to the capital markets or trigger unfavorable contractual obligations.\nOur business strategy is dependent on our continued ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified and experienced personnel in senior management and customer relationship positions.\nWe believe our future success is dependent, in part, on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and experienced personnel in key senior management and other positions. Our competitive strategy is to provide each of our commercial customers with a highly qualified relationship manager that will serve as the customer\u2019s key point of contact with us. Achieving the status of a \u201ctrusted advisor\u201d for our customers also requires that we minimize relationship manager turnover and provide stability to our customer relationships. Competition for experienced personnel in our industry is intense, and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain such personnel.\nOur reputation could be damaged by negative publicity.\nReputational risk, or the risk to us from negative publicity, is inherent in our business. Negative publicity can result from actual or alleged conduct in a number of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, inadequate protection of customer data, ethical behavior of our employees, and from actions taken by regulators, ratings agencies and others as a result of that conduct. Damage to our reputation could impact our ability to attract new or maintain existing loan and deposit customers, employees and business relationships.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to certain additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we will consider and may enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services. These activities can involve a number of uncertainties, risks and expenses, including the investment of significant time and resources, and our projected price and profitability targets may not be attainable or our efforts may not be successful. These initiatives have required and will continue to require us to enter geographical markets that are new to us. In addition, new lines of business and new products and services could significantly impact the effectiveness of our system of internal controls, and present requirements for legal compliance with which we were previously unfamiliar. Failure to successfully manage these risks could have a material adverse affect on us.\nConsumers and businesses are increasingly using non-banks to complete their financial transactions, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing consumers and businesses to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods. For example, the wide acceptance of Internet-based commerce has resulted in a number of alternative payment processing systems and lending platforms in which banks play only minor roles. Customers can now maintain funds in prepaid debit cards or digital currencies, and pay bills and transfer funds directly without the direct assistance of banks. The diminishing role of banks as financial intermediaries has resulted and could continue to result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the potential loss of lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience difficulties in managing our growth.\nOur future success, in part, depends on our achieving growth in commercial banking relationships that results in increased commercial loans at yields that are profitable to us. Achieving our growth targets requires us to attract customers who currently bank at other financial institutions in our market, thereby increasing our share of the market. Although we believe that we have the necessary resources in place to successfully manage our future growth, our growth strategy exposes us to certain risks and expenses, including adversely affecting our results of operations and placing a significant strain on our management, personnel, systems and resources. In addition, maintaining credit quality while growing our loan portfolio is critical to achieving and sustaining profitable growth. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively. If we fail to do so, we would be materially harmed.\nRegulatory requirements, growth plans or operating results may require us to raise additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. At December 31, 2016, the Bank was categorized as \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d under the applicable regulatory capital framework. To the extent regulatory requirements change, our future operating results erode capital or we seek to expand through loan growth, we may be required to raise additional capital. Our ability to raise capital in any such event would depend on conditions in the capital markets, which are outside of our control, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, our ability to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms is uncertain. The inability to attract new capital investment, or to attract capital on terms acceptable to us, could have a material adverse impact on us.\nWe have not paid a dividend on our common stock since the Company\u2019s formation in 2006. In addition, regulatory restrictions and liquidity constraints at the holding company level could impair our ability to make distributions on our outstanding securities.\nHistorically, our primary source of funds at the holding company level has been debt and equity issuances. The Bank and its predecessor banks had not paid dividends to the Company until 2015, and the Company has not paid dividends to our common shareholders, since the Company\u2019s formation in 2006. Current and future liquidity constraints at the holding company level could continue to impair our ability to declare and pay dividends on our common stock or pay interest on our outstanding debt securities in the future. If we are unable to pay dividends or interest on our outstanding securities in the future, the market value of such securities may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. In addition, our election not to opt out of JOBS Act extended accounting transition period may make our financial statements less easily comparable to the financial statements of other companies.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, though we may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances, including if, before the end of such five years, we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC (which depends on, among other things, having a market value of common stock held by non-affiliates in excess of $700 million). We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of an investment in our common stock to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u009f\ngeneral market conditions;\n\u009f\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u009f\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u009f\nchanges in or failure to meet publicly disclosed expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u009f\ndowngrades in any securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry analysts;\n\u009f\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of similar companies;\n\u009f\nany future sales of our common stock or other securities; and\n\u009f\nadditions or departures of key personnel.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These types of broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In the past, shareholders have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. Any similar litigation against us could result in substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and harm our business or results of operations.\nOur stock is relatively thinly traded.\nAlthough our common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market, the average daily trading volume of our common stock is relatively small compared to many public companies. The desired market characteristics of depth, liquidity, and orderliness require the substantial presence of willing buyers and sellers in the marketplace at any given time. In our case, this presence depends on the individual decisions of a relatively small number of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Due to the relatively small trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause the stock price to fall more than would be justified by the inherent worth of the Company. Conversely, attempts to purchase a significant amount of our stock could cause the market price to rise above the reasonable inherent worth of the Company.", "PERMNO": 15514, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FCFP"}
