{"cik": "1042729", "company": "MERCANTILE BANK CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nThe following risk factors could affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report because they could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. Before you buy our common stock, you should know that investing in our common stock involves risks, including the risks described below. The risks that are highlighted here are not the only ones we face. If the adverse matters referred to in any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operations could be adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe Coronavirus Pandemic has impacted our business, financial condition and results of operations and will continue to have an impact, the scope and duration of which is highly uncertain and dependent on factors that are outside of our control.\nThe ongoing pandemic associated with the spread of Covid-19 has caused significant disruptions throughout the State of Michigan and across the United States and global economies and financial markets. The Coronavirus Pandemic has impacted our business, financial condition and results of operations and will continue to do so. For example, we derive a large percentage of our net income from net interest income, which is derived from the yield on interest-earning assets offset by our cost of funds. Our net interest income has been negatively impacted primarily due to reduced interest rates on variable-rate commercial loans resulting from the Federal Open Market Committee (\u201cFOMC\u201d) significantly decreasing the targeted federal funds rate by 225 basis points during the second half of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020.\nOur results may also be negatively impacted by a deterioration in the quality of our loan portfolio due to the impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic on our loan customers. While we actively monitor the credit quality of our loan portfolio and make adjustments to our allowance for loan losses accordingly, the Coronavirus Pandemic has created significant disruptions in the United States economy, making it difficult to predict its impact with a high degree of certainty. While we believe we have appropriately assessed and presented our loan portfolio and allowance for loan losses to date in accordance with applicable accounting standards, we cannot be certain of that, nor can we be certain that we will adequately account for the future negative impacts of the Coronavirus Pandemic. This could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations by increasing the amount of allowance for loan loss provisions reflected in our operating expenses, decreasing our interest income as borrowers become unable to repay their loans and increasing our operating expenses due to collection costs.\nWe are exposed to several additional risks associated with the Coronavirus Pandemic, including the risk that our operating effectiveness will decrease as we adapt to new policies requiring that our employees work from home; that we may temporarily lose the services of key members of our management team; that the economic downturn will negatively impact demand for loans across our loan portfolio; that the collateral securing our loans will decline in value; that reduced consumer spending will prolong the negative economic impacts of the Coronavirus Pandemic; that our portfolio of securities available for sale will decrease in value; and that we may face litigation due to our handling of the challenges associated with the Coronavirus Pandemic, including our participation in the Paycheck Protection Program.\nWhile we believe that we have navigated the difficult environment associated with the Coronavirus Pandemic with success thus far, there remains a high level of uncertainty due to the potential spread of new variants and surges in cases, and this could expose our business, financial condition and results of operations to risks that could have a negative impact on your investment.\nAdverse changes in economic conditions or interest rates may negatively affect our earnings, capital and liquidity.\nThe results of operations for financial institutions, including our bank, may be materially and adversely affected by changes in prevailing local and national economic conditions, including declines in real estate market values and the related declines in value of our real estate collateral, rapid increases or decreases in interest rates and changes in the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government. Our profitability is heavily influenced by the spread between the interest rates we earn on loans and investments and the interest rates we pay on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Substantially all of our loans are to businesses and individuals in Western, Central, and Southeastern Michigan, and any decline in the economy of these areas could adversely affect us. Like most banking institutions, our net interest spread and margin will be affected by general economic conditions and other factors that influence market interest rates and our ability to respond to changes in these rates. At any given time, our assets and liabilities may be such that they will be affected differently by a given change in interest rates.\nSignificant declines in the value of commercial real estate could adversely impact us.\nApproximately 61% of our total commercial loans, or about 53% of our total loans, relate to commercial real estate. Stressed economic conditions may reduce the value of commercial real estate and strain the financial condition of our commercial real estate borrowers, especially in the land development and non-owner occupied commercial real estate segments of our loan portfolio. Those difficulties could adversely affect us and could produce losses and other adverse effects on our business.\nMarket volatility may adversely affect us.\nThe capital and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without apparent regard to those issuers\u2019 underlying financial strength. Future levels of market disruption and volatility may have an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access capital and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry.\nWe face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors. Our future growth and success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive environment. We compete for deposits, loans and other financial services with numerous Michigan-based and national and regional banks, thrifts, credit unions and other financial institutions as well as other entities that provide financial services, including securities firms and mutual funds. Some of the financial institutions and financial service organizations with which we compete are not subject to the same degree of regulation as we are. Many of our competitors have been in business for many years, have established customer bases, are larger, have substantially higher lending limits than we do and offer larger branch networks and other services which we do not, including trust and international banking services. Most of these entities have greater capital and other resources than we do, which, among other things, may allow them to price their services at levels more favorable to the customer and to provide larger credit facilities than we do. This competition may limit our growth or earnings. Under specified circumstances (that have been modified by the Dodd-Frank Act and EGRRCPA), securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act may acquire banks and other financial institutions. Federal banking law affects the competitive environment in which we conduct our business. The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. These technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties.\nOur risk management systems may fall short of their intended objectives.\nWe seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. Our risk management process seeks to balance our ability to profit from investing or lending positions with our exposure to potential losses. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. Thus, we may, in the course of our activities, incur losses.\nWe may not be able to successfully adapt to evolving industry standards and market pressures.\nOur success depends, in part, on the ability to adapt products and services to evolving industry standards. There is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices. This can reduce net interest income and noninterest income from fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to modify or adapt existing products and services or develop new products and services. We may not be successful in introducing new products and services in response to industry trends or developments in technology, or those new products may not achieve market acceptance. As a result, we could lose business, be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients, or be subject to cost increases. As a result, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur inability to execute or integrate potential future acquisitions successfully could impede us from realizing all of the benefits of the acquisitions, which could weaken our operations.\nIn addition to pursuing organic growth, we may also pursue strategic acquisition opportunities that we believe will fit our core philosophy and culture, enhance our profitability and provide appropriate risk-adjusted returns. These acquisition opportunities could be material to our business and involve a number of risks, including the following:\n\u00b0 intense competition from other banking organizations and other acquirers for potential merger candidates drives market pricing;\n\u00b0 time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions may divert human and capital resources without producing the desired returns;\n\u00b0 estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets are inherently complex and may be inaccurate;\n\u00b0 potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of targets; and\n\u00b0 regulatory timeframes for review of applications may limit the number and frequency of transactions we may be able to consummate.\nIf we are unable to successfully integrate potential future acquisitions, we could be impeded from realizing all of the benefits of those acquisitions and could weaken our business operations. The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, may preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us and could harm our results of operations. In addition, the overall integration of the combining companies may result in unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities and competitive responses, and may cause our stock price to decline. The difficulties of integrating an acquisition include, among others:\n\u00b0 unanticipated issues in integration of information, communications and other systems;\n\u00b0 unanticipated incompatibility of logistics, marketing and administrative methods;\n\u00b0 maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees;\n\u00b0 integrating the business cultures of both companies;\n\u00b0 preserving important strategic client relationships;\n\u00b0 coordinating geographically diverse organizations; and\n\u00b0 consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations.\nFinally, even if the operations of an acquisition are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings or growth opportunities we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame as well.\nOur inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our business strategy, which, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Even routine funding transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur credit losses could increase and our allowance may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses.\nThe risk of nonpayment of loans is inherent in all lending activities, and nonpayment, when it occurs, may have a materially adverse effect on our earnings and overall financial condition as well as the value of our common stock. Our focus on commercial lending may result in a larger concentration of loans to small businesses. As a result, we may assume different or greater lending risks than other banks. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for losses based on several factors. If our assumptions are wrong, our allowance may not be sufficient to cover our losses, which would have an adverse effect on our operating results. The actual amounts of future provisions for loan losses cannot be determined at this time and may exceed the amounts of past provisions. Additions to our allowance decrease our net income.\nWe rely heavily on our management and other key personnel, and the loss of any of them may adversely affect our operations.\nWe are and will continue to be dependent upon the services of our management team, including our executive officers and our other senior managers. The unanticipated loss of our executive officers, or any of our other senior managers, could have an adverse effect on our growth and performance.\nIn addition, we continue to depend on our key commercial loan officers. Several of our commercial loan officers are responsible, or share responsibility, for generating and managing a significant portion of our commercial loan portfolio. Our success can be attributed in large part to the relationships these officers as well as members of our management team have developed and are able to maintain with our customers as we continue to implement our community banking philosophy. The loss of any of these commercial loan officers could adversely affect our loan portfolio and performance, and our ability to generate new loans. Many of our key employees have signed agreements with us agreeing not to compete with us in one or more of our markets for specified time periods if they leave employment with us. However, we may not be able to effectively enforce such agreements.\nSome of the other financial institutions in our markets also require their key employees to sign agreements that preclude or limit their ability to leave their employment and compete with them or solicit their customers. These agreements make it more difficult for us to hire loan officers with experience in our markets who can immediately solicit their former or new customers on our behalf.\nDirect and indirect effects of climate change may adversely affect us.\nClimate change presents immediate and long-term risks to us and to our customers and communities, with risks expected to increase over time. Climate change refers to risk of life and property damage occurring due to naturally occurring events induced by human behavior and is divided into physical risk and indirect risk. Physical risk refers to results of severe weather, such as floods, hurricanes, rising sea levels, fires and water availability. Indirect risk refers to how changes in regulation, conscious consumer choices, competition for sustainable products, and reduced demand for goods or services that produce significant green-house gas emissions may have on the results and operations of a company. Physical effects of climate change to our offices, branches or personnel could have an immediate adverse effect on our operations and financial condition, whereas indirect consequences may result in increased expenditures to comply with climate-related regulations.\nSimilarly, physical effects could have a severe impact on the business and operations of our customers and vendors. Furthermore, consumer choices and shareholder demands could require our customers to invest more in cleaner energy manufacturing and procurement and to compete with innovative new products that generate lower emissions, which may or may not be successful. If our customers are not able to keep up with evolving climate change effects, it could ultimately have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Lastly, like other financial institutions, we also run a reputational risk of financing businesses that are responsible for significant green-house gas emissions or are related to carbon-based energy sources. While our risk management framework monitors various types of risks and applies risk mitigation techniques including for environmental risks, and while we have been conscious of our own carbon footprint and have established an ESG Committee, introduction of new climate-related legislation and related compliance costs as well as the unpredictable effects of climate change on us or our customers could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, even if temporary in nature.\nThe adoption of the Secured Overnight Funding Rate may adversely affect interest income or expense, and may be more volatile than other benchmark or market interest rates.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), which oversees Libor, formally announced that it could not assure the continued existence of Libor in its current form beyond the end of 2021, and that an orderly transition process to one or more alternative benchmarks should begin. In June 2017, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d), a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions organized by the Federal Reserve, announced that it had selected a modified version of the unpublished Broad Treasuries Financing Rate as the preferred alternative reference rate for U.S. dollar obligations. That rate, now referred to as the Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), is determined based upon actual transactions in certain portions of the bi-lateral and tri-party overnight repurchase agreement markets for certain U.S. Treasury obligations. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York (\u201cFRBNY\u201d) began publication of the SOFR in April 2018.\nDuring 2019 and 2020, among other things, the ARRC published a white paper on ways in which market participants could use SOFR in cash markets, conducted surveys of market participants, engaged with cognizant U.S. government agencies and private sector groups regarding tax, securities, and derivatives issues presented by the transition from Libor, published sample transition provisions for a variety of types of loan and note agreements, and investigated methods by which a forward-looking term SOFR index could be established. To facilitate the development of a generally-recognized forward-looking SOFR index, on March 2, 2020 the FRBNY began publication of 30-, 90-, and 180-day SOFR Averages, as well as a SOFR Index, on each business day. The FRBNY has stated that it will consider the potential benefits of introducing calendar month-based rates and/or adding further tenors as additional reference rates.\nIn November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration announced a consultation regarding the cessation of the publication of Libor. The consultation proposed a December 31, 2021 cessation for all tenors of various foreign currencies and for the one week and two-month U.S. dollar Libor, and a June 30, 2023 cessation for the remaining overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and twelve-month U.S. dollar Libor tenors. This represented an 18-month extension of Libor publication for the most frequently used tenors of U.S. dollar Libor from the cessation date originally proposed in 2017. The consultation period closed on January 25, 2021. The ICE Benchmark Administration concluded the consultation on its intent to cease publication of one week and two-month U.S. dollar Libor on December 31, 2021 and to extend the publication of all remaining U.S. dollar Libor tenors until June 30, 2023 for legacy contracts.\nEffective January 1, 2022, we replaced the 30-Day Libor Rate with the CBM Term SOFR Rate for all new floating rate commercial loan commitments. It is expected that currently outstanding commercial loans tied to the 30-Day Libor Rate will convert to an equivalent fallback SOFR Rate on or about June 30, 2023.\nThe FRBNY, that originally started publishing SOFR, states that it obtains information from DTCC Solutions LLC, an affiliate of DTCC. FRBNY currently publishes SOFR daily on its website at https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/sofr. FRBNY states on its publication page for SOFR that use of SOFR is subject to important disclaimers, limitations and indemnification obligations, including that FRBNY may alter the methods of calculations, publication schedule, rate revision practices or availability of SOFR at any time without notice. The foregoing Internet website is an inactive textual reference only, meaning that the information contained on the website is not part of this filing or incorporated by reference herein.\nSince the initial publication of SOFR, daily changes in the rate have, on occasion, been more volatile than daily changes in comparable benchmark or market interest rates, and SOFR over time may bear little or no relation to the historical actual or historical indicative data. In addition, the return on and value of SOFR-linked instruments may fluctuate more than floating rate securities that are linked to less volatile interest rates.\nChanges in SOFR could adversely affect the amount of interest that accrues on SOFR-linked instruments.\nBecause SOFR is published by the FRBNY based on data received from other sources, we have no control over its determination, calculation or publication. There can be no assurance that SOFR will not be discontinued or fundamentally altered in a manner that is materially adverse to the interests of investors in SOFR-linked instruments. If the manner in which SOFR is calculated is changed, that change may result in a change in the amount of interest that accrues on the SOFR-linked instruments. In addition, the interest rate on SOFR-linked instruments may for any day not be adjusted for any modification or amendments to SOFR for that day that the FRBNY may publish if the interest rate for that day has already been determined prior to such determination. There is no assurance that changes in SOFR could not have a material adverse effect on the yield on, value of, and market for SOFR-linked instruments.\nFurther, SOFR is a relatively new interest rate, and the FRBNY or any successor, as administrator of SOFR, may make methodological or other changes that could change the value of SOFR, including changes related to the methodology by which SOFR is calculated, eligibility criteria applicable to the transactions used to calculate SOFR or timing related to the publication of SOFR. If the manner in which SOFR is calculated is changed, the change may result in a reduction of the amount of interest payable on loans we have made to customers. The administrator of SOFR may withdraw, modify, suspend or discontinue the calculation or dissemination of SOFR in its sole discretion and without notice, and has no obligation to consider the interests of investors in calculating, withdrawing, modifying, amending, suspending or discontinuing SOFR.\nOur accounting policies and methods are the basis for how we prepare our consolidated financial statements, and they require management to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nAccounting policies and processes are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. We must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and processes so they comply with U.S. GAAP. In some cases, we must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in our reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nWe have identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. We have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding management\u2019s judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, we cannot guarantee that we will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements. For additional information, see \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d beginning on page of this Annual Report and \u201cNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d beginning on page of this Annual Report.\nWe continually encounter technological change, and we may have fewer resources than our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements.\nThe banking industry is undergoing technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we do. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers.\nDamage to our reputation could materially harm our business.\nOur relationship with many of our clients is predicated upon our reputation as a fiduciary and a service provider that adheres to the highest standards of ethics, service quality and regulatory compliance. Adverse publicity, regulatory actions, litigation, operational failures, the failure to meet client expectations and other issues with respect to one or more of our businesses could materially and adversely affect our reputation, our ability to attract and retain clients or our sources of funding for the same or other businesses. Preserving and enhancing our reputation also depends on maintaining systems and procedures that address known risks and regulatory requirements, as well as our ability to identify and mitigate additional risks that arise due to changes in our businesses and the marketplaces in which we operate, the regulatory environment and client expectations. If any of these developments has a material effect on our reputation, our business will suffer.\nOur business is subject to operational risks.\nWe, like most financial institutions, are exposed to many types of operational risks, including the risk of fraud by employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors. Operational errors may include clerical or record keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Given our volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully corrected. Our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process our transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical system flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect.\nWe may also be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including, for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages, which may give rise to losses in service to customers and to loss or liability to us. We are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as are we, and to the risk that our or our vendors\u2019 business continuity and data security systems prove not to be adequate. We also face the risk that the design of our controls and procedures proves inadequate or is circumvented, causing delays in detection or errors in information. Although we maintain a system of controls designed to keep operational risks at appropriate levels, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer losses from operational risks in the future that may be material in amount.\nWe face the risk of cyber-attack to our computer systems.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in systems and on networks. The secure processing, maintenance and use of this information is critical to our operations. To date, we have not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, but our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat, and it is possible that we could experience a significant event in the future. Cybersecurity threats include unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber-attacks and other events. Remote working of employees during the Coronavirus Pandemic introduces additional potential cybersecurity risks due to the use of home networks, video conferencing and other remote work technologies over which we do not have as much control as our internal systems. Cyber threats may derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. If one or more of these events occurs, it could result in the disclosure of confidential client information, damage to our reputation with our clients and the market, additional costs to us (such as repairing systems or adding new personnel or protection technologies), regulatory penalties and financial losses, to both us and our clients and customers. Such events could also cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations (such as the lack of availability of our online banking system), as well as the operations of our clients, customers or other third parties. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers. Although we maintain safeguards to protect against these risks, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer losses in the future that may be material in amount.\nIn March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution\u2019s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution\u2019s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. In August 2019, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a statement recommending that banking organizations use a standardized approach to assess and improve cybersecurity preparedness. The agencies noted that the use of standardized tools, such as the FFIEC Cybersecurity Assessment Tool, makes firms better able to track their progress over time, and to share information and best practices with other financial institutions, a behavior which the bank regulatory agencies encourage. In April 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a statement highlighting the risks presented by banking organizations\u2019 use of cloud computing services in their business. The statement noted specific risks unique to the cloud computing environment, and the importance of ongoing controls of virtual infrastructure, care in the use of containers for data, and the sensitivity of use of managed security services, among other things. Although guidance of this nature does not have the full force and effect of law, it sets out supervisory priorities and expectations regarding safe and sound operation. Failure to observe such guidance may result in supervisory identification of unsafe or unsound practices or other deficiencies in risk management or other areas that do not constitute violations of law or regulation.\nRegulatory Risks\nThe timing and effect of Federal Reserve Board policy normalization remains uncertain.\nIn light of the evolving risks to economic activity posed by the Coronavirus Pandemic, the FOMC took five separate actions in March, 2020 impacting the federal funds rate. Taken together, those actions reduced the federal funds target range to 0.00% to 0.25%, directed expanded purchases of U.S. Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities and large scale overnight and term repurchase operations, committed the FOMC to use its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy, and provided U.S. dollar swap lines and repurchase facilities to certain foreign central banks and international organizations.\nOn August 27, 2020, the FOMC announced revisions to its Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy (\u201cStatement\u201d). Under the revised Statement, the FOMC emphasized that its statutory mandate of maximum employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal, and that its policy decisions would be informed by its assessment of the shortfall from maximum employment. Regarding price stability, the Statement provides that the FOMC seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2% over time. Accordingly, when inflation has been persistently below 2%, the FOMC will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2% for some time. The revised Statement has been reflected in subsequent actions by the FOMC.\nAt the conclusion of its meeting on January 26, 2022, the FOMC issued the following statement:\nIndicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months but are being affected by the recent sharp rise in COVID-19 cases. Job gains have been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined substantially. Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.\nThe path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation. Risks to the economic outlook remain, including from new variants of the virus.\nThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 0.25 percent. With inflation above 2 percent and a strong labor market, the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. The Committee decided to continue to reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases, bringing them to an end in early March. Beginning in February, the Committee will increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $20 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $10 billion per month. The Federal Reserve\u2019s ongoing purchases and holdings of securities will continue to foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.\nIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee\u2019s goals. The Committee\u2019s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\nWe are subject to significant government regulation, and any regulatory changes may adversely affect us.\nThe banking industry is heavily regulated under both federal and state law. These regulations are primarily intended to protect customers, the federal deposit insurance fund, and the stability of the U.S. financial system, not our creditors or shareholders. Existing state and federal banking laws subject us to substantial limitations with respect to the making of loans, the purchase of securities, the payment of dividends and many other aspects of our business. Some of these laws may benefit us, others may increase our costs of doing business, or otherwise adversely affect us and create competitive advantages for others. Regulations affecting banks and financial services companies undergo continuous change, which may be accelerated by changes in the federal administration, and we cannot predict the ultimate effect of these changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability or financial condition. Federal economic and monetary policy may also affect our ability to attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads. The implementation, amendment or repeal of federal financial services laws or regulations may limit our business opportunities, impose additional costs on us, impact our revenues or the value of our assets, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMinimum capital requirements may adversely affect our ability (and that of our bank) to pay cash dividends, reduce our profitability, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to federal banking capital regulations. These regulations, among other things, establish minimum requirements to qualify as a \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d institution. If our bank were to fail to maintain its status of \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d under the applicable regulatory capital regulations, we may be subjected to a consent agreement requiring us to bring our bank back to a \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d status. Such an agreement may impose restrictions on our activities. If we were to fail to enter into such an agreement, or fail to comply with the terms of such agreement, the Federal Reserve may impose more severe restrictions on our activities, including requiring us to cease and desist activities permitted under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The current regulatory environment is fluid, with requirements frequently being introduced or amended. It is possible that increases in regulatory capital requirements and changes in how regulatory capital is calculated could cause us to increase our capital levels by issuing additional securities that qualify as regulatory capital, thus potentially diluting our existing shareholders, or by taking other actions, such as selling assets, in order to maintain required capital ratios. We may be unable to sell some of our assets, or we may have to sell assets at a discount from market value, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nIssuance of debt securities or sales of our common stock or other securities may dilute the value of our common stock.\nWe have issued both trust preferred securities and subordinated notes. In the event of our liquidation, the holders of our debt securities would receive a distribution of our available assets before distributions are made to holders of our common stock. In many situations, our Board of Directors has the authority, without any vote of our shareholders, to issue shares of our authorized but unissued preferred or common stock, including shares authorized and unissued under our equity incentive plans. In the future, we may issue additional debt or equity securities, through public or private offerings, in order to raise additional capital. Any such issuance of equity securities would dilute the percentage of ownership interest of existing shareholders and may dilute the per share book value of the common stock. In addition, option holders under our stock-based incentive plans may exercise their options at a time when we would otherwise be able to obtain additional equity capital on more favorable terms.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and such capital may not be available when needed or at all.\nWe may need or want to raise additional capital in the future by issuing debt or equity securities to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs, particularly if our asset quality or earnings were to deteriorate significantly. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial performance. Economic conditions and any loss of confidence in financial institutions generally may increase our cost of funding and limit access to certain customary sources of capital.\nThere can be no assurance that capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets, such as a decrease in our credit rating or a decline in the confidence of equity or debt purchasers, or counterparties participating in the capital markets, may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, potentially, our liquidity. Also, if we need to raise capital in the future, we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would have to compete with those institutions for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and By-laws and the laws of the State of Michigan contain provisions that may discourage or prevent a takeover of our company and reduce any takeover premium.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and By-laws, and the corporate laws of the State of Michigan, include provisions which are designed to provide our Board of Directors with time to consider whether a hostile takeover offer is in our and our shareholders\u2019 best interest. These provisions, however, could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control. The provisions also could diminish the opportunities for a holder of our common stock to participate in tender offers, including tender offers at a price above the then-current market price for our common stock. These provisions could also prevent transactions in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices, and may limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interest.\nThe Michigan Business Corporation Act contains provisions intended to protect shareholders and prohibit or discourage various types of hostile takeover activities. In addition to these provisions and the provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and By-laws, federal law requires the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s approval prior to acquiring \u201ccontrol\u201d of a bank holding company. All of these provisions may delay or prevent a change in control without action by our shareholders and could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThere is a limited trading market for our common stock.\nThe price of our common stock has been, and will likely continue to be, subject to fluctuations based on, among other things, economic and market conditions for bank holding companies and the stock market in general, as well as changes in investor perceptions of our company. The issuance of new shares of our common stock also may affect the market for our common stock.\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cMBWM.\u201d The development and maintenance of an active public trading market depends upon the existence of willing buyers and sellers, the presence of which is beyond our control. While we are a publicly-traded company, the volume of trading activity in our stock is still relatively limited. Even if a more active market develops, there can be no assurance that such a market will continue, or that our shareholders will be able to sell their shares at or above the price at which they acquired shares.\nThe value of securities in our investment securities portfolio may be negatively affected by disruptions in securities markets.\nPrices and volumes of transactions in the nation\u2019s securities markets can be affected suddenly by economic crises, or by other national or international crises, such as national disasters, acts of war or terrorism, changes in commodities markets, or instability in foreign governments. Disruptions in securities markets may detrimentally affect the value of securities that we hold in our investment portfolio, such as through reduced valuations due to the perception of heightened credit and liquidity risks. There can be no assurance that declines in market value associated with these disruptions will not result in other-than-temporary impairments of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels.", "PERMNO": 87114, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MBWM"}
