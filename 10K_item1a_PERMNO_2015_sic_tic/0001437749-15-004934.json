Additionally, the following risk factors could cause our actual results to materially differ from those reflected in any forward-looking statements.\nWe have disclosed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the prior fiscal year. Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations accurately and on a timely basis. As a result, our reliability of our financial statements could be harmed and other adverse consequences may arise.\nAs disclosed in our prior annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, we identified a material weakness in financial reporting. We believe that the material weakness has been successfully remediated as of December 31, 2014. Failure to maintain effective internal controls could lead to a misstatement of our financial statements or prevent us from filing our financial statements in a timely manner. If, as a result of deficiencies in our internal controls, we cannot provide reliable financial statements, our business decision processes may be adversely affected, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the price of our common shares could decrease and our ability to obtain additional financing, or additional financing on favorable terms, could be adversely affected. In addition, failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities.\nIf we fail to realize the expected financial results from the 2012 Dansensor acquisition, our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nIf we fail to realize the financial results as anticipated when we acquired Dansensor in 2012, then the intangibles or long-lived assets that resulted from the acquisition may be deemed \u201cimpaired.\u201d In that case, we must assess whether the amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet which relate to this acquisition exceed their fair value. Any write-down to adjust these values will reduce our reported net income and could possibly have a negative effect on our share price.\nIf economic conditions decline, companies may reduce their capital spending which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. Uncertainty about global economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses postpone spending in response to tighter credit, unemployment, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on demand for our products and services. Our customers include pharmaceutical, food, medical and chemical companies, laboratories, government agencies and public and private research institutions. The capital spending of these entities can have a significant effect on the demand for our products. Decreases in capital spending by any of these customer groups could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, business and results of operations.\nFurther, our customers\u2019 and independent representatives\u2019 ability to borrow money from their existing lenders or to obtain credit from other sources to purchase our products may be impaired. Although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and such losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same loss rates that we have in the past, especially given the current turmoil in the worldwide economy. A significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of our customers could cause unfavorable trends in our receivable collections and additional allowances may be required, which could adversely affect our operating results. If investors have concerns that our business, operating results and financial condition will be negatively impacted by a worldwide economic downturn, our share price could decrease.\nIf we violate the terms of our credit agreement and financial covenants, it could cause our lender to demand immediate repayment of our credit facilities.\nWe have a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, our primary lender, with which we entered into a secured loan and a line of credit through March 28, 2016. Our credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank includes various financial and restrictive covenants. Our current internal projections indicate that we will be in compliance with our financial and restrictive covenants for the next 12 months. However, unforeseen circumstances may develop which could result in us violating our loan covenants. If we violate the terms of our credit agreement, including our financial and restrictive covenants, Wells Fargo Bank could deem us to be in default and require us to immediately repay the entire outstanding balance of our credit facilities. If we do not have the funds available to repay the credit facilities or we cannot find another source of financing, we may fail to meet the terms of our agreement which could decrease the value of our common stock or have other material adverse consequences for us.\nSome of the markets in which we operate have experienced minimal growth in recent years, and our ability to increase our revenue will depend in part on our ability to develop new products, develop new applications for our existing products or acquire complementary businesses and product lines.\nWe have identified a number of strategies that we believe will allow us to grow our business and increase our revenue in markets experiencing minimal growth. This includes developing new products and technologies, entering new markets such as food safety, developing new applications for our technologies, acquiring complementary businesses and product lines, and strengthening our sales force. However, we can make no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these strategies, or that these strategies will result in the growth of our business or an increase in our revenue. Acquisitions that we may find attractive may be subject to the consent of Wells Fargo Bank under the credit agreement we intend to execute with them.\nIf we fail to attract and retain qualified managerial and technical personnel, we may fail to remain competitive.\nOur future success depends, in significant part, upon the continued service and performance of our senior management and other key personnel. We rely on knowledgeable, experienced and skilled technical personnel, particularly engineers, scientists and service personnel, to design, assemble, sell and service our products. The loss of the services of our management team, some of whom have significant experience in our industry, and other key personnel could impair our ability to effectively manage our company and to carry out our business plan. Our inability to attract or retain qualified personnel could have a significant negative effect and thereby materially harm our business and financial condition.\nWe face risks of technological changes that may render our products obsolete.\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by technological change and evolving industry standards. As a result of such changes and evolving standards, our products may become noncompetitive or obsolete and we may have to develop new products in order to maintain or increase our revenue. New product introductions that are responsive to these factors require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing process levels, and we may not be able to timely develop new products. In addition, industry acceptance of new technologies that we may develop may be slow due to, among other things, existing regulations or standards written specifically for older technologies and general unfamiliarity of users with new technologies. As a result, any new products that we may develop may not generate any meaningful revenue or profits for us for a number of years, if at all.\nA significant portion of our revenue is generated from foreign countries and selling in foreign countries entails a number of risks which could result in a decrease in our revenue or an increase in our operating expenses.\nRevenue outside the United States accounted for approximately 69 percent of our revenue in 2014, 67 percent in 2013 and 64 percent in 2012, and we expect that foreign revenue will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the future. Revenue to customers in foreign countries are subject to a number of risks including, among others:\n\u25cf\nagreements may be difficult to enforce;\n\u25cf\nreceivables may be difficult to collect;\n\u25cf\ncertain regions may experience political unrest and conflict and economic instability;\n\u25cf\nforeign customers may have longer payment cycles;\n\u25cf\nthe countries into which we sell may impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade;\n\u25cf\ncurrency fluctuations could reduce reported profitability in future periods;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand;\n\u25cf\nlegal and regulatory requirements may be difficult to monitor and comply with, especially if inconsistent with U.S. laws and regulations;\n\u25cf\ncustomizing products for foreign countries and managing and staffing international operations may lead to increased costs; and\n\u25cf\nprotection of intellectual property in foreign countries may be more difficult to enforce.\nIf any of these risks were to materialize, our revenue into foreign countries could decline, or our operating costs could increase, which would adversely affect our financial results.\nA portion of our revenue is derived from third party distributors and a disruption to our relationship with them could adversely impact our business. In addition, a portion of our international revenue is derived through third party distributors. As a result, we are dependent upon the financial health of our distributors. We also are dependent upon the compliance of our distributors with foreign laws and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA. If a distributor were to go out of business, it would take substantial time, cost and resources to find a suitable replacement.\nThe recent decline in the value of the Euro against the United States dollar could result in a decline in our reported revenue and earnings.\nA substantial portion of our revenue outside the United States is generated in Europe. Some of our sales in Europe are denominated in U.S. dollars. For customers that are located in Europe to whom we sell products priced in U.S. dollars, the recent decline in the value of the Euro against the United States dollar will make our products more expensive to these customers which often use their native currency (Euros) to purchase U.S. dollars to pay for our products, and the additional Euros that it will take to pay for our products is an effective price increase to these customers, which could reduce the demand or increase pressure to reduce prices by these customers for our products.\nWe also have sales to customers located in Europe and elsewhere that are denominated in Euros. For purposes of preparing our consolidated financial statements, these amounts are converted into U.S. dollars and the decrease in the value of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar means that we will receive less in U.S. dollars from the sales than before the decrease in the exchange rate, which could negatively impact our operating results. Although some of our costs are denominated in Euros which are also converted into U.S. dollars for purposes of preparing our consolidated financial statements, the reduction in costs on an as converted basis may not offset the reduction in revenue on an as converted basis which will lower our earnings.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported revenue and earnings.\nBecause the functional currency of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency, we are exposed to foreign currency transaction risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business, such as revenue to third party customers and purchases from suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. From time to time, we have elected to engage in hedging activity to mitigate our risk in this area. At December 31, 2014, there were no forward contract hedge instruments in place in our foreign operations.\nSome of our competitors have greater resources than we do, which may provide our competitors with an advantage in the development and marketing of new products.\nWe currently encounter, and expect to continue to encounter, competition in the sale of our products. We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our products include product quality and performance, price, reliability and customer service. Our competitors include large multinational corporations. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can. In addition, competition could increase if new companies enter the market or if existing competitors expand their product lines or intensify efforts within existing product lines. Our current products, products under development and our ability to discover new technologies may be insufficient to enable us to compete effectively with our competitors.\nOur reliance upon patents, domestic trademark laws, trade secrets and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property from others who may sell similar products.\nWe hold patents relating to various aspects of our products and believe that proprietary technical know-how is critical to many of our products. Proprietary rights relating to our products are protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are maintained in confidence as trade secrets. We cannot be certain that we will be issued any patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us or that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad enough to protect our technology. In the absence of patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products or gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary know-how. Our competitors may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents, or they may use their resources to design comparable products that do not infringe our patents. We may incur substantial costs if our competitors initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents or if we initiate any proceedings to protect our proprietary rights. If the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. There may also be pending or issued patents held by parties not affiliated with us that relate to our products or technologies and we may need to acquire licenses to any such patents to continue selling some or all of our products. If we are required to obtain any such license in order to be able to continue to sell some or all of our products, we may not be able to do so on terms that are favorable to us, if at all.\nIn addition, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. Even if these confidentiality agreements are not breached, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past, and will likely continue to do so in the future, and any broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past, closing prices ranging from a high of $18.50 and a low of $13.00 during 2014. Several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. Some of these factors include:\n\u25cf\nannouncements of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nquarterly fluctuations in our financial results;\n\u25cf\nmerger and acquisition activity in our industry segment;\n\u25cf\ncustomer contract awards;\n\u25cf\na change to the rates at which we have historically paid dividends, which could be impacted by our credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank;\n\u25cf\nchanges in regulation; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and political conditions in the various markets where our products are sold.\nIn addition, the share prices of instrumentation companies have experienced significant fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. This market volatility may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nComplying with securities laws and regulations is costly for us.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including regulations promulgated by the SEC and Nasdaq, are creating particular challenges for smaller publicly-held companies like us. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nIf we experience any increase in the cost of raw materials or supplies, we may experience a decrease in profit margins.\nIn the past, the overall cost of the materials that we purchase has not risen much more than the rate of inflation. We believe that the price of our products and the prices of our competitors\u2019 products is a significant factor affecting our customers\u2019 buying decisions and consequently, we may not be able to pass along any cost increases in raw materials and supplies in the form of price increases or sustain profit margins that we have achieved in prior years.\nWe have spent significant resources to develop new products, and the realized revenue from these products may be minimal for a time frame after each new product is being introduced to the marketplace.\nOver the past three to five years we began to market new products including next generation of existing products. We believe that there are significant markets for our new products and while we believe these products are superior in many respects to similar products being sold by our competitors, each one is new to the marketplace and may not gain the market acceptance necessary to allow us to capitalize on what we believe will be an increasing demand in the industries for which products are utilized. While we have realized increasing revenue of products introduced in the marketplace historically, there can be no assurance that revenue of these products will continue. While we believe our recent new product offerings represent a dramatic improvement over existing technology being used in the respective applications, for some of them, we have not realized significant revenue to date.\nIf we are not able to successfully market new products, we will not recover the significant research and development and other expenses we have incurred to bring these products to market.\nDeclining oil prices may result in decreased revenue in our Industrial Analyzers and Other segment.\nIncreased oil and gas drilling activity in recent periods has been a positive driver for our revenue of monitoring instruments. Worldwide oil prices have recently declined which may lead to a decrease in drilling and other exploration activities, which could negatively affect demand for our gas analyzers, sensors and detectors. A decrease in oil prices may also lead to our customers decreasing capital spending in anticipation of decreased profitability which could also negatively affect demand for these products. Our Industrial Analyzers and Other segment has experienced strong revenue growth in recent periods and if revenue growth was to slow or if revenue in this segment were to decline, our share price could decline.", "PERMNO": 54675, "SIC": 3829, "TIC": "MOCO"}
