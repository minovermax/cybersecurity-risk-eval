{"cik": "1533924", "company": "Midstates Petroleum Company, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following risks, or any risk described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in our other public filings, press releases and discussions with our management actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. The risks described below are the known material risk factors facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial also may adversely affect us or our operations.\nRisks Related to the Oil and Gas Industry and Our Business\nThe recent declines in oil and, to a lesser extent, NGL and natural gas prices have adversely affected our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our future capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.\nThe price we receive for our oil and, to a lesser extent, NGLs and natural gas, heavily influences our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Oil, NGLs and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for these commodities have been volatile, and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, especially given current economic and geopolitical conditions. During the period from January 1, 2014 through January 31, 2017, the WTI spot price for oil declined from a high of $107.95 per Bbl on June 20, 2014 to $26.19 per Bbl on February 11, 2016, and the Henry Hub spot price for natural gas has declined from a high of $8.15 per MMBtu on February 10, 2014 to a low of $1.49 per MMBtu on March 4, 2016. These markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future.\nThe prices we receive for our production and the levels of our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 worldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u2022 the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;\n\u2022 the price and quantity of imports of foreign oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u2022 political conditions in or affecting other oil, NGL and natural gas-producing countries;\n\u2022 the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production;\n\u2022 the level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022 localized supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability;\n\u2022 weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022 foreign, domestic and local governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u2022 speculation as to the future price of oil, NGLs and natural gas and the speculative trading of oil, NGLs and natural gas futures contracts;\n\u2022 price and availability of competitors' supplies of oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u2022 technological advances affecting energy consumption; and\n\u2022 the price and availability of alternative fuels.\nThe majority of our oil production and a portion of our natural gas production is currently sold to purchasers under short-term (less than 12-month) contracts at market based prices. The speed and severity of the decline in oil prices during 2015 and the continued lower prices throughout 2016 adversely affected our cash flows, borrowing ability and the present value of our reserves. Lower oil,\nNGL and natural gas prices may also reduce the amount of oil, NGLs and natural gas that we can produce economically. Any sustained periods of low prices for oil, NGL and natural gas prices could render uneconomic a significant portion of our identified drilling locations. This may result in our having to make significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves. As a result, a low commodity price environment and price volatility may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures.\nWe recently emerged from bankruptcy, which could adversely affect our business and relationships.\nIt is possible that our having filed for bankruptcy protection and our recent emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases could adversely affect our business and relationships with our customers, vendors, royalty or working interest owners, contractors, employees or suppliers. Due to these uncertainties, many risks exist, including the following:\n\u2022 key suppliers or vendors could terminate their relationship with us or require additional financial assurances or enhanced performance from us;\n\u2022 the ability to renew existing contracts may be adversely affected;\n\u2022 the ability to attract, motivate and/or retain key executives and employees may be adversely affected;\n\u2022 employees may be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other employment opportunities; and\n\u2022 landowners may not be willing to lease acreage to us.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and reputation. We cannot assure you that having been subject to bankruptcy protection will not adversely affect our operations in the future.\nOur Exit Facility contains certain covenants that may inhibit our ability to make certain investments, incur additional indebtedness and engage in certain other transactions, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our future goals.\nThe Exit Facility limits our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022 incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022 incur liens;\n\u2022 enter into sale and lease back transactions;\n\u2022 make certain investments;\n\u2022 make certain capital expenditures;\n\u2022 consolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022 pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our stock;\n\u2022 enter into transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022 engage or enter into any new lines of business;\n\u2022 enter into certain marketing activities for hydrocarbons;\n\u2022 create additional subsidiaries;\n\u2022 prepay, redeem, or repurchase certain of our indebtedness; and\n\u2022 amend or modify certain provisions of our (and Midstates Sub's) organizational documents.\nThe Exit Facility also requires us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants as discussed above. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our Exit Facility. If a default occurs, the lenders under the Exit Facility may elect to declare all borrowings thereunder outstanding, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under the Exit Facility would also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. If we are unable to repay our indebtedness when due or declared due, the lenders thereunder will also have the right to proceed against the collateral pledged to them to secure the indebtedness. If such indebtedness were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full our secured indebtedness.\nUpon our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, the composition of our board of directors changed significantly.\nPursuant to the Plan, the composition of the board of directors changed significantly. The new directors have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served on the Board and, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine our future. There is no guarantee that the new board of directors will pursue, or will pursue in the same manner, our current strategic plans. As a result, the future strategy and our plans may differ materially from those of the past.\nThe ability to attract and retain key personnel is critical to the success of our business and may be affected by our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases.\nThe success of our business depends on key personnel. The ability to attract and retain these key personnel may be difficult in light of our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, the uncertainties currently facing the business and changes we may make to the organizational structure to adjust to changing circumstances. We may need to enter into retention or other arrangements that could be costly to maintain. If executives, managers or other key personnel resign, retire or are terminated, or their service is otherwise interrupted, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner and we could experience significant declines in productivity.\nWe may be unable to obtain funding in the capital markets on terms we find acceptable, or our borrowings base may be subject to downward redeterminations in the future.\nHistorically, we have used our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our RBL to fund our capital expenditures and have relied on the capital markets and asset monetization transactions to provide us with additional capital for large or exceptional transactions or to refinance debt obligations. On the Effective Date, the existing RBL was superseded, and we entered into the Exit Facility with the lenders under the existing RBL. The Exit Facility has an initial borrowing base of $170.0 million with no borrowing base redeterminations to occur until April 2018 (provided certain conditions are met) and semiannual borrowing base redeterminations thereafter. Any reduction in the borrowing base will reduce our available liquidity, and, if the reduction results in the outstanding amount under the facility exceeding the borrowing base, we will be required to repay the deficiency within 30 days or in six equal monthly installments thereafter, at our election. We may not have the financial resources in the future to make any mandatory deficiency principal prepayments required under our Exit Facility, which could result in an event of default.\nIn the future, we may not be able to access adequate funding under our Exit Facility as a result of (i) a decrease in our borrowing base due to the outcome of a subsequent borrowing base redetermination, or (ii) an unwillingness or inability on the part of our lending counterparties to meet their funding obligations. Since the process for determining the borrowing base under our Exit Facility\ninvolves evaluating the estimated value of some of our oil and natural gas properties using pricing models determined by the lenders at that time, a decline in those prices used, or further downward reductions of our reserves, likely will result in a redetermination of our borrowing base and a decrease in the available borrowing amount at the time of the next scheduled redetermination. In such case, we would be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the borrowing base.\nOur level of indebtedness may increase and reduce our financial flexibility.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $130.0 million outstanding under our Exit Facility, including $1.9 million in letters of credit. We may incur a significant amount of additional indebtedness in the future. Should our current level of indebtedness increase significantly, it could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u2022 causing a significant portion of our cash flows to be used to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flows for working capital, capital expenditures and other general business activities;\n\u2022 increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022 limiting our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;\n\u2022 placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and, therefore, such competitors may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness would prevent us from pursuing;\n\u2022 causing our debt covenants to affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry;\n\u2022 making it more likely that a reduction in our borrowing base following a redetermination could require us to repay a portion of our then outstanding bank borrowings; and\n\u2022 impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes.\nA high level of indebtedness would increase the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance. General economic conditions, oil, NGL and natural gas prices and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control.\nWe may be unable to maintain compliance with certain financial ratio covenants of our outstanding indebtedness which could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Exit Facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios or to reduce our indebtedness if we are unable to comply with such ratios, including an EBITDA to interest expense coverage ratio limitation of 3.00:1.00, a ratio limitation of Total Net Indebtedness (as defined in the Exit Facility) to EBITDA of not more than 2.25:1.00 through April 1, 2018 and not more than 3.00:1.00 thereafter, and a capital expenditure limitation of $50.0 million for the 6 months ended December 31, 2016, $81.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $85.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $78.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, after April 2018 (unless the borrowing base is redetermined earlier), we must maintain liquidity (cash plus available commitments) equal to at least 20.0% of the effective borrowing base.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with our financial covenants; however, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to comply with such terms at all times in the future. Any failure to comply with the conditions and covenants in our Exit Facility that is not waived by our lenders or otherwise cured could lead to a termination of our Exit Facility, acceleration of all amounts due under our Exit Facility, or trigger cross default provisions under other financing arrangements. These restrictions may limit our ability to obtain future financings to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations that the restrictive covenants under our indebtedness impose on us.\nOur historical financial information may not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nOn the effective date of our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases on October 21, 2016, we adopted fresh start accounting, as a consequence of which our assets and liabilities were adjusted to fair values and our accumulated deficit was restated to zero. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations following our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases may not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements. Further, as a result of the implementation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby, our historical financial information may not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our development, drilling and production activities. Our oil and natural gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil or natural gas production. Our decisions to purchase, explore or develop drilling locations or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through 2D and 3D seismic data, geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. The production and operating data that is available with respect to our operating areas based on modern drilling and completion techniques is relatively limited compared to trends where multiple operators have been active for a significant period of time. As a result, we face more uncertainty in evaluating data than operators in more developed trends. Our costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain before drilling commences. In addition, the application of new techniques in these trends, such as high-graded stimulation designs and horizontal completions, may make it more difficult to accurately estimate these costs. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical. Further, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel our scheduled drilling projects, including the following:\n\u2022 shortages of, or delays in, obtaining equipment and qualified personnel;\n\u2022 facility or equipment malfunctions;\n\u2022 unexpected operational events;\n\u2022 ability to economically dispose of produced saltwater;\n\u2022 pressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022 adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022 reductions in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022 delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 proximity to and capacity of transportation facilities;\n\u2022 title problems;\n\u2022 limitations in the market for oil and natural gas; and\n\u2022 cost associated with developing and operating oil and gas properties.\nIn addition, our hydraulic fracturing operations require significant quantities of water. Regions where we operate have recently experienced drought conditions. These conditions could persist in the future, diminishing our access to water for hydraulic fracturing operations. Any diminished access to water for use in hydraulic fracturing, whether due to usage restrictions or drought or other weather conditions, could curtail our operations or otherwise result in delays in operations or increased costs.\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will not be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nYou should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements in effect at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we based the discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the preceding twelve months without giving effect to derivative transactions. Actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022 actual prices we receive for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022 actual cost of development and production expenditures;\n\u2022 the amount and timing of actual production; and\n\u2022 changes in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenues from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating standardized measure may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimates included in this report which could have a material effect on the market value of our reserves.\nDue to the recent decrease in oil and natural gas prices and if prices decrease in the future, we may be required to take further write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties.\nWe use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties. Accordingly, we capitalize and amortize all productive and nonproductive costs directly associated with property acquisition, exploration and development activities. Under the full cost method, the capitalized cost of oil and gas properties, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes may not exceed the \"cost center ceiling\" which is equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves, less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves computed using a discount factor of 10%, plus the costs of properties not subject to amortization, plus the lower of the cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, less related income tax effects. If the net capitalized costs exceed the cost center ceiling, we recognize the excess as an impairment of oil and gas properties. The risk that we will be required to recognize impairments of our oil and natural gas properties increases during\nperiods of low commodity prices. In addition, impairments would occur if we were to experience sufficient downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or the present value of estimated future net revenues. An impairment recognized in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even if higher oil and gas prices increase the cost center ceiling applicable to the subsequent period. We could incur impairments of oil and natural gas properties in the future, particularly as a result of future declines in commodity prices.\nOil, NGL and natural gas prices are volatile and a portion of our production is not subject to hedging. As a result, a portion of our cash flows from operations will be subjected to increased volatility.\nHistorically, we have entered into hedging transactions of our oil, NGL and natural gas production to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of oil, NGLs and natural gas. At December 31, 2016, we had no outstanding commodity derivative contracts, although we entered into various derivatives subsequent to December 31, 2016 for a portion of our expected 2017 and first quarter 2018 production. As such, a portion of our 2017 and 2018 production will be sold at market prices, leaving us exposed to the fluctuations in the price of oil, NGLs and natural gas and subjecting our cash flows from operations to increased volatility unless we enter into additional hedging transactions. We will continually reevaluate and consider whether in the long-term we will hedge any of our future production.\nAny future derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our earnings.\nTo achieve a more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil, NGL and natural gas, we have historically chosen to enter into derivative instruments at times for a portion of our oil, NGL and natural gas production. We do not designate derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes, and we record all derivative instruments in our balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognized in current earnings. Accordingly, to the extent we enter into derivative instruments in the future, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments.\nDerivative instruments would expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u2022 production is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments;\n\u2022 the counter-party to the derivative instrument defaults on its contractual obligations; or\n\u2022 there is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received for basis differentials.\nIn addition, any derivative arrangements in the future would likely limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil, NGLs and natural gas.\nWe have incurred losses from operations during certain periods historically and may continue to do so in the future.\nWe incurred a net loss of $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our development of, and participation in, an increasing number of drilling locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures. The uncertainty and risks described in this report may impede our ability to economically acquire and develop oil and natural gas reserves. As a result, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows provided by operating activities in the future.\nOur estimated proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these assumptions will materially affect the quantities and estimated present value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to current and future economic conditions and commodity prices. Any significant inaccuracies in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this report. See \"Summary of Oil and Gas Properties and Operations\" for information about our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nIn order to prepare our estimates, we must estimate production rates and the timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise. In addition, reserve estimates for properties that do not have a lengthy production history, including the areas in which we operate, are less reliable than estimates for fields with lengthy production histories. There can be no assurance that analysis of previous production data relating to the Mississippian Lime or Anadarko Basins will accurately predict future production, development expenditures or operating expenses from wells drilled and completed using modern techniques. In addition, this data is partially based on vertically drilled wells, which may not accurately reflect production, development expenditures or operating expenses that may result from the application of horizontal drilling techniques.\nActual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this report. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe development of our undeveloped reserves in our areas of operation may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nDevelopment of these reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Delays in the development of our reserves or increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves will reduce the future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, pursuant to existing SEC rules and guidance, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking. Accordingly, delays in the development of such reserves, increases in capital expenditures required to develop such reserves and changes in commodity prices may cause us to reclassify certain of our proved undeveloped reserves as unproved reserves, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnless we conduct successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary\ndepending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our cash flows and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, the value of our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nOur producing properties are located in the Mississippian Lime and in the Anadarko Basin, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a limited number of geographic areas.\nAll of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Mississippian Lime and Anadarko Basin, and at December 31, 2016, all of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in these areas. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in these areas caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, availability of equipment and personnel, water shortages or other drought related conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, NGLs or natural gas.\nDrilling locations that we have identified may not yield oil, NGLs or natural gas in commercially viable quantities.\nWe describe some of our drilling locations and our plans to explore those drilling locations in this report. Our drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from a location which is ready to drill to a location that will require substantial additional interpretation. It is extremely difficult to accurately predict with any level of certainty in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. The use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable. Even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist, we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well, resulting in a reduction in production from or abandonment of the well. If we drill additional wells that we identify as dry holes in our current and future drilling locations, our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business. In sum, the cost of drilling, completing and operating any well is often uncertain, and new wells may not be productive.\nOur identified drilling locations are scheduled out over many years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling, which in certain instances could prevent production prior to the expiration date of leases for such locations. In addition, we may not be able to raise or have reasonable access to the amount of capital that would be necessary to drill a substantial portion of our identified drilling locations.\nOur management team has identified and scheduled certain drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage and acreage currently under option. These drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these drilling locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, the availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, infrastructure and/or downstream constraints, regulatory approvals and other factors. Because of these uncertain factors, we do not know if the numerous drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil\nor natural gas from these or any other drilling locations. In addition, unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the potential locations are obtained, the leases for such acreage could expire. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified.\nPart of our strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques. The results of our horizontal drilling activities are subject to drilling and completion technique risks, and actual drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production. As a result, the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline if drilling results are unsuccessful.\nRisks that we face while horizontally drilling include, but are not limited to, landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone, staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation, running our casing the entire length of the well bore and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore. Risks that we face while completing our horizontal wells include, but are not limited to, being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, being able to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations and successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage. Ultimately, the success of these horizontal drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled in the Mississippian Lime and Anadarko Basin and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our horizontal drilling results in these trends are less than anticipated, the return on our investment in this area may not be as attractive as we anticipate and the value of our undeveloped acreage in this area could decline.\nOur business depends on the availability of water and the ability to dispose of water. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to obtain or dispose of water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWith current technology, water is an essential component of drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle water after use or its production, could adversely impact our operations. In some cases, water may need to be obtained from new sources and transported to drilling sites, resulting in increased costs. Moreover, the introduction of new environmental initiatives and regulations related to water acquisition, water use or waste water disposal, including produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of hydrocarbons, could limit or prohibit our ability to utilize hydraulic fracturing or waste water injection disposal wells.\nIn addition, concerns have been raised about the potential for earthquakes to occur from the use of underground injection disposal wells, a predominant method for disposing of waste water from oil and gas activities. As further discussed in the risk factor below, new rules and regulations may be developed to address these concerns, possibly limiting or eliminating the ability to use disposal wells in certain locations and/or injecting into certain formations, thereby increasing the cost of disposal in our operations. We operate our own injection wells in addition to using injection wells owned by third parties to dispose of waste water associated with our operations.\nCompliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage, and use of water necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells or the disposal of water may increase our operating costs or may cause us to delay, curtail or discontinue our exploration and development plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLegislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity could restrict our ability to dispose of saltwater produced in conjunction with our hydrocarbons, which could limit our ability to produce oil and gas economically and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe dispose of large volumes of saltwater produced in conjunction with the oil and natural gas produced from our drilling and production operations pursuant to permits issued to us by governmental authorities overseeing such disposal activities. While these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations, the applicable legal requirements may be subject to change, which could result in the imposition of more stringent operating constraints or new monitoring and reporting requirements.\nAs stated above under \"Water Discharges and Fluid Injection\", the adoption and implementation of any new laws, regulations, or directives that restrict our ability to dispose of saltwater by plugging back the depths of disposal wells, reducing the volume of oil and natural gas wastewater disposed in such wells, restricting disposal well locations, or requiring us to shut down disposal wells, could require the Company to cease operations at a substantial number of its oil and natural gas wells, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce oil and gas economically and, accordingly, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe unavailability or high cost of additional drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within our budget and on a timely basis.\nWe utilize third-party services to maximize the efficiency of our organization. The cost of oilfield services may increase or decrease depending on the demand for services by other oil and gas companies. There is no assurance that we will be able to contract for such services on a timely basis or that the cost of such services will remain at a satisfactory or affordable level. Shortages or the high cost of frac crews, drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel or oilfield services could delay or adversely affect our development and exploration operations or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business depends on transportation by truck for our oil and condensate production, and our natural gas production depends on transportation facilities that are owned by third parties.\nWe transport all of our oil and condensate production by truck, which is more expensive and less efficient than transportation via pipeline. Our natural gas production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipeline systems and processing facilities owned by third parties. Federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand, pipeline pressures, damage to or destruction of pipelines and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather and transport oil and natural gas.\nThe disruption of third-party facilities due to maintenance, capacity constraints, or weather could negatively impact our ability to market and deliver our products. We have no control over when or if such facilities are restored or what prices will be charged. A total shut-in of production could materially affect us due to a lack of cash flows, and if a substantial portion of the production is hedged at lower than current market prices, those financial hedges would have to be paid from borrowings absent sufficient cash flows.\nOur drilling and production programs may not be able to obtain access on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise to truck transportation, pipelines, gas gathering, transmission, storage and processing facilities to market our oil and natural gas production.\nThe marketing of oil and natural gas production depends in large part on the capacity and availability of trucks, pipelines and storage facilities, gas gathering systems and other transportation, processing and refining facilities. Access to such facilities is, in many respects, beyond our control. If these facilities were unavailable to us on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise, we could be forced to shut in some production or delay or discontinue drilling plans and commercial production following a discovery of hydrocarbons. We rely (and expect to rely in the future) on facilities developed and owned by third parties in order to store, process, transmit and sell our oil and natural gas production. Our plans to develop and sell our oil and natural gas reserves could be materially and adversely affected by the inability or unwillingness of third parties to provide sufficient facilities and services to us on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise. The amount of oil and gas that can be produced is subject to limitation in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, physical damage to the gathering, transportation, refining or processing facilities, or lack of capacity on such facilities. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months, and in many cases, we may be provided only limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations. Additionally we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of:\n\u2022 environmental hazards, such as unauthorized releases of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including soil and groundwater contamination;\n\u2022 abnormally pressured formations;\n\u2022 mechanical difficulties, such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u2022 fires, explosions and ruptures of pipelines;\n\u2022 personal injuries and death; and\n\u2022 natural disasters.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses as a result of:\n\u2022 injury or loss of life;\n\u2022 damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022 pollution and other environmental damage;\n\u2022 regulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u2022 suspension of our operations; and\n\u2022 repair and remediation costs.\nWe may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased costs of capital could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the availability, terms and cost of capital, or increases in interest rates. Changes in any one or more of these factors could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our access to capital, limit our ability to drill our identified locations and pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce our cash flows available for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage. Continuing volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability, impacting our ability to finance our operations. We require continued access to capital. A significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results.\nThe inability of our significant purchasers to meet their obligations to us may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to credit risk due to concentration of our oil, NGL and natural gas receivables with several significant purchasers. We generally do not require our purchasers to post collateral. The inability or failure of any of our significant purchasers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nLarge competitors may be attracted to our core operating areas, which may increase our costs.\nOur operations in the Mississippian Lime formation in northwestern Oklahoma and the Anadarko Basin in the Texas panhandle and western Oklahoma may attract companies that have greater resources than we do. These companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or identify, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. Their presence in our areas of operations may also restrict our access to, or increase the cost of, oil and natural gas infrastructure, drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services, including fracking equipment and crews. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas prices. Our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. See \"Business-Competition\" for additional discussion of the competitive environment in which we operate.\nTitle to the properties in which we have an interest may be impaired by title defects.\nWe do not obtain title insurance and have not necessarily obtained drilling title opinions on all of our oil and natural gas properties. The existence of title deficiencies with respect to our oil and natural gas properties could reduce the value or render such properties worthless, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. A portion of our acreage is undeveloped leasehold acreage, which has a greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. Frequently, as a result of title examinations, certain curative work may be required to correct identified title defects, and such curative work entails time and expense. Our inability or failure to cure title defects could render some locations undrillable or cause us to lose our rights to some or all production from some of our oil and natural gas properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results if a comparable additional location to drill a development well cannot be identified.\nFuture legislation may result in the elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production. Additionally, future federal or state legislation may impose new or increased taxes or fees on oil and natural gas extraction, transportation and sales.\nPotential legislation, if enacted into law, could make significant changes to U.S. federal and state income tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities, and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of this legislation or any other similar changes in U.S. federal and state income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, legislation could be enacted that increases the taxes states impose on oil and natural gas extraction. Moreover, former President Obama proposed, as part of the Budget of the United States Government for Fiscal Year 2017, to impose an \"oil fee\" of $10.25 on a per barrel equivalent of crude oil. This fee would be collected on domestically produced and imported petroleum products. The fee would be phased in evenly over five years. The adoption of this, or similar proposals, could result in increased operating costs and/or reduced consumer demand for petroleum products, which in turn could affect the prices we receive for our oil.\nWe are subject to various governmental regulations that may cause us to incur substantial costs.\nFrom time to time, in varying degrees, political developments and federal and state laws and regulations affect our operations. In particular, price controls, taxes and other laws relating to the oil and natural gas industry, changes in these laws and changes in administrative regulations have affected, and in the future could affect, oil and natural gas production, operations and economics. We cannot predict how agencies or courts will interpret existing laws and regulations or the effect these adoptions and interpretations may have on our business or financial condition.\nOur business is subject to laws and regulations promulgated by federal, state and local authorities relating to the exploration for, and the development, production and marketing of, oil and natural gas, as well as safety matters. Legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. We may be required to make significant expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations. The discharge of oil, natural gas or other pollutants into the air, soil or water may give rise to significant liabilities on our part to the government and third parties and may require us to incur substantial costs of remediation.\nOur sales of oil and natural gas may expose us to extensive regulation.\nThe FERC, the CFTC and the FTC hold statutory authority to monitor certain segments of the physical energy commodities markets relevant to our business. These agencies have imposed broad regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation of such markets. With regard to our physical sales, if any, of oil, NGLs and natural gas, we are required to observe the market-related regulations enforced by these agencies.\nOur operations are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration, production and development operations are subject to numerous stringent and complex federal, regional, state, local and other laws and regulations relating to pollution and protection of the environment, including those governing the release or disposal of materials into the environment. Potentially applicable environmental laws include, but are not limited to, (i) the CERCLA, and analogous state laws, which regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or locations to which we have sent wastes for disposal; (ii) the CWA and analogous state laws, which regulate the discharge of waste and storm waters from some of our facilities; (iii) the CAA, and analogous state laws, which impose obligations related to air emissions, including emissions limits and permitting requirements; (iv) the RCRA, and analogous state laws, which impose requirements for the handling and disposal of solid or hazardous waste; (v) the Endangered Species Act, and analogous state laws, which seek to ensure that activities do not jeopardize endangered animal, fish and plant species; (vi) the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to study potential environmental impacts of a proposed federal action before it is approved; and (vii) OSHA, and analogous state laws, which establish certain employer responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards. These laws and regulations may, among other things, require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, require the maintenance of bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, restrict the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling, completion and production activities, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, and other protected areas, impose specific standards for the plugging and abandoning of wells and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. We may be required to make significant capital and operating expenditures to prevent releases, manage wastewater discharges and control air emissions or perform remedial or other corrective actions at our wells and properties to comply with the requirements of these environmental laws and regulations or the terms or conditions of permits issued pursuant to such requirements. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, loss of our leases, incurrence of investigatory or remedial obligations and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations.\nThere is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations due to our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and other hazardous substances and wastes, as a result of air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations, and because of historical operations and waste disposal practices at our leased, operated and owned properties. Spills or other releases of regulated substances, including such spills and releases that occur in the future, could expose us to material losses, expenditures and liabilities or remedial obligations under applicable environmental laws and regulations. Under certain of such laws and regulations, we could be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination, regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination and even if our operations met previous standards in the industry or complied with existing applicable laws at the time they were conducted.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly well drilling, construction, completion or water management activities, air emissions control or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our industry in general in addition to our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. For example, the EPA published a final rule on October 1, 2015 that reduces the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone to between 65 and 70 ppb for\nboth the 8-hour primary and secondary standards. In addition, in May 2016, the EPA finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and natural gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements. In May 2016, the EPA also issued final rules that require the reduction of volatile organic compound and methane emissions from additional new, modified or reconstructed oil and gas emissions sources. Since the methane and aggregation rules were published in the Federal Register after May 31, 2016, they are potentially subject to repeal by the new Congress. Compliance with these or other new regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact our business.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce.\nBased on the EPA's determination that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to warming of the earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA to address GHG emissions. For example, the EPA has adopted regulations that establish pre-construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that already are potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet \"best available control technology\" standards that typically will be established by the states. In addition, the EPA has adopted regulations requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHGs from certain sources in the United States, including, among others, certain onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities. Most recently, in May 2016, the EPA finalized rules to reduce methane emissions from new, modified or reconstructed sources in the oil and natural gas sector. In November 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\") issued final rules to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and gas operations on public lands. The May 2016 and November 2016 methane rules are potentially subject to repeal by the new Congress.\nIn addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs and a number of states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. On an international level, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that is party to the Paris Agreement adopted in December 2015 to reduce global GHG emissions. It is not possible at this time to predict if or when the United States might impose restrictions on GHG emissions as a result of this agreement. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs and could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs, additional operating restrictions or delays, which could adversely affect our production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We routinely utilize hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our oil and natural gas drilling and completion programs. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions or similar state agencies, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the use of diesel fuel in fracturing operations; issued final CAA regulations governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing; issued in June 2016 final effluent limit guidelines that saltwater from shale resource extraction operations must meet before discharging to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants; and issued in May 2014 a prepublication of its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. The air emissions standards issued in May 2016 and the effluent limit guidelines issued in June 2016 are potentially subject to repeal by the new Congress. Also, the BLM published a final rule containing disclosure requirements and other mandates for hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands in March of 2015. However, the U.S. District Court of Wyoming struck down this rule in June 2016; the ruling is currently on appeal before the U.S. Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. Compliance with these requirements could increase our costs of development and production, which costs may be significant.\nFrom time to time, Congress has considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. Moreover, some states, including Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma, where we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations under certain circumstances, or that prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether. In addition, local government may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, and experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves. In addition, there are also certain governmental reviews underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices which could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act (\"SDWA\") or otherwise.\nOur operations are dependent on our rights and ability to receive or renew the required permits and other approvals from governmental authorities and other third parties.\nPerformance of our operations requires that we obtain and maintain numerous environmental, water access and land use permits and other approvals authorizing our regulated activities. We must renew these permits and approvals periodically, and the permits and approvals may be modified or revoked by the issuing agency. A decision by a governmental authority or other third party to deny, delay or restrictively condition the issuance of a new or renewed permit or other approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or other approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to initiate or continue operations at the affected location or facility. Expansion of our\nexisting operations is also predicated on securing the necessary environmental, water access or land use permits and other approvals, which we may not receive in a timely manner or at all.\nThe adoption of financial reform legislation by Congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nIn July 2010, new comprehensive financial reform legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"DF Act\"), was enacted that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The DF Act requires the CFTC, the SEC and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the DF Act. Although the CFTC has finalized certain regulations, others remain to be finalized or implemented and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished.\nIn one of its rulemaking proceedings still pending under the DF Act, the CFTC issued on December 5, 2016, re-proposed rules imposing position limits for certain futures and option contracts in various commodities (including oil and gas) and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Under the proposed rules on position limits, certain types of hedging transactions are exempt from these limits on the size of positions that may be held, provided that such hedging transactions satisfy the CFTC's requirements for certain enumerated \"bona fide hedging\" transactions or positions. As these new position limit rules are not yet final, the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time.\nThe CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and the associated rules also will require us in connection with covered derivatives activities to comply with clearing and trade-execution requirements or take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements. Although the Company expects to qualify for the end-user exception from the mandatory clearing requirements for swaps entered to hedge its commercial risks, the application of the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that the Company uses for hedging. In addition, for uncleared swaps, the CFTC or federal banking regulators may require end-users to enter into credit support documentation and/or post initial and variation margins. Posting of collateral could impact liquidity and reduce cash available to the Company for its needs. The DF Act may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties.\nThe full impact of the DF Act and related regulatory requirements upon the Company's business will not be known until the regulations are implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. The DF Act and regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties or reduce liquidity. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the DF Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.\nFinally, the DF Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the DF Act is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nThe exercise of all or any number of outstanding warrants or the issuance of stock-based awards may dilute your holding of shares of our common stock.\nPursuant to the Plan, we issued 24,994,867 shares of common stock in the reorganized Company, 4,411,765 warrants with a strike price of $24.00 per common share of the reorganized equity and 2,213,789 warrants with a strike price of $46.00 per common share of the reorganized equity. Additionally, a total of 3,513,950 shares of common stock of the reorganized equity are reserved for issuance under the 2016 LTIP as equity-based awards to employees, directors and certain other persons. The exercise of equity awards, including any stock options that we may grant in the future, and warrants, and the sale of shares of our common stock underlying any such options or the warrants, could have an adverse effect on the market for our common stock, including the price that an investor could obtain for their shares. Investors may experience dilution in the net tangible book value of their investment upon the exercise of the warrants and any stock options that may be granted or issued pursuant to the 2016 LTIP in the future.\nThe price and trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price at which you were granted your shares of common stock or above the price you paid to acquire your shares of common stock. The market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, including:\n\u2022 our new capital structure as a result of the transactions contemplated by the Plan;\n\u2022 our limited trading history subsequent to our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022 our limited trading volume;\n\u2022 the concentration of holdings of our common stock;\n\u2022 the lack of comparable historical financial information due to our adoption of fresh start accounting;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated variations in our operating results and cash flow;\n\u2022 the nature and content of our earnings releases, announcements or events that impact our products, customers, competitors or markets; and\n\u2022 business conditions in our markets and the general state of the securities markets and the market for energy-related stocks, as well as general economic and market conditions.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market or the issuance of securities senior to our common stock, or the perception that these sales may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in stock offerings.\nA large percentage of our shares of common stock are held by a relatively small number of investors. Further, we entered into a registration rights agreement with certain of those investors pursuant to which we filed a registration statement with the SEC to facilitate potential future sales of such shares by them. Sales by us or our stockholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public markets, or even the perception that these sales might occur (such as upon the filing of the aforementioned registration statement), could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or could impair our ability to raise capital through a future sale of, or pay for acquisitions using, our equity securities.\nWe are currently authorized to issue 250,000,000 shares of common stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding approximately 24,994,867 shares of common stock and warrants and options to purchase an aggregate of 6,625,554 shares of our common stock. We have also reserved an additional 3,513,950 shares for issuance under the 2016 LTIP. The potential issuance of such additional shares of common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may issue common stock or other equity securities senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance acquisitions, to adjust our leverage ratio, and to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of warrants and options, or for other reasons. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales or issuances of shares of our common stock or other equity securities, or the availability of shares of common stock or such other equity securities for future sale or issuance, will have on the trading price of our common stock.\nThere may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant stockholders could be in conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2016, funds advised by Avenue Capital Group, Centerbridge Partners and Fir Tree Partners held approximately 13.98%, 18.33% and 25.58%, respectively, of our post-reorganization common stock. Circumstances may arise in which these stockholders may have an interest in pursuing or preventing acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions, including the issuance of additional shares or debt, that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us or another company in which they invest. Such transactions might adversely affect us or other holders of our common stock. In addition, our significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common shares because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with significant stockholders.", "PERMNO": 16442, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "AMPY"}
