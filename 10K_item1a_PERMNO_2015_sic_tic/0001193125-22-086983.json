The following highlights some of the factors that have affected, and/or in the future could affect, the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe following is a summary of certain important factors that may make an investment in iCAD speculative or risky. You should carefully consider the fuller risk factor disclosure set forth in this Annual Report, in addition to the other information herein, including the section of this report titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the Company\u2019s financial statements and related notes.\n\u2022\nThe Company has incurred significant losses from inception through 2021 and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and sustain future profitability.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s quarterly and annual operating and financial results and gross margins are likely to fluctuate significantly in future periods.\n\u2022\nManagement expects the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)\npandemic to continue to have a significant effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. A continuation or worsening of the pandemic will have a material adverse impact on iCAD\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition and on the market price of iCAD\u2019s common stock.\n\u2022\nThe markets for the Company\u2019s products and treatments and newly introduced enhancements to iCAD\u2019s existing products and treatments may not develop as expected, the Company may continue to face barriers to broad market acceptance.\n\u2022\nSales and market acceptance of Company products is dependent upon the coverage and reimbursement decisions made by third-party payers, including carve-out\nradiology benefits managers. The failure of third-party payers to provide appropriate levels of coverage and reimbursement, and/or meeting prior authorization and other requirements for approval to use Company products and treatments facilitated by the Company\u2019s products could harm the Company\u2019s business and prospects.\n\u2022\nA limited number of customers account for a significant portion of the Company\u2019s total revenue. The loss of a principal customer could seriously hurt the Company\u2019s business.\n\u2022\nThe markets for many of the Company\u2019s products are subject to changing technology.\n\u2022\nRevenue from the Company\u2019s new subscription license model may be difficult to predict.\n\u2022\nThe Company distributes its products in highly competitive markets and the Company\u2019s sales may suffer as a result.\n\u2022\nThe Company relies on intellectual property and proprietary rights to maintain its competitive position and may not be able to protect these rights.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s future prospects depend on its ability to retain current key employees and attract additional qualified personnel.\n\u2022\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock has been, and may continue to be volatile, which could reduce the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\n\u2022\nFuture issuances of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock may cause significant dilution of equity interests of existing holders of common stock and decrease the market price of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nRisks Related to Financial Position, Operating Results and Need for Additional Capital\nThe Company has incurred significant losses from inception through 2021 and there can be no assurance that it will be able to achieve and sustain future profitability.\nThe Company has incurred significant losses since inception. The Company incurred a net loss of $11.2 million in 2021 and has an accumulated deficit of $253.1 million at December 31, 2021. The Company may not be able to achieve profitability. Substantially all of our operating losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with research and development efforts, including clinical studies, and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect our operating expenses to significantly increase as we continue to invest in research and development efforts. We also continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. As a result, we expect to continue to incur substantial and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future.\nThe Company\u2019s quarterly and annual operating and financial results and its gross margins are likely to fluctuate significantly in future periods.\nThe Company\u2019s quarterly and annual operating and financial results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period. The Company\u2019s revenue and results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors that are outside of the Company\u2019s control including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, the timing of orders from the Company\u2019s OEM partners, its OEM partners\u2019 ability to manufacture and ship their digital mammography systems, its timely receipt by the FDA for the clearance or approval to market Company products, its ability to timely engage other OEM partners for the sale of Company products, the timing of product enhancements and new product introductions by Company or its competitors, the pricing of Company products, changes in customers\u2019 budgets, changes to the economic strength of the Company\u2019s customers, economic changes in the markets served by the Company\u2019s customers, competitive conditions and the possible deferral of revenue under the Company\u2019s revenue recognition policies.\nRisks Related to the Company and its Business\nThe Company expects the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)\npandemic, including the emergence of new variants, to have a significant effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. In addition, the pandemic has resulted in significant financial market volatility, and its impact on the global economy appears to be significant. A continuation or worsening of the pandemic will have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition and on the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nAs a provider of devices and services to the health care industry, the Company\u2019s operations have been materially affected, and may continue to be impacted, by the COVID-19\npandemic. Beginning with Q1 2020 through Q4\n2021, the COVID-19\npandemic has presented a number of challenges and risks for the Company\u2019s business, including, but not limited to, decreased product demand due to reduced numbers of in-person\nmeetings with potential clients; potential clients\u2019 singular focus on surging COVID-19\ninfection rates following the emergence of the Omicron variant, causing attention to be diverted from purchasing decisions; pandemic-related public health impacts, including significant shifts in workforce availability and priorities, on customer, supplier, and iCAD\u2019s business process; supply chain interruptions; disruptions to the Company\u2019s clinical trials; challenges operating in a virtual work environment; impacts resulting from travel limitations and mobility restrictions; and other challenges presented by disruptions to the Company\u2019s normal operations in response to the pandemic, as well as uncertainties regarding the duration and severity of the pandemic on the global economy and the Company\u2019s operations, and the unpredictable and periodic emergence of new variants of the COVID-19\nvirus.\nThe COVID-19\npandemic has resulted in significant financial market volatility and uncertainty. A continued or worsening level of market disruption and volatility observed since the start of the pandemic will have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to access capital, on its business, results of operations and financial condition, and on the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. Although the Company does not provide guidance to investors relating to the Company\u2019s results of operations, the Company\u2019s quarterly results for the quarter ending March 31, 2022, and possibly future quarters, could reflect a continued negative impact from the COVID-19\npandemic for similar or additional reasons.\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to trade accounts receivable losses may increase if its customers are adversely affected by changes in healthcare laws, coverage, and reimbursement, economic pressures or uncertainty associated with local or global economic recessions, disruption associated with the current COVID-19\npandemic, or other customer-specific factors. The Company has historically not experienced significant trade account receivable losses, but it is possible that there could be a material adverse impact from potential adjustments of the carrying amount of trade account receivables as hospitals\u2019 cash flows are impacted by their response to the COVID-19\npandemic.\nThe markets for the Company\u2019s products and treatments and newly introduced enhancements to the Company\u2019s existing products and treatments may not develop as expected, the Company continues to face barriers to broad market acceptance.\nThe successful commercialization of the Company\u2019s newly developed products and treatments and newly introduced enhancements to the Company\u2019s existing products and treatments are subject to numerous risks, both known and unknown, including:\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of the Company\u2019s products;\n\u2022\nuncertainty of the development of a market for such product or treatment;\n\u2022\ntrends relating to, or the introduction or existence of, competing products, technologies or alternative treatments or therapies that may be more effective, safer or easier to use than the Company\u2019s products, technologies, treatments or therapies;\n\u2022\nthe perceptions of the Company\u2019s products or treatments as compared to other products and treatments;\n\u2022\nrecommendation and support for the use of the Company\u2019s products or treatments by influential customers, such as hospitals, radiological practices, breast surgeons and radiation oncologists and treatment centers and U.S. and international medical professional societies;\n\u2022\nthe availability and extent of data demonstrating the clinical efficacy of the Company\u2019s products or treatments;\n\u2022\ncompetition, including the presence of competing products sold by companies with longer operating histories, more recognizable names and more established distribution networks; and\n\u2022\nother technological developments.\nOften, the development of a significant market for a product or treatment will depend upon the establishment of appropriate reimbursement for use of the product or treatment. Moreover, even if addressed, such reimbursement levels frequently are not established until after a product or treatment is developed and commercially introduced, which can delay the successful commercialization of a product or treatment.\nIf the Company is unable to successfully commercialize and create a significant market for the Company\u2019s newly developed products and treatments and newly introduced enhancements to the Company\u2019s existing products and treatments, the Company\u2019s business and prospects could be harmed.\nThe Company may be exposed to significant product liability for which the Company may not have sufficient insurance coverage or be able to procure sufficient insurance coverage.\nThe Company\u2019s product and general liability insurance coverage may be inadequate with respect to potential claims and adequate insurance coverage may not be available in sufficient amounts or at a reasonable cost in the future. If available at all, product liability insurance for the medical device industry generally is expensive. Future product liability claims could be costly to defend and/or costly to resolve and could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and business.\nSales and market acceptance of the Company\u2019s products is dependent upon the coverage and reimbursement decisions made by third-party payers, including carve-out\nradiology benefits managers. The failure of third-party payers to provide appropriate levels of coverage and reimbursement, and/or meeting prior authorization and other requirements for approval to use the Company\u2019s products and treatments facilitated by the Company\u2019s products could harm the Company\u2019s business and prospects.\nSales and market acceptance of the Company\u2019s medical products and the treatments facilitated by Company products in the United States and other countries is dependent upon the coverage decisions and reimbursement policies established by government healthcare programs and private health insurers. Market acceptance of the Company\u2019s products and treatments has and will continue to depend upon the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 ability to obtain coverage for, and appropriate reimbursement from third-party payers for, these products and treatments. In the United States, The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) establishes coverage and reimbursement policies for healthcare providers treating Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Under current CMS policies, varying reimbursement levels have been established for the Company\u2019s products and treatments. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage policies for Medicare patients may vary by regional Medicare Administrative Contractors. Reimbursement rates for treatments vary based on the geographic price index, the site of service, and other factors. Coverage and reimbursement policies and rates applicable to patients with private insurance are dependent upon individual private payer decisions which may not follow the policies and rates established by CMS. The use of Company products and treatments outside the United States is similarly affected by coverage and reimbursement policies adopted by foreign governments and, to a lesser extent, private insurance carriers. On September 29, 2020, CMS finalized a rule regarding its new RO Model, designed, according to CMS, to improve the quality of care for cancer patients receiving radiotherapy and reduce Medicare expenditures through bundled payments. In the final notice, CMS did not include IORT treatments (including CPT codes 77424, 77425, and 77469) within the new alternative payment model for radiation oncology. As a result, whether or not a particular physician practice or hospital is subject to the new radiation oncology payment model, IORT services covered by Medicare will continue to be subject to the existing payment systems for physician services and hospital outpatient services. On December 10, 2021, the Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequestration Cuts Act delayed the RO Model implementation until no earlier than January 1, 2023. Management cannot provide assurance that government or private third-party payers will continue to reimburse the Company\u2019s products or services, nor can management provide assurance that the payment rates will be adequate. If providers and physicians are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement for the Company\u2019s products or services, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and operations. In addition, in the event that the current methodology for calculating payment for these products or services changes, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and business operations.\nManagement cannot guarantee that providers and physicians will be able to obtain adequate reimbursement for the Company\u2019s products or services.\nThe Company\u2019s business is dependent upon future market growth of full field digital mammography systems, digital computer aided detection products, and tomosynthesis as well as advanced image analysis and workflow solutions for use with MRI and CT and the market growth of electronic brachytherapy. This growth may not occur or may occur too slowly to benefit us.\nThe Company\u2019s future business is substantially dependent on the continued growth in the market for electronic brachytherapy, full field digital mammography systems, digital computer aided detection products and tomosynthesis as well as advanced image analysis and workflow solutions for use with MRI and CT. The market for these products may not continue to develop or may develop at a slower rate than the Company anticipates due to a variety of factors, including, general economic conditions, delays in hospital spending for capital equipment, the significant costs associated with the procurement of full field digital mammography systems and CAD products and MRI and CT systems and the reliance on third party insurance reimbursement. If the market for the products and technologies upon which the Company\u2019s products are dependent does not grow or grows too slowly, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nA limited number of customers account for a significant portion of the Company\u2019s total revenue. The loss of a principal customer could seriously hurt the Company\u2019s business.\nA limited number of major customers have in the past and may continue in the future to account for a significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenue. The Company\u2019s principal\nsales distribution channel for its digital products is through its OEM partners. In 2021, the Company\u2019s OEM partners accounted for 22% of its total revenue, with one major customer, GE Healthcare, accounting for 14% of the Company\u2019s revenue. In addition, in 2021, four customers, consisting of both OEM and direct customers, accounted for 31% of the Company\u2019s total revenue. The loss of the Company\u2019s relationships with principal customers or a decline in sales to principal customers could materially adversely affect its business and operating results.\nIf goodwill and/or other intangible assets that the Company has recorded in connection with its acquisitions become impaired, the Company could have to take significant charges against earnings.\nUnder current accounting, management must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of the Company\u2019s goodwill of $8.4 million at December 31, 2021 and its other intangible assets have been impaired. Any reduction or impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reported results of operations in future periods.\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rate may fluctuate, and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of amounts that have been accrued.\nAs a global company, the Company is subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. In preparing the Company\u2019s financial statements, the Company records the amount of tax payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The Company\u2019s future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than prior years due to numerous factors, including a change in the Company\u2019s geographic earnings mix, changes in the measurement of the Company\u2019s deferred taxes, and recently enacted and future tax law changes in jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The Company is also subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions, and tax authorities may disagree with certain positions the Company has taken and assess additional taxes. Any of these factors could cause the Company to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or the Company\u2019s current expectations, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to use its net operating loss carryovers and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation is generally allowed a deduction for net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) carried over from a prior taxable year. Under that provision, the Company can carryforward its NOLs to offset future taxable income, if any, until such NOLs are fully utilized or expire. The same is true of other unused tax attributes, such as tax credits. Under the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses is limited. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the federal Tax Act.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Code, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percent change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change\nnet operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change\ntax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. The Company may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in the Company\u2019s stock ownership, some of which may be outside of the Company\u2019s control. If an ownership change occurs and the Company\u2019s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes is materially limited, it would harm the Company\u2019s future operating results by effectively increasing the Company\u2019s future tax obligations.\nThe markets for many of the Company\u2019s products are subject to changing technology.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on its ability to adapt to evolving technologies and industry standards and introduce new technology solutions and services accordingly. If the Company cannot adapt to changing technologies, its technology solutions and services may become obsolete, and its business may suffer. Because the healthcare information technology market is constantly evolving, the Company\u2019s existing technology may become obsolete and fail to meet the requirements of current and potential customers. The Company\u2019s success will depend, in part, on its ability to continue to enhance its existing technology solutions and services, develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of its customers, and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost-effective basis. The development of the Company\u2019s proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks. The Company may not be successful in developing, using, marketing, selling, or maintaining new technologies effectively or adapting its proprietary technology to evolving customer requirements or emerging industry standards, and, as a result, the Company\u2019s business and reputation could suffer. The Company may not be able to introduce new technology solutions on schedule, or at all, or such solutions may not achieve market acceptance. Moreover, competitors may develop competitive products that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. The Company\u2019s failure to introduce new products or to introduce these products on schedule could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company depends upon a limited number of suppliers and manufacturers for its products, and certain components in its products may be available from a sole or limited number of suppliers.\nThe Company\u2019s products are generally either manufactured and assembled for it by a sole manufacturer, by a limited number of manufacturers or assembled by the Company from supplies it obtains from a limited number of suppliers. Critical components required to manufacture the Company\u2019s products, whether by outside manufacturers or directly by the Company, may be available from a sole or limited number of component suppliers. The Company generally does not have long-term arrangements with any of its manufacturers or suppliers. The loss of a sole or key manufacturer or supplier could materially impair the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products to its customers in a timely manner and would adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales and operating results. The Company\u2019s business would be harmed if any of its manufacturers or suppliers could not meet its quality and performance specifications and quantity and delivery requirements.\nAdditionally, the Company\u2019s suppliers and manufacturers are, and will continue to be, subject to extensive government regulation in connection with the manufacture of any medical devices. The Company\u2019s suppliers and\nmanufacturers must ensure that they are compliant with applicable quality systems and other regulatory requirements, as mandated by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. If the Company\u2019s materials suppliers or manufacturers face manufacturing or quality control problems this may lead to delays in product production or shipment or the Company\u2019s supplier or manufacturer no longer being able to continue operations. The Company\u2019s business would be harmed if any of its manufacturers or suppliers could not meet its quality and performance specifications and quantity and delivery requirements.\nRevenue from the Company\u2019s new subscription license model may be difficult to predict.\nThe Company is devoting resources to the development of a new software license model to complement its traditional perpetual licensing models. This model allows the Company to license Detection software through subscription licenses that are cancelable at any time. The Company has limited operating history with subscription licensing models and may not be able to accurately predict initial subscription enrollment or future renewal or cancellation rates. Subscription renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including but not limited to customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction with Company products, the price of Company products, the prices of similar competitive products, or customer budget sensitivity. If any of the Company\u2019s assumptions about revenue from the subscription licensing model are incorrect, the Company\u2019s actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, or projected.\nThe Company distributes its products in highly competitive markets and its sales may suffer as a result.\nThe Company operates in highly competitive and rapidly changing markets that contain competitive products available from nationally and internationally recognized companies. Many of these competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than the Company and are well established. In addition, some companies have developed or may develop technologies or products that could compete with the products the Company manufactures and distributes or that would render the Company\u2019s products obsolete or noncompetitive. The Company\u2019s competitors may achieve patent protection, regulatory approval, or product commercialization that would limit the Company\u2019s ability to compete with them. These and other competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect the Company\u2019s business.\nDisruptions in service or damage to the Company\u2019s third-party providers\u2019 data centers could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company relies on third parties who provide access to data centers. The Company\u2019s information technologies and systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from various causes, including (i) acts of God and other natural disasters, war and acts of terrorism and (ii) power losses, computer systems failures, internet and telecommunications or data network failures, operator error, losses of and corruption of data and similar events. The Company conducts business continuity planning and works with its third-party providers to protect against fires, floods, other natural disasters and general business interruptions to mitigate the adverse effects of a disruption, relocation or change in operating environment at the data centers the Company utilizes. In addition, the occurrence of any of these events could result in interruptions, delays or cessations in service to the Company\u2019s customers. Any of these events could impair or prohibit the Company\u2019s ability to provide its services, reduce the attractiveness of its services to current or potential customers and adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, despite the implementation of security measures, the Company\u2019s infrastructure, data centers, or systems that it interfaces with, including the Internet and related systems, may be vulnerable to physical break-ins,\nhackers, improper employee or contractor access, computer viruses, programming errors, denial-of-service\nattacks or other attacks by third-parties seeking to disrupt operations or misappropriate information or similar physical or electronic breaches of security. Any of these can cause system failure, including network, software or hardware failure, which can result in service disruptions. As a result, the Company may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches and hackers or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches.\nInstability in geographies where the Company has operations and personnel or where the Company derives revenue could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, customers, operations and financial results.\nEconomic, civil, military and political uncertainty may arise or increase in regions where the Company operates or derives revenue. Further, countries from which the Company derives revenue may experience military action and/or civil and political unrest. For the fiscal year ended 2021, approximately 8.6% of the Company\u2019s revenue was derived from customers located in Europe, and approximately 39.0% of the Company\u2019s export revenue was derived from customers located in Europe. In late February 2022, Russian military forces launched significant military action against Ukraine. Sustained conflict and disruption in the region is likely. The aggregate impact to Eastern Europe and Europe as a whole, as well as actions taken by other countries, including new and stricter sanctions by the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and other countries and organizations against officials, individuals, regions, and industries in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, and each country\u2019s potential response to such sanctions, tensions and military actions, is not knowable at this time, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its business and operations. Any such material adverse effect from the conflict and enhanced sanctions activity may disrupt the Company\u2019s sales to customers in the region. Prolonged unfavorable economic conditions or uncertainty may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s sales and profitability\nIf the Company\u2019s products fail to perform properly due to errors or similar problems, the Company\u2019s business could suffer.\nDespite testing, complex software may contain defects or errors. Addressing software errors may delay development of the Company\u2019s solutions, and if discovered after deployment, may require the expenditure of substantial time and resources to correct. Errors in the Company\u2019s software could result in:\n\u2022\nharm to the Company\u2019s reputation;\n\u2022\nlost sales;\n\u2022\ndelays in commercial releases;\n\u2022\nproduct liability claims;\n\u2022\ndelays in or loss of market acceptance of the Company\u2019s solutions;\n\u2022\nlicense terminations or renegotiations;\n\u2022\nunexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors; and\n\u2022\nprivacy and security vulnerabilities.\nFurthermore, the Company\u2019s customers might use its software together with products from other companies or those that they have developed internally. As a result, when problems occur, it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem. Even when the Company\u2019s software does not cause these problems, the existence of these errors might cause the Company to incur significant costs, divert the attention of its technical personnel from the Company\u2019s solution development efforts or impact its reputation and cause significant customer relations problems.\nUnfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results\nFrom time to time, the Company is a party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings, claims and government inspections or investigations and other legal matters, both inside and outside the United States, arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise. Legal proceedings are often lengthy, taking place over a period of years with interim motions or judgments subject to multiple levels of review (such as appeals or rehearings) before the outcome is final. Litigation is subject to significant uncertainty and may be expensive, time- consuming, and disruptive to operations. For these and other reasons, the Company may choose to settle legal proceedings and claims, regardless of their actual merit.\nA legal proceeding finally resolved against the Company, could result in significant compensatory damages, and in certain circumstances, punitive or trebled damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief. If the Company\u2019s existing insurance does not cover the amount or types of damages awarded, or if other resolutions or actions taken as a result of the legal proceeding were to restrain the Company\u2019s ability to market one or more of the Company\u2019s material products or services, the Company\u2019s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, legal proceedings, and any adverse resolution thereof, can result in adverse publicity and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business.\nIf the Company is subject to claims that its employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties, the Company could incur substantial expenses.\nThe Company employ individuals who were previously employed at other medical device and technology companies. The Company may be subject to claims that the Company or its employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of employees\u2019 former employers or other third parties. The Company may also be subject to claims that former employers or other parties have an ownership interest in patents or intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. The Company may not be successful in defending these claims, and if the Company is successful, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to its management and other employees.\nHealthcare industry consolidation could impose pressure on the Company\u2019s prices, reduce potential customer base and reduce demands for the Company\u2019s systems.\nMany hospitals and imaging centers have consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market and purchasing power. When hospitals and imaging centers combine, they often consolidate infrastructure, and consolidation of the Company\u2019s customers could result in fewer overall customers. If this consolidation trend continues, it could reduce the size of the Company\u2019s potential customer base, reduce demand for the Company\u2019s systems, give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining or purchasing power, and may lead to erosion of the prices for the Company\u2019s systems or decreased margins for its systems, all of which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to generate revenue.\nClinical trials are very expensive, lengthy, and difficult to design and implement and have uncertain outcomes, and, as a result, the Company may suffer delays or suspensions in current or future trials which would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to obtain regulatory approvals timely or at all, and if the Company fails to receive such approvals, on its ability to generate revenues.\nClinical trials involve a time-consuming and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and the results of earlier trials are not necessarily predictive of future results. Human clinical trials are difficult to design and implement and very expensive, due in part to being subject to rigorous regulatory requirements.\nAdditionally, the Company may encounter problems at any stage of the trials that cause it to abandon or repeat clinical trials. The commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by several factors, including:\n\u2022\nnon-approval\nof an investigational device exemption (IDE), which is required by the FDA for the study in humans of a significant risk device that is not approved for the indication being studied;\n\u2022\nfailure to reach an agreement with contract research organizations or clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nfailure of third-party contract research organizations to properly implement or monitor the clinical trial protocols;\n\u2022\nfailure of IRBs to approve the Company\u2019s clinical trial protocols or suspension or termination of the Company\u2019s clinical trial by the IRB, DSMB, or the FDA;\n\u2022\nslower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment, which may be further negatively impacted by the COVID-19\nglobal pandemic;\n\u2022\ninability to retain patients in clinical trials, which may be further negatively impacted by the COVID-19\nglobal pandemic;\n\u2022\nlack of effectiveness during clinical trials;\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety issues;\n\u2022\ninability or unwillingness of medical clinical investigators and institutional review boards to follow the Company\u2019s clinical trial protocols;\n\u2022\nfailure of clinical investigators or sites to maintain necessary licenses or permits or comply with good clinical practices, or GCP, or other regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\nlack of sufficient funding to finance the clinical trials.\nIn addition, the Company or regulatory authorities may suspend the Company\u2019s clinical trials at any time if it appears that the Company is exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if the regulatory authorities find deficiencies in the Company\u2019s regulatory submissions or the conduct of these trials. Any suspension of clinical trials will delay possible regulatory approval, increase costs, and adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to develop products and generate revenue.\nThe Company\u2019s future prospects depend on its ability to retain current key employees and attract additional qualified personnel.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends in large part on the continued service of its executive officers and other key employees. The Company may not be able to retain the services of its executive officers and other key employees. The loss of executive officers or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nIn addition, in order to support its continued growth, the Company will be required to effectively recruit, develop and retain additional qualified personnel. If the Company is unable to attract and retain additional necessary personnel, it could delay or hinder its plans for growth. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully attract, assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. The failure to retain and attract necessary personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s international operations expose it to various risks, any number of which could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s revenue from sales outside of the United States represented approximately 22% of the Company\u2019s revenue for 2021. The Company is subject to the risks inherent in conducting business across national boundaries, any one of which could adversely impact its business. In addition to currency fluctuations, these risks include, among other things: economic downturns; changes in or interpretations of local law, governmental policy or regulation; changes in healthcare practice patterns; restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of the country; varying tax systems; and government protectionism. One or more of the foregoing factors could impair the Company\u2019s current or future operations and, as a result, harm the Company\u2019s overall business.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nThe Company relies on intellectual property and proprietary rights to maintain its competitive position and may not be able to protect these rights.\nThe Company relies heavily on proprietary technology that it protects primarily through licensing arrangements, patents, trade secrets, proprietary know-how\nand non-disclosure\nagreements. There can be no assurance that any\npending or future patent applications will be granted or that any current or future patents, regardless of whether the Company is an owner or a licensee of the patent, will not be challenged, rendered unenforceable, invalidated, or circumvented or that the rights will provide a competitive advantage to the Company. There can also be no assurance that the Company\u2019s trade secrets or non-disclosure\nagreements will provide meaningful protection of Company proprietary information. Further, the Company cannot assure that others will not independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by the Company or that its technology will not infringe upon patents or other rights owned by others. Unauthorized third parties may infringe the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights or copy or reverse engineer portions of the Company\u2019s technology. In addition, because patent applications in the United States are not generally publicly disclosed until eighteen months after the application is filed, applications may have been filed by third parties that relate to the Company\u2019s technology. Moreover, there is a risk that foreign intellectual property laws will not protect the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights to the same extent as intellectual property laws in the United States. The rights provided by a patent are finite in time. The Company has certain patents that expire between 2022 and 2029. In the absence of significant patent protection, the Company may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy the Company\u2019s products, processes or technology.\nIn addition, in the future, the Company may be required to assert infringement claims against third parties, and there can be no assurance that one or more parties will not assert infringement claims against the Company. Any resulting litigation or proceeding could result in significant expense to the Company and divert the efforts of its management personnel, whether or not such litigation or proceeding is determined in the Company\u2019s favor. In addition, if any of the Company\u2019s intellectual property and proprietary rights are deemed to violate the proprietary rights of others, the Company may be prevented from using those intellectual property or proprietary rights, which could prevent it from being able to sell its products. Litigation could also result in a judgment or monetary damages being levied against the Company.\nIf the Company fails to obtain licenses to necessary intellectual property or does not comply with its obligations in license agreements, the Company could lose important rights.\nThe Company may need to obtain licenses from owners of intellectual property to advance its research and products or allow commercialization of its product, and the Company has done so from time to time. If the Company does not obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost and on reasonable terms, the Company would be unable to further develop and commercialize one or more of its product, which could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nRisks Related to Regulation of the Company\u2019s Industry\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated, and government authorities may determine that the Company has failed to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations. Additionally, the Company may incur substantial costs defending its interpretations of U.S. federal and state government regulations, and if the Company loses, the government could force the Company to restructure its operations and subject it to fines, monetary penalties and possibly exclude the Company from participation in U.S. government-sponsored health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nBoth in the United States and in other jurisdictions, the healthcare industry is subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, compliance with which imposes substantial costs on the Company. Such laws and regulations include those that are directed at payment for services and the conduct of operations, preventing fraud and abuse, and prohibiting general business corporations, such as the Company\u2019s, from engaging in practices that may influence professional decision-making, such as splitting fees with physicians. In addition, the Company believes that its business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as legislatures and governmental agencies periodically consider proposals to revise or create new requirements, particularly in response to and following the COVID-19\npandemic, the scope and effect of which the Company cannot predict. Such proposals, if implemented, could impact the Company\u2019s operations, the use of its services, and its ability to market new services, and could create unexpected liabilities for the Company.\nMany healthcare laws are complex, and their application to specific services and relationships may not be clear. The laws often have related rules and regulations that are subject to interpretation and may not provide definitive guidance as to their application to the Company\u2019s operations, including its arrangements with physicians and professional corporations. Further, healthcare laws differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and it is difficult to ensure the Company\u2019s business complies with evolving laws in all jurisdictions.\nConsequently, the Company\u2019s operations, including its arrangements with healthcare providers, are subject to audits, inquiries and investigations from government agencies from time to time. The Company believes it is in substantial compliance with these laws, rules and regulations based upon what the Company believes are reasonable and defensible interpretations of these laws, rules and regulations. However, U.S. federal and state laws are broadly worded and may be interpreted or applied by prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authorities in ways that the Company cannot predict. Accordingly, the Company may in the future become the subject of regulatory or other investigations or proceedings, and its interpretations of applicable laws, rules and regulations may be challenged. Any challenge to the Company\u2019s operations or arrangements with third parties that the Company has structured based upon its interpretation of these laws, rules and regulations could potentially disrupt business operations and lead to substantial defense costs and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, even if the Company successfully defends its interpretation. In addition, if the government successfully challenges the Company\u2019s interpretation of the applicability of these laws, rules and regulations as they relate to its operations and arrangements, such successful challenge may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nIn the event regulatory action were to limit or prohibit the Company from carrying on its business as it presently conducts it or from expanding its operations into certain jurisdictions, the Company may need to make structural, operational and organizational modifications to the Company or to its contractual arrangements with physicians and professional corporations. The Company\u2019s operating costs could increase significantly as a result. The Company could also lose contracts, or its revenues could decrease under existing contracts. Any restructuring would also negatively impact the Company\u2019s operations because its management\u2019s time and attention would be diverted from running its business in the ordinary course.\nCompliance with the many laws and regulations governing the healthcare industry could restrict the Company\u2019s sales and marketing practices, and other relationships with healthcare professionals.\nOnce the Company\u2019s products are sold, the Company must comply with various U.S. federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, rules and regulations pertaining false claims, kickbacks and physician self-referral. Violations of the fraud and abuse laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration health programs, workers\u2019 compensation programs and TRICARE. Compliance with these laws could restrict the Company\u2019s sales and marketing practices, and any challenge to the Company\u2019s practices could disrupt its operations and lead to substantial defense costs and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, even if the Company successfully defends its practices. If the Company is unable to successfully defend its practices, in addition to incurring significant expense in defending itself, the Company could be subject to a significant settlement, monetary penalties, and costs related to implementation of changes to its practices, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nHealthcare reform legislation in the United States may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and/or results of operations.\nThe Company is unable to predict what legislation or regulation relating to the health care industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on the Company\u2019s business. Any cost containment measures or other health care system reforms that are adopted could have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to commercialize its existing and\nfuture products successfully. The Company cannot predict whether any existing or enacted legislation will be repealed, replaced, or modified or how such repeal, replacement or modification may be timed or structured.\nAs a result, the Company cannot quantify or predict the effect of such repeal, replacement, or modification might have on its business and results of operations. However, any changes that lower reimbursement for the Company\u2019s products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect its business and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s products and manufacturing facilities are subject to extensive regulation with potentially significant costs for compliance.\nIn the United States, the Company\u2019s CAD systems and Xoft Systems are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the FDCA. The FDA\u2019s regulation of the Company\u2019s products includes its manufacturing operations, product labeling, adverse event reporting, and the FDA\u2019s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d\nuses.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to fully comply with applicable regulations could result in the issuance of warning letters, non-approvals,\nsuspensions of existing approvals, civil penalties and criminal fines, product seizures and recalls, operating restrictions, injunctions, and criminal prosecution. Moreover, unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new requirements could increase the Company\u2019s operating and compliance burdens and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSales of the Company\u2019s products in certain countries outside of the United States are also subject to extensive regulatory approvals. Obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals is an expensive and time-consuming process. The Company cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals timely or at all in any foreign country in which the Company plans to market its CAD products and Xoft Systems, and if the Company fails to receive such approvals, its ability to generate revenue may be significantly diminished.\nThe Company may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for any of the other products that we may consider developing.\nThe Company has received the required premarket approvals from FDA or the equivalent foreign authority in the relevant jurisdictions in which its currently offers its products. Before the Company is able to commercialize any new product or promote a new indicated use of an existing product, it must obtain the required regulatory approvals. The process for satisfying these regulatory requirements is lengthy and costly and will require the Company to comply with complex standards for research and development, clinical trials, testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling, and promotion of products. Additionally, even if the Company receives regulatory approval for a new product or indicated use in one jurisdiction, its products may be subject to separate regulatory approval in each country or jurisdiction in which the Company plans to market its products. The Company cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals timely or at all in any country or jurisdiction. Successfully obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction does not guarantee approval in another; however, a delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may negatively affect the regulatory process in another. If the Company is unable to obtain regulatory approval for other products or indicated uses, its ability to generate sufficient revenue to continue its business may be significantly impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s products may be recalled even after it has received FDA or other governmental approval or clearance.\nIf the safety or efficacy of any of the Company\u2019s products is called into question, the Company may initiate or the FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries may press the Company to implement or even require a product recall, even if the Company\u2019s product received approval or clearance by the FDA or a similar\ngovernmental body. Such a recall would divert the focus of the Company\u2019s management and its financial resources and could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation with customers and its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and other matters. The Company may be subject to criminal or civil sanctions if it fails to comply with privacy and security regulations regarding the use and disclosure of sensitive personally identifiable information.\nNumerous state and federal laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability and integrity of personally identifiable information, including HIPAA. In the provision of services to the Company\u2019s customers, the Company and its third-party vendors may collect, use, maintain and transmit patient health information in ways that are subject to many of these laws and regulations. The Company is also subject to laws and regulations in foreign countries covering data privacy and other protection of health and employee information that may be more onerous than corresponding U.S. laws, including in particular the laws of Europe.\nThe Company\u2019s customers are covered entities, and the Company is a business associate of its customers under HIPAA as a result of the Company\u2019s contractual obligations to perform certain functions on behalf of and provide certain services to those customers. In the ordinary course of business, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including personally identifiable information received from its customers. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to the Company\u2019s operations. Despite its security measures and business controls, the Company\u2019s information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions or subject to the inadvertent or intentional unauthorized release of information. Any such occurrence could compromise the Company\u2019s networks and the information stored thereon could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information by the Company or its subcontractors could (i) result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and regulatory penalties, (ii) disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and the services it provides to its customers and (iii) damage the Company\u2019s reputation, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability, revenue and competitive position.\nFederal and state consumer laws are being applied increasingly by the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general to regulate the collection, use and disclosure of personal or patient health information, through web sites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of web site content. Numerous other federal and state laws protect the confidentiality, privacy, availability, integrity and security of personally identifiable information. These laws in many cases are more restrictive than, and not preempted by, HIPAA and may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for the Company and its customers and potentially exposing the Company to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability. The Company may not remain in compliance with the diverse privacy requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which it does business.\nHIPAA and federal and state laws and regulations may require users of personally identifiable information to implement specified security measures. Evolving laws and regulations in this area could require the Company to incur significant additional costs to re-design\nits products in a timely manner to reflect these legal requirements, which could have an adverse impact on its results of operations.\nNew personally identifiable information standards, whether implemented pursuant to HIPAA, congressional action or otherwise, could have a significant effect on the manner in which the Company must handle healthcare related data, and the cost of complying with standards could be significant. If the Company does not properly comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to patient health information, it could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions.\nData protection laws in the United States, Europe and around the world may restrict the Company\u2019s activities and increase the Company\u2019s costs.\nVarious statutes and rules in the United States, Europe and around the world regulate privacy and data protection which may affect the Company\u2019s collection, use, storage, and transfer of information both abroad and in the United States. New laws and regulations are being enacted, so that this area remains in a state of flux. Monitoring and complying with these laws requires substantial financial resources. Failure to comply with these laws may result in, among other things, civil and criminal liability, negative publicity, restrictions on further use of data, and/or liability under contractual warranties. In addition, changes in these laws (including newly released interpretations of these laws by courts and regulatory bodies) may limit the Company\u2019s data access, use and disclosure, and may require increased expenditures by us.\nThe European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) requires the Company to meet new and more stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data about EU residents. Failure to meet the GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue.\nRisk Related to the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nA substantial number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock are eligible for future sale, and the sale of shares of common stock into the market, or the perception that such sales may occur, may depress the Company\u2019s stock price.\nSales of substantial additional shares of the Company\u2019s common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, may significantly lower the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Company is unable to estimate the amount, timing or nature of future sales of shares of its common stock. The Company has previously issued a substantial number of shares of common stock, which are eligible for resale under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), and may become freely tradable. The Company has also registered shares that are issuable upon the exercise of options and warrants. If holders of options, or warrants choose to exercise or convert their securities and sell shares of common stock issued upon the such exercise or conversion in the public market or if holders of currently restricted common stock choose to sell such shares of common stock in the public market under Rule 144 or otherwise, or attempt to publicly sell such shares all at once or in a short time period, the prevailing market price for the Company\u2019s common stock may decline.\nThe Company has a limited number of shares of common stock available for future issuance which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to raise capital or consummate acquisitions.\nThe Company is currently authorized to issue 60,000,000 shares of common stock under its amended Certificate of Incorporation (\u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d). As of December 31, 2021, the Company had issued 25,326,086 shares\nof common stock and had 2,486,511 shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of options granted, 875 shares of common stock reserved for vesting of restricted stock and 882,608 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nOn March 5, 2021, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of 1,393,738 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $18.00 per share.\nThe Company\u2019s stockholders approved a proposal to amend the Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201cAmendment to the Certificate of Incorporation\u201d) to increase the Company\u2019s authorized shares of common stock from 30,000,000 shares to 60,000,000 shares, and a proposal to approve an amendment to the Company\u2019s 2016 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, to increase the number of shares of common stock available thereunder from 2,600,000 shares to 4,700,000 shares and to increase the aggregate number of incentive stock options available thereunder from 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 (the \u201cPlan Amendment\u201d). Following stockholder approval of\nall Proposals at the Meeting, the Company filed the Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on July 21, 2021, and the Plan Amendment was made effective as of July 15, 2021.\nDue to the limited number of authorized shares of common stock available for issuance, the Company may not be able to raise additional equity capital or complete a merger, other business combination or partnership unless the Company increases the number of shares it is authorized to issue.\nIf the Company does not receive the requisite stockholder approval, its operations could be materially adversely impacted. In addition, an increase in the authorized number of shares of common stock and the subsequent issuance of such shares could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company without further action by the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nProvisions in the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation and in Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Company, discourage a takeover and adversely affect existing stockholders.\nThe Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, without further action by stockholders, and may include, among other things, voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, and sinking fund provisions. Although there are currently no shares of preferred stock outstanding, future holders of preferred stock may have rights superior to the Company\u2019s common stock and such rights could also be used to restrict the Company\u2019s ability to merge with or sell its assets to a third party.\nThe Company is also subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could prevent the Company from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with a 15% or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date such person acquired that status unless appropriate board or stockholder approvals are obtained.\nThese provisions could deter unsolicited takeovers or delay or prevent changes in the Company\u2019s control or management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price. These provisions may also limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock has been, and may continue to be volatile, which could reduce the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe publicly traded shares of the Company\u2019s common stock have experienced, and may experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility could reduce the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock without regard to its operating performance. In addition, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock could change significantly in response to actual or anticipated variations in its quarterly operating results, announcements by the Company or its competitors, factors affecting the medical imaging industry generally, changes in national or regional economic conditions, changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates for the Company or its competitors\u2019 or industry\u2019s future performance or general market conditions, making it more difficult for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock to be sold at a favorable price or at all. The market price of the Company\u2019s common stock could also be reduced by general market price declines or market volatility in the future or future declines or volatility in the prices of stocks for companies in the Company\u2019s industry.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise the Company\u2019s information and expose the Company to liability, which would cause its business and reputation to suffer and could subject it to substantial liabilities.\nIf the Company\u2019s security measures are breached or fail and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer\u2019s data, the Company\u2019s service may be perceived as insecure, the attractiveness of its services to current or potential customers may be reduced, and the Company may incur significant liabilities.\nThe Company\u2019s services involve the storage and transmission of customers\u2019 proprietary information and patient information, including health, financial, payment and other personal or confidential information. The Company relies on proprietary and commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring, as well as other processes, to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of such information. Because of the sensitivity of this information and due to requirements under applicable laws and regulations, the effectiveness of such security efforts is very important. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be subject to cybersecurity incidents that bypass its security measures, impact the integrity, availability or privacy of personally identifiable information or other data subject to privacy laws or disrupt the Company\u2019s information systems, devices or business, including its ability to deliver services to its customers. As a result, cybersecurity, physical security and the continued development and enhancement of the Company\u2019s controls, processes and practices designed to protect its enterprise, information systems and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority. As cyber threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The occurrence of any of these events could result in (i) harm to customers; (ii) business interruptions and delays; (iii) the loss, misappropriation, corruption or unauthorized access of data; (iv) litigation, including potential class action litigation, and potential liability under privacy, security and consumer protection laws or other applicable laws; (v) reputational damage; and (vi) federal and state governmental inquiries, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations and harm its business reputation.\nChanges in interpretation or application of Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nManagement prepares the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements to conform to GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various other regulatory or accounting bodies. A change in interpretations of, or management\u2019s application of, these principles can have a significant effect on the Company\u2019s reported results and may even affect the Company\u2019s reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced. In addition, when the Company is required to adopt new accounting standards, the Company\u2019s methods of accounting for certain items may change, which could cause the Company\u2019s results of operations to fluctuate from period to period and make it more difficult to compare the Company\u2019s financial results to prior periods.\nAs the Company\u2019s operations evolve over time, the Company may introduce new products or new technologies that require it to apply different accounting principles, including ones regarding revenue recognition, than the Company has applied in past periods. The application of different types of accounting principles and related potential changes may make it more difficult to compare the Company\u2019s financial results from quarter to quarter, and the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock could suffer or become more volatile as a result.\nThe Company cannot be certain of the future effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting or the impact of the same on its operations or the market price for the Company\u2019s common stock.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSection 404\u201d), the Company is required to include in its Annual Report on Form 10-K\nits assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal controls over\nfinancial reporting. The Company has dedicated a significant amount of time and resources to ensure compliance with this legislation for the year ended December 31, 2021 and will continue to do so for future fiscal periods. Although the Company believes that it currently has adequate internal control procedures in place, it cannot be certain that its internal controls over financial reporting will continue to be effective. If the Company cannot adequately maintain the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting, it might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. Any such action could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results and the market price of its common stock.\nChanges in credit markets or to the Company\u2019s credit rating could impact its ability to obtain financing for business operations or result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense.\nThe Company\u2019s credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency\u2019s opinion of its financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet its debt obligations at the time such opinion is issued. The Company utilizes the short- and long-term debt markets to obtain capital from time to time. Adverse changes in the Company\u2019s credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market.
