{"cik": "1568319", "company": "Voltari Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following risk factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See \"Special Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" appearing at the beginning of this report. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that are currently deemed immaterial may also adversely affect our business operations. If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected. We undertake no obligations to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nThe market price of our common stock is highly volatile and may not relate to our operating performance, financial results or prospects. In addition, features of our Series J preferred stock may make it difficult for holders of our common stock to realize value on their investment.\nThe market price for our common stock is highly volatile. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2017, the closing sales price of our common stock, which is quoted on the OTCQB marketplace under the symbol \u201cVLTC\u201d fluctuated from a low of $0.37 per share to a high of $3.39 per share. As of March 12, 2018, the closing sales price of our common stock was $1.24 per share.\nBroad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance, financial results or prospects. The stock market in general has in the past and may in the future experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to individual companies\u2019 operating performance. The price of our common stock could fluctuate widely based on a variety of additional factors, including actual or anticipated changes in our financial condition and operating results; media speculation regarding the intentions of our controlling stockholder; announcements by us of capital commitments or significant changes in our business strategy; transactions in our securities by us or our security holders, including acquisitions or dispositions by our controlling stockholder, directors or officers; and other factors affecting us and our industry, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations.\nThe current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices or intrinsic value, and we may not be able to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock. Investors in our securities may experience a decrease, which could be substantial, in the value of their securities, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance, financial results or prospects. Investors in our securities could lose part or all of their investment.\nOther factors may adversely affect the market price, and intrinsic value, of our common stock, including features of our Series J preferred stock. Our common stock is ranked junior to our Series J preferred stock with respect to cash dividends and amounts payable in the event of our dissolution, liquidation or winding up. This means that, unless full cumulative dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding Series J preferred stock for all accrued dividends, no cash dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock. As of December 31, 2017, holders of our Series J preferred stock were owed $28.0 million in dividends. Also, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common stock until we have paid to our Series J preferred stockholders the liquidation preference relating to such preferred stock, including in each case any accrued and unpaid dividends. As of December 31, 2017, the total liquidation preference on the outstanding shares of our Series J preferred stock, including accrued and unpaid dividends as of such date, was $57.2 million. In the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, our asset value would inure to the benefit of holders of our Series J preferred stock, up to the value of the Series J preferred stock liquidation preference plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, before holders of our common stock would realize any return from our asset value.\nThe value of our common stock may also be adversely affected if, and to the extent that, our Series J preferred stock becomes redeemable. The holders of our Series J preferred stock may require us to redeem their shares of Series J preferred stock at a redemption price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference per share in effect at such time plus accrued and unpaid dividends through the next dividend payment date after the redemption date, in connection with a redemption event. A redemption event occurs if (i) we undergo a change in control, which includes a person becoming a beneficial owner of securities representing at least 50% of the voting power of our company, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and certain business combinations and mergers which cause a change in 20% or more of the voting power of our company, or (ii) we experience an ownership change (within the meaning of Section 382 (\u201cSection 382\u201d)of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201dCode\u201d)), which results in a substantial limitation on our ability to use our net operating losses and related tax benefits. The Company believes that, if a redemption event were to occur, limited, if any, funds would be available for such redemption under the terms of the Series J preferred stock and applicable Delaware law. As a result, in the event that a redemption event were to occur, the Company currently expects that it would be precluded, under the terms of the Series J preferred stock and applicable Delaware law, from making any material redemptions.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our Series J preferred stock had an aggregate redemption value of approximately $57.2 million, including paid in-kind dividends of $26.2 million and accrued dividends of $1.8 million. Dividends declared or accrued on the Series J preferred stock reduce the amount of net earnings, if any, that may be available to common stockholders.\nIn addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is currently limited by the terms of our Series J preferred stock and may be further restricted by the terms of any future debt or preferred securities. Accordingly, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in our common stock may be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit. The market price for our common stock may never exceed, and may fall below, the price that you paid for such common stock.\nWe are implementing a transformation plan, which may not be successful.\nWe have been implementing a transformation plan pursuant to which, among other things, we have exited our mobile marketing and advertising business and have entered into the business of acquiring, leasing and financing commercial real properties. In connection with this transformation plan, on September 17, 2015 we acquired our first commercial real property, located in Long Branch, New Jersey and on May 18, 2016 we acquired our second commercial property, located in Flanders, New York. We have entered into an agreement to acquire a third commercial property though we can make no assurances that the closing conditions will be satisfied or that the purchase will be consummated in a timely manner, if at all. Our ability to generate revenues and become profitable will be dependent in large part on our ability to acquire, lease and finance additional commercial real properties. There can be no assurance that we will be able to do so or that we will ever achieve profitability.\nOur failure to successfully execute our transformation plan would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity. While we believe our transition costs are generally completed, we could still incur unanticipated costs or become subject to liabilities in connection with our exit from the mobile marketing and advertising business and our entry into the business of acquiring, leasing and financing commercial real properties. For example, we may incur unanticipated costs and/or become subject to litigation from customers, vendors or other third parties in connection with our exit from the mobile marketing and advertising business, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nWe have limited operating experience in the commercial real estate business, which makes it difficult to predict the long-term success of our new business model. In addition, because of our new business plan, our historical performance is not a meaningful indicator of future results.\nWe have a history of net operating losses and may continue to suffer losses in the future.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, we had net losses of approximately $7.0 million, $195.4 million, $34.2 million, $10.3 million, $29.3 million, $6.6 million, $3.1 million and $1.9 million respectively. If we cannot become profitable, our financial condition will deteriorate further, and we may be unable to achieve our business objectives.\nOur common stock is traded on the OTCQB Market, which could have material adverse consequences for us and our investors.\nSince the opening of business on December 23, 2016, our common stock has been quoted on the OTCQB marketplace under the symbol \u201cVLTC.\u201d Stocks traded on the OTCQB marketplace generally have a more limited trading volume and exhibit a wider spread between the bid/ask quotations than stock traded on national exchanges. Many institutional investors have investment policies which prohibit them from trading in stocks on the OTCQB marketplace. The OTCQB marketplace affords our stockholders fewer corporate governance protections than if we were listed on a national exchange, such as requirements concerning the independence of our board of directors. As a result of our delisting from trading on The NASDAQ Stock Market, and the subsequent quotation of our common stock on the OTCQB marketplace, we and our investors could face adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf\nlimited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf\nreduced liquidity for our securities;\n\u25cf\nincreased volatility in the market price and trading volume for our securities;\n\u25cf\na determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which would require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity for our securities;\n\u25cf\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u25cf\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nWe have limited experience acquiring commercial real properties.\nOur experience in acquiring, leasing and financing commercial real properties is limited. As a result, we may encounter unforeseen difficulties in our efforts to identify essential assets, assess the risk levels associated with such assets, negotiate favorable terms with property owners, negotiate favorable terms with lessees, and comply with applicable laws and regulations.\nIf we are unable to correctly predict rental rates, cancellation rates, demand, consolidation trends and growth trends, a material adverse impact on our results of operations could result. If we are unable to effectively expand, our growth rate may be adversely impacted.\nWe intend to pursue acquisitions of additional properties and may be unsuccessful in this pursuit, and any acquisitions that we do consummate may fail to meet our expectations.\nWe intend to pursue acquisitions of additional properties to grow our business in connection with our transformation plan. Further, in order to continue to grow our real estate portfolio in a manner designed to, over time, help us generate profits, we may pursue higher valued properties than the properties we currently own. While we anticipate that acquisitions of any such higher valued properties would likely generate relatively higher rental income, such acquisitions would likely also involve higher acquisition costs and may involve higher costs of maintenance. There can be no assurance that we will invest in any such higher valued properties on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nAccordingly, from time to time, we may engage in discussions that may result in one or more transactions. Although there is uncertainty that any of these discussions will result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transaction, we may devote a significant amount of management and other resources to such a transaction, which could negatively impact our operations. We may incur significant costs in connection with seeking acquisitions regardless of whether any transaction is completed.\nAs of the date of this report, we have completed two real estate acquisitions in connection with the execution of our transformation plan. On January 19, 2018, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Voltari Holding, entered into the McClatchy Purchase Agreement. The closing of such purchase is subject to customary conditions precedent, including a due diligence period. The Company makes no assurances that the conditions will be satisfied or that the purchase will be consummated in a timely manner, if at all. Until and unless we acquire additional properties, the rental payments by our existing lessees will represent the sole source of our revenues. The termination of any of our leases or our failure to maintain them on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe real estate industry is highly competitive, and we will face competition from many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities, including individuals, corporations, REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, and other investors, some of whom are significantly larger and have greater resources and lower costs of capital. This competition will make it more challenging to identify and successfully capitalize on acquisition opportunities that meet our investment objectives. If we cannot identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of properties at favorable prices or if we are unable to finance acquisition opportunities on commercially favorable terms, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nInvestments in, and acquisitions of, properties we might seek to acquire entail risks associated with real estate investments generally, including, but not limited to, the following risks and as noted elsewhere in this report:\n\u25cf\nwe may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition;\n\u25cf\neven if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price;\n\u25cf\neven if we enter into agreements for the acquisition of properties, these agreements are subject to customary conditions to closing, including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction;\n\u25cf\nwe may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, including ones that we are subsequently unable to complete;\n\u25cf\nwe may acquire properties that are not initially accretive to our results upon acquisition, and we may not successfully lease those properties to meet our expectations;\n\u25cf\nwe may be unable to finance the acquisition on favorable terms in the time period we desire, or at all; even if we are able to finance the acquisition, our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments;\n\u25cf\nwe may spend more than budgeted to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties;\n\u25cf\nwe may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations;\n\u25cf\nmarket conditions may result in higher than expected vacancy rates and lower than expected rental rates; and\n\u25cf\nwe may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities.\nIn the event that we consummate an acquisition in the future, there is no assurance that we would fully realize the potential benefits of such a transaction. Further, acquisitions of properties we might seek to acquire entail risks associated with real estate investments generally, including that the investment's performance will fail to meet expectations. To the extent we acquire higher valued properties as discussed above, these and other real estate-related risks may be exacerbated by the increased costs and obligations associated with any such higher valued properties.\nOur ongoing leadership transition could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nOur ongoing leadership transition could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results or financial condition. On May 11, 2015, Richard Sadowsky resigned from his position as our acting Chief Executive Officer and from all other positions he held, effective immediately. In addition, effective May 11, 2015, Aaron Epstein was appointed as our President. John Breeman, in addition to his role as our Chief Financial Officer, served as our acting principal executive officer and principal financial officer. During 2016, both John Breeman and Aaron Epstein departed from the Company. On September 24, 2015, each of Messrs. Andrew Roberto, James Nelson and Hunter Gary notified us of his resignation from our Board and each committee of the Board on which he served, effective September 25, 2015. On September 24, 2015, Peter Shea was appointed to the Board, effective September 25, 2015. Mr. Shea was also appointed to serve as Chairperson of the Board, Chairperson of the Compensation and Governance and Nominating Committees and as a member of our Audit Committee. On September 28, 2015, the Board appointed Kenneth Goldmann as Chief Administrative and Accounting Officer of the Company, effective as of October 5, 2015. On April 30, 2016, the Board appointed Andreea Paraschivoiu as the Chief Financial Officer of the Company. On November 14, 2016, Ms. Paraschivoiu resigned from her position as our Chief Financial Officer. On April 21, 2017, Sachin Latawa was appointed to the Board. On May 10, 2017, the Board appointed Peter Kaouris as Chief Accounting Officer and Kenneth Goldmann as Chief Financial Officer of the Company. On August 8, 2017, the Board changed Mr. Kenneth Goldmann's title to Principal Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Kaouris also currently serves as our Principal Financial Officer.\nThe uncertainty inherent in our ongoing leadership transition can be difficult to manage, may cause concerns from third parties with whom we do business, and may increase the likelihood of turnover of other key officers and employees. In addition, our current management team lacks significant experience in the commercial real estate business, and we may need to hire personnel with relevant experience to help us execute our transformation plan. We cannot assure that we will be able to do so, and our failure to do so could materially harm our results of operations.\nWe will be dependent on our tenants to make payments to us under our leases, and an event that materially and adversely affects our tenants\u2019 business, financial position or results of operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations.\nPursuant to our transformation plan, to the extent we generate revenues, we will generate substantially all of our revenues from payments made by our tenants. Additionally, to the extent we are able to enter into triple net leases, we will depend on our tenants to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities, and maintenance and repair expenses related to the applicable property, subject to limited carveouts, and to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with its business. There can be no assurance that our tenants will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to satisfy their payment obligations under the applicable leases. The failure of a tenant to satisfy its other obligations under the lease, such as the payment of insurance, taxes and utilities, could materially and adversely affect the condition of our properties. For these reasons, if a tenant were to experience a material and adverse effect on its business, financial position or results of operations, our business, financial position or results of operations could also be materially and adversely affected.\nDue to our dependence on rental payments from our tenants as our primary source of revenues, we may be limited in our ability to enforce our rights under, or to terminate, the applicable leases. Failure by a tenant to comply with the terms of a lease could require us to find another lessee for the property. There is no assurance that we would be able to lease a property to another lessee on substantially equivalent or better terms, or at all, successfully reposition the property for other uses or sell the property on terms that are favorable to us.\nThe historical information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may not be a reliable indicator of future results.\nOur historical financial data included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may not reflect what our business, financial position or results of operations will be in the future, even after taking into account that our historical mobile marketing and advertising business is reported herein as discontinued operations. The historical financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not necessarily indicative of how we will conduct our business as we continue our efforts to implement our transformation plan. Significant changes have and will continue to occur in our cost structure, financing and business operations as a result of our transformation plan.\nOur operating results may be affected by economic and regulatory changes that have an adverse impact on the commercial real estate market in general, and we can provide no assurance that we will be profitable or that we will realize growth in the value of our commercial real estate properties.\nOur operating results are subject to risks generally incident to the ownership of real estate, including:\n\u25cf\nchanges in general economic or local conditions;\n\u25cf\nchanges in supply of or demand for competing properties in an area;\n\u25cf\nchanges in interest rates and availability of permanent mortgage funds that may render the sale of a property difficult or unattractive;\n\u25cf\nchanges in tax, real estate, environmental and zoning laws; and\n\u25cf\nperiods of high interest rates and tight money supply.\nThese and other risks may prevent us from realizing growth or maintaining the value of our real estate properties or from becoming profitable.\nOur operations may face adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies or insolvencies.\nThe bankruptcy or insolvency of any of our tenants may adversely affect the income produced by our properties. If a tenant defaults, we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord. If a tenant files for bankruptcy, we cannot evict the tenant solely because of such bankruptcy. A court, however, may authorize a tenant to reject or terminate its lease with us. We may also incur additional vacancy and other re-tenanting expense.\nMr. Carl C. Icahn indirectly owns a majority of our common stock and Series J preferred stock, our certificate of incorporation waives the corporate opportunity doctrine as it relates to funds affiliated with him and he may have interests that diverge from those of other stockholders, and one of his affiliates is our principal lender.\nFollowing the completion, and as a result of, our rights offering on March 30, 2015, entities affiliated with Mr. Carl C. Icahn, our largest stockholder, became the beneficial owner of, and had voting control over, approximately 52.3% of our common stock. This amount increased to 52.7% following the forfeiture by our Board on August 20, 2015 of 73,525 shares of restricted common stock, in the aggregate. Entities affiliated with Mr. Carl C. Icahn also previously owned warrants to purchase an additional 9.7% of our common stock. On October 11, 2017, warrants to purchase 1,014,958 shares of our common stock, including the warrants beneficially owned by Mr. Icahn, expired without being exercised. Further, Mr. Icahn beneficially owns 98.0% of our Series J preferred stock, which has limited voting rights. Mr. Carl C. Icahn is able to control and exert substantial influence over us, including the election of our directors and controlling most matters requiring board or stockholder approval, including business strategies, mergers, business combinations, acquisitions or dispositions of significant assets, issuances of common stock, incurrence of debt or other financing and the payment of dividends. The existence of a controlling stockholder may have the effect of making it difficult for, or may discourage or delay, a third party from seeking to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our stock. Mr. Carl C. Icahn owns, controls and has an interest in many companies, some of which may compete directly or indirectly with us. As a result, his interests may not always be consistent with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders.\nIn our certificate of incorporation, we renounce and provide for a waiver of the corporate opportunity doctrine as it relates to the funds affiliated with Koala, an affiliate of Mr. Carl C. Icahn, Technology Crossover Ventures, and any person or entity affiliated with these investors. As a result, Mr. Carl C. Icahn and entities controlled by him will have no fiduciary duty to present corporate opportunities to us. These exempted persons are in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. They may also pursue, for their own accounts, acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. These potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects if attractive corporate opportunities are directed by the exempted persons to themselves or their other affiliates instead of to us. As a result, corporate opportunities that may benefit us may not be available to us. To the extent that conflicts of interest may arise between us, Mr. Carl C. Icahn and his affiliates, those conflicts may be resolved in a manner adverse to us or our other shareholders.\nOn March 29, 2017, we, as borrower, and Koala, as lender, an affiliate of Carl C. Icahn, our controlling stockholder, entered into a $30 million Amended Note, which amended and restated our prior revolving note with Koala dated August 7, 2015. See Item 1 - Financing Arrangements.\nWe may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms.\nWe may incur indebtedness in the future to refinance our existing indebtedness or to finance newly acquired properties or for other purposes. Demands on our cash resources from debt service will reduce funds available to us to make capital expenditures and acquisitions or carry out other aspects of our business strategy. Our indebtedness may also limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions, make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels. Increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility, including our ability to acquire properties, finance or refinance our properties or sell properties as needed.\nFurther, our Amended Note with Koala provides a revolving loan facility of up to $30 million in aggregate principal amount (the \u201cCommitment\u201d), which provides that the net proceeds thereunder in excess of $10 million will be used by us for the acquisition, improvement, development, modification, alteration, repair, maintenance, financing or leasing of real property, including any fees and expenses associated with such activities. Our outstanding balance at December 31, 2017 totaled $5.5 million. On January 17, 2018 we borrowed an additional $0.5 million under the Amended Note to fund ongoing operating costs. If we consummate the McClatchy Purchase Agreement, we would have to borrow up to an additional $17 million under the Amended Note, which would bring our outstanding balance to approximately $23 million. We may, by written notice to Koala, request that the Commitment be increased (the \u201cIncreased Commitment\u201d), provided that the aggregate amount of all borrowings, plus availability under the aggregate Increased Commitment, shall not exceed $80 million. However, Koala has no obligation to provide any Increased Commitment and may refuse to do so in its sole discretion. If we consummate the McClatchy Purchase Agreement and are unable to increase our availability under the Amended Koala Note, or obtain other suitable financing, our ability to purchase other properties and execute our transformation plan could be materially adversely affected.\nMoreover, our ability to obtain additional financing and satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon our future operating performance, which is subject to then- prevailing general economic, real estate and credit market conditions, including interest rate levels and the availability of credit generally, and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. A prolonged worsening of credit market conditions would have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe may be unable to obtain additional financing or financing on favorable terms or our operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under any indebtedness outstanding from time to time. If financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to enhance our properties or develop new properties, complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to secure funds for future tenant improvements or capital needs, which could adversely impact the returns we generate on our properties.\nWhen tenants do not renew their leases or otherwise vacate their space, in order to attract replacement tenants, we may be required to expend substantial funds for tenant improvements and tenant refurbishments to the vacated space. In addition, we will likely be responsible for any major structural repairs, such as repairs to the foundation, exterior walls and rooftops, even if our leases with tenants may require tenants to pay routine property maintenance costs. We may use cash flow from operations, borrowings, property sales or future debt or equity offerings in order to improve or maintain our properties or for any other reason. These sources of funding may not be available on attractive terms or at all. If we cannot procure additional funding for capital improvements, our investments may generate lower cash flows or decline in value, or both, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments.\nRising expenses could reduce cash flow and funds available for future acquisitions.\nAny properties that we may buy will be subject to operating risks common to real estate in general, any or all of which may negatively affect us. If any property is not fully occupied or if rents are being paid in an amount that is insufficient to cover operating expenses, we could be required to expend funds with respect to that property for operating expenses. Any of our properties could be subject to increases in tax rates, utility costs, operating expenses, insurance costs, repairs and maintenance and administrative expenses. Leases may not be negotiated on a double- or triple-net basis or on a basis requiring the tenants to pay all or some of such expenses, in which event we may have to pay those costs. If we are unable to lease properties on a triple-net-lease basis or on a basis requiring the tenants to pay all or some of such expenses, or if tenants fail to pay required tax, utility and other impositions, we could be required to pay those costs which could adversely affect our cash flows and funds available for future acquisitions.\nCosts of complying with governmental laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental matters, may adversely affect our operations and cash position.\nAll real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. These laws and regulations generally govern wastewater and storm water discharges, air emissions, the operation and removal of underground and above-ground storage tanks, the use, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, and the remediation of contamination associated in soils or groundwater. Environmental laws and regulations may impose joint and several liabilities on tenants, owners or operators for the costs to investigate or remediate contaminated properties, regardless of fault or whether the acts causing the contamination were legal. This liability could be substantial. In addition, the presence of hazardous substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell, rent or pledge such property as collateral for future borrowings.\nSome of these laws and regulations are amended from time to time and may require compliance with new or more stringent standards in the future. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws may require material expenditures by us. Future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material environmental liability. Additionally, our tenants\u2019 operations, the existing condition of land when we buy it, operations in the vicinity of our properties, such as the presence of underground storage tanks, contamination from others in the soils or groundwater on adjoining properties, or activities of unrelated third parties may affect our properties. In addition, there are various local, state and federal fire, health, life-safety and similar regulations with which we may be required to comply, and that may subject us to liability in the form of fines or damages for noncompliance. Any material expenditures, fines, or damages we must pay could materially adversely affect our results from operations and may reduce the value of an investment in our shares. The cost of defending against claims of liability, of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury claims may materially adversely affect our business, assets or results of operations.\nEnvironmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with real estate properties owned by us may materially and adversely affect us.\nOur properties may be subject to known and unknown environmental liabilities under various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to human health and the environment. Certain of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several liabilities on certain statutory classes of persons, including owners or operators, and past owners and operators for the costs of investigation or remediation of contaminated properties. These laws and regulations apply to past and present business operations on the properties, and the use, storage, handling and recycling or disposal of hazardous substances or wastes. We may face liability regardless of our knowledge of the contamination, the timing of the contamination, the cause of the contamination or the party responsible for the contamination of the property.\nWe may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and clean-up of any of our properties on which there is contamination, or from which there has been a release or threatened release of a regulated material as well as other affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release.\nAs the owner or operator of real property, we may also incur liability based on various building conditions. The presence of significant asbestos, mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation to contain or remove the asbestos, mold or other airborne contaminants or increase ventilation and/or expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants, or others if property damage or personal injury occurs.\nIn addition to these costs, which could exceed the property\u2019s value, we could be liable for certain other costs, including governmental fines, and injuries to persons, property or natural resources. Further, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs the government incurs in connection with such contamination. Any such costs or liens could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.\nAlthough we intend to require our tenants to undertake to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities, including environmental liabilities they cause, the amount of such liabilities could exceed the financial ability of the tenant to indemnify us. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.\nWe may obtain only limited warranties when we purchase a property and would have only limited recourse if our due diligence did not identify any issues that lower the value of our property, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe seller of a property often sells such property in its \u201cas is\u201d condition on a \u201cwhere is\u201d basis and \u201cwith all faults,\u201d without any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use or purpose. In addition, purchase agreements may contain only limited warranties, representations and indemnifications that will only survive for a limited period after the closing. The purchase of properties with limited warranties increases the risk that we may lose some or all our invested capital in the property as well as the loss of rental income from that property.\nOur costs associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act may affect our operating results.\nOur properties are and will be subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the \u201cADA\u201d). Under the ADA, all places of public accommodation are required to comply with federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. The ADA has separate compliance requirements for \u201cpublic accommodations\u201d and \u201ccommercial facilities\u201d that generally require that buildings and services, including restaurants and retail stores, be made accessible and available to people with disabilities. The ADA\u2019s requirements could require removal of access barriers and could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, monetary penalties, or, in some cases, an award of damages. There is no assurance that we will be able to acquire properties or allocate the burden on the seller or other third party, such as a tenant, to ensure compliance with the ADA. If we cannot, our funds used for ADA compliance may affect our results from operations. The fluctuation in market conditions makes judging the future performance of these assets difficult. There is a risk that we may not purchase real estate assets at absolute discounted rates and that these assets may continue to decline in value.\nProperties that we may own and may acquire face competition that may decrease the amount of rent that we may charge our tenants.\nProperties that we may own and may acquire face competition for tenants. The number of competitive properties could have a material effect on our ability to rent space at our properties and the amount of rents charged. We could be adversely affected if additional competitive properties are built in locations competitive with our properties, causing increased competition for customer traffic and creditworthy tenants. This could result in decreased cash flow from tenants and may require us to make capital improvements to properties that we would not have otherwise made, thus affecting our income, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to renew leases or re-lease space as leases expire.\nIf tenants do not renew their leases upon expiration, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space. Even if the tenants do re-lease the lease or we are able to re-lease to a new tenant, the terms and conditions of the new lease may not be as favorable as the terms and conditions of the expired lease. One or more of our properties may incur a vacancy either by the continued default of a tenant under its lease or the expiration of one of our leases. In addition, the resale value of a property could be diminished because the market value of a particular property will depend principally upon the value of the cash flow generated from the property which in the case of vacancies, will be reduced.\nChanges in building and/or zoning laws may require us to renovate or reconstruct a property in connection with the continued use of the property or the commencement of a new use of the property or prevent us from fully restoring a property in the event of a substantial casualty loss and/or require us to meet additional or more stringent construction requirements.\nDue to changes, among other things, in applicable building and zoning laws, ordinances and codes that may affect certain of our properties that have come into effect after the initial construction of the properties, certain properties may not comply fully with current building and/or zoning laws, including electrical, fire, health and safety codes and regulations, use, lot coverage, parking and setback requirements, but may qualify as permitted non-conforming uses. Such changes may require updating various existing physical conditions of buildings in connection with our recapture, renovation, and/or redevelopment of properties. In addition, such changes may limit our or our tenant\u2019s ability to restore the premises of a property to its previous condition in the event of a substantial casualty loss with respect to the property or the ability to refurbish, expand or renovate such property to remain compliant, or increase the cost of construction in order to comply with changes in building or zoning codes and regulations. If we are unable to restore a property to its prior use after a substantial casualty loss or are required to comply with more stringent building or zoning codes and regulations, we may be unable to re-lease the space at a comparable effective rent or sell the property at an acceptable price, which may materially and adversely affect us.\nWe may be subject to unanticipated liabilities as a result of our real properties.\nWe may be involved in disputes and other matters with property owners, tenants, their respective employees and agents, and other unrelated parties, such as tort claims related to hazardous conditions, foreclosure actions and access disputes. We cannot assure you that we will not become subject to material litigation or other liabilities. If these liabilities are not adequately covered by insurance, they could have a material adverse impact on our results from operations.\nWe intend to enter into leases that will generally make our tenants contractually responsible for payment of taxes, maintenance, insurance and other similar expenditures associated with our tenants' use of a property. If our tenants fail to pay these expenses as required, or if we are otherwise required to pay such expenses, it could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nUnder triple net lease arrangements, tenant lease agreements typically make tenants contractually responsible for payment of taxes, maintenance, insurance and other similar expenditures associated with tenants' infrastructure assets. If our tenants fail to pay these expenses as required, it could result in a diminution in the value of the infrastructure asset associated with our real property interest and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Further, if a tenant fails to pay real property taxes, any lien resulting from such unpaid taxes would be senior to our real property interest in the applicable site. Failure to pay such real property taxes could result in our real property interest being impaired or extinguished, or we may be forced to incur costs and pay the real property tax liability to avoid impairment of our assets. We may enter into leases or acquire properties already subject to lease that are not triple net lease arrangements, including double net lease arrangements, in which case we may be primarily responsible for certain expenses, such as insurance, taxes, maintenance or other expenditures. Such obligations could have a material adverse impact on our results from operations, as could any material increase in such amounts over what we anticipate paying.\nWe or our tenants may experience uninsured or underinsured losses, which could result in a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property, decrease anticipated future revenues or cause us to incur unanticipated expenses.\nLeases that we enter into are expected to require that the tenant maintain comprehensive insurance and hazard insurance or self-insure its insurance obligations. However, there are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, which may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. Insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of a loss. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations, and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace the property after such property has been damaged or destroyed. Under such circumstances, the insurance proceeds received might not be adequate to restore the economic position with respect to such property.\nIf any of our existing properties or any other property we acquire experiences a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy coverage limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged property as well as the anticipated future cash flows from the property. In addition, even if damage to our properties is covered by insurance, a disruption of business caused by a casualty event may result in loss of revenue for our tenants or us. Any business interruption insurance may not fully compensate them or us for such loss of revenue. If one of our tenants experiences such a loss, it may be unable to satisfy its payment obligations to us under its lease with us.\nOur ability to fully control the maintenance of our net-leased properties may be limited.\nThe tenants or managers of net-leased properties are generally responsible for maintenance and other day-to-day management of the properties. If a property is not adequately maintained in accordance with the terms of the applicable lease, we may incur expenses for deferred maintenance expenditures or other liabilities once the property becomes free of the lease. While we expect our leases will generally provide for recourse against the tenant in these instances, a bankrupt or financially-troubled tenant may be more likely to defer maintenance and it may be more difficult to enforce remedies against such a tenant. In addition, to the extent tenants are unable to conduct their operation of the property on a financially-successful basis, their ability to pay rent may be adversely affected. Although we endeavor to monitor, on an ongoing basis, compliance by tenants with their lease obligations and other factors that could affect the financial performance of our properties, such monitoring may not in all circumstances ascertain or forestall deterioration either in the condition of a property or the financial circumstances of a tenant.\nReal estate investments are relatively illiquid, and therefore we may not be able to dispose of properties when appropriate or on favorable terms.\nInvestments in real properties are relatively illiquid. We may not be able to quickly alter our portfolio or generate capital by selling properties. The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand, that are beyond our control. If we need or desire to sell a property or properties, we cannot predict whether we will be able to do so at a price or on the terms and conditions acceptable to us. We cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. Further, we may be required to invest monies to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. We can make no assurance that we will have funds available to correct these defects or to make these improvements. Moreover, in acquiring a property, we may agree to restrictions that prohibit the sale of that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions, such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property. These provisions would restrict our ability to sell a property.\nAny material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting or failure to maintain proper and effective internal controls could impair our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements and investors' views of us could be harmed. The execution of our transformation plan may make it more challenging for us to maintain effective controls.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can manage our business and produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We are required to comply with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our compliance with Section 404 has required and will continue to require that we incur additional expense and expend management time on compliance-related issues. We have significantly reduced staffing in connection with the execution of our transformation plan. As a result, our maintenance of sufficient controls will be dependent on a smaller group of individuals than in the past. We currently only have two full-time employees, and a limited number of consultants, which may adversely affect our ability to maintain proper internal controls.\nIf we fail to maintain proper controls, our business could be adversely affected, our ability to predict our cash needs and the market's confidence in our financial statements could decline, and the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe impact of recently enacted U.S. tax laws is not yet clear.\nCongress recently enacted legislation commonly known as \u201cThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\u201d (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The Tax Act made significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws. Certain provisions of the Tax Act could have an adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company or its subsidiaries. The interpretations of many provisions of the Tax Act are still unclear. We cannot predict when or to what extent any U.S. federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations, or rulings clarifying the Tax Act will be issued or the impact of any such guidance on the Company. Certain key provisions of the Tax Act that could impact us include, but are not limited to, the limitations on a taxpayer\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards.\nWe may not be able to realize value from our NOLs.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had federal and state NOLs of $496 million (net of $3 million of limitations) and between $114 million and $302 million, respectively, that begin to expire in 2019, for U.S. federal income tax purposes and in 2028 for state income tax purposes. If we had an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in section 382 of the Code, our NOLs generated prior to the ownership change would be subject to annual limitations, which could reduce, eliminate, or defer the utilization of these losses. Generally, an ownership change occurs if one or more stockholders, each of whom owns 5% or more in value of a corporation\u2019s stock, increase their aggregate percentage ownership by 50 percentage points or more as compared to the lowest percentage of stock owned by such stockholders at any time during the preceding three-year period. Based upon a review of past changes in our ownership, we do not believe that we have experienced an ownership change (as defined under Section 382) that would result in any limitation on our future ability to use these NOLs. There can be no assurance however that the Internal Revenue Service or some other taxing authority will not disagree with our position and contend that we have already experienced such an ownership change, which would severely limit our ability to use our NOLs to offset future taxable income.\nIn connection with our Reorganization shares of our common stock are subject to transfer restrictions contained in our certificate of incorporation. In general, the transfer restrictions prohibit transfers having the effect of increasing without our consent the ownership of our common stock by (i) any person from less than 5% to 5% or more or (ii) any person owning or deemed to own 5% of more of our common stock.\nWhile we expect that the transfer restrictions will help guard against an ownership change occurring under Section 382 of the Code and the related rules, because we may use our common stock as consideration to make acquisitions and because we may sell additional shares of our common stock in the future to raise capital for our business, we cannot guarantee that an ownership change will not occur in the future.\nFurther, under the Tax Act, the amount of post 2017 NOLs that we are permitted to deduct in any taxable year is limited to 80% of our taxable income in such year, where taxable income is determined without regard to the NOL deduction itself. In addition, the Tax Act generally eliminates the ability to carry back any NOL to prior taxable years, while allowing post 2017 unused NOLs to be carried forward indefinitely. There is a risk that due to changes under the Tax Act, regulatory changes, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. For these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs, whether or not we attain profitability.\nWe may not be able to make use of the existing tax benefits of the NOLs because we may not generate taxable income.\nThe use of the NOLs is subject to uncertainty because it is dependent upon the amount of taxable income generated by us and our consolidated subsidiaries. Through December 31, 2017 we have not generated taxable income on an annual basis, and there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to use the NOLs before they begin expiring at varying dates starting in 2019 for U.S. federal income tax purposes and in the 2028 for state income tax purposes.\nFuture legislation may impede our ability to realize the tax benefits of the NOLs.\nIt is possible that legislation or regulations will be adopted in the future that would further limit our ability to use the tax benefits associated with the NOLs.\nThe IRS could challenge the amount of the NOLs or claim that we experienced an ownership change, which could reduce the amount of NOLs that we can use.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the amount of the NOLs has not been audited or otherwise validated by the IRS. The IRS could challenge the amount of the NOLs, which could result in an increase in our future income tax liability. The Company's U.S. federal tax return for the year ended December 31, 2013 was audited by the Internal Revenue Service and such audit was completed in 2017. No adjustments were made as a result of the audit.\nIn addition, calculating whether an ownership change has occurred is subject to uncertainty, both because of the complexity and ambiguity of Section 382 and because of limitations on a publicly traded company's knowledge as to the ownership of, and transactions in, its securities. Therefore, we cannot assure you that a governmental authority will not claim that we experienced an ownership change and attempt to reduce or eliminate the benefit of the NOLs even if we are successful in implementing the protective measures subjecting our stock to transfer restrictions.\nAny lawsuits filed against us could divert management's attention and adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn the past, lawsuits have been filed against us and certain of our former directors and officers. Although these cases have been dismissed, there is always the possibility for more suits to be brought against the Company. These types of litigation often are expensive and divert management's attention and resources. As a result, any of those claims, whether or not ultimately successful, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a result of the implementation of measures designed to protect the use of our NOLs by restricting transfers of our common stock to the extent such transfers would affect the percentage of stock that is treated as owned by a five-percent stockholder, your ability to transfer your shares of common stock and your opportunity to receive a premium on our stock may be limited.\nIn connection with our Reorganization, shares of our common stock are subject to transfer restrictions contained in our certificate of incorporation. In general, the transfer restrictions prohibit transfers without our consent having the effect of increasing the ownership of our common stock by (i) any person from less than 5% to 5% or more or (ii) any person owning or deemed to own 5% of more of our common stock. Consequently, your ability to transfer your shares of common stock may be limited.\nEven if our Board consented to a significant stock acquisition, a potential buyer might be deterred from acquiring our common stock while we still have significant tax losses being carried forward, because such an acquisition might trigger an ownership change and severely impair our ability to use our NOLs against future income. Thus, this potential tax situation could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control and, therefore, could affect adversely our shareholders' ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for our common stock in connection with a change in control. The transfer restrictions that apply to shares of our common stock, although designed as a protective measure to avoid an ownership change, may have the effect of impeding or discouraging a merger, tender offer or proxy contest, even if such a transaction may be favorable to the interests of some or all of our shareholders. This effect might prevent our stockholders from realizing an opportunity to sell all or a portion of their common stock at a premium to the prevailing market price. In addition, the transfer restrictions may delay the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of our common stock and the removal of incumbent directors and management, even if such removal may be beneficial to some or all of our stockholders.\nOur common stock is ranked junior to our Series J preferred stock with respect to cash dividends and amounts payable in the event of our dissolution, liquidation or winding up.\nWith respect to the payment of cash dividends and amounts payable in the event our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, our common stock is ranked junior to our Series J preferred stock. This means that, unless full cumulative dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding Series J preferred stock for all accrued dividends, no cash dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common stock until we have paid to our Series J preferred stockholders the liquidation preference relating to such preferred stock, plus in each case any accrued and unpaid dividends. In the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, our asset value would first inure to the benefit of holders of our Series J preferred stock, up to the value of the Series J preferred stock liquidation preference plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, before holders of our common stock would realize any benefits from such increase.\nWe have not paid or declared common stock cash dividends in the past, and do not plan to pay or declare common stock cash dividends in the future, and, as a result, your only opportunity to achieve a return on an investment in our common stock is if the price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock other than the distribution of subscription rights in the rights offerings that closed in October 2012 and March 2015. We do not expect to declare or pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Instead, we anticipate that all of our earnings in the foreseeable future will be used in the operation and growth of our business and the payment of dividends on our Series J preferred stock. Any determination to pay dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is currently limited by the terms of our Series J preferred stock and may be further restricted by the terms of any future debt or preferred securities. Accordingly, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in our common stock may be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit. The market price for our common stock may never exceed, and may fall below, the price that you paid for such common stock.\nWe currently have fewer than 300 stockholders of record and, therefore, are eligible to terminate the registration of our common stock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nAs a public company with fewer than 300 stockholders of record, we currently register our shares of common stock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), on a voluntary basis. Section 12(g)(4) of the Exchange Act allows for the registration of any class of securities to be terminated 90 days after a company files a certification with the SEC that the number of holders of record of such class of security is fewer than 300 persons. Accordingly, we are eligible to deregister our common stock under the Exchange Act. Upon the effectiveness of the termination of registration under Section 12, we would not be required to comply with certain disclosure requirements under the Exchange Act, including, but not limited to, proxy statement filings and filings by insiders to disclose the acquisition and disposition of our securities. Even if we were to deregister, however, Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act would require us to continue to file annual, quarterly and current reports until no earlier than when we file our next annual report on Form 10-K. At such time, you may not have access to current information about our Company.", "PERMNO": 93433, "SIC": 6512, "TIC": "VLTC"}
