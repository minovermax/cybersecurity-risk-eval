{"cik": "946454", "company": "BALLANTYNE STRONG, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business and financial performance are subject to various risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. We discuss in this section some of the risk factors that, if they actually occurred, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment. You should consider these risk factors in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect subsequent events or circumstances or the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing governmental responses have negatively impacted, and could further materially adversely affect, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a widespread and detrimental effect on the global economy as a result of the continued increase in the number of cases, particularly in the United States, and actions by public health and governmental authorities, businesses, other organizations and individuals to address the outbreak, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place, stay at home or total lock-down orders and business limitations and shutdowns. The COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing governmental responses have materially negatively impacted, and could further materially adversely affect, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and results of operations remains unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, including variants thereof and any repeat or cyclical outbreaks, and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or we or our customers, may direct, which may result in an extended period of continued business disruption and reduced operations. For instance, some areas of the United States are experiencing new surges in COVID-19 cases and new variants of COVID-19, which has, in some cases, led to the closure of recently re-opened businesses and further postponed opening other businesses, including movie theaters. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but we expect it will continue to have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe repercussions of the COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in a significant impact to our customers, specifically those in the entertainment and advertising industries, and their ability and willingness to purchase our products and services, which continues to negatively impact us. A significant number of our customers temporarily ceased operations during the pandemic, some of which continue to be suspended; as such, we have experienced, and anticipate that we will continue to experience at least until our customers have resumed normal operations, a significant decline in our results of operations. For instance, during this time, many movie theaters and other entertainment centers were forced to close or curtail their hours and, correspondingly, have terminated or deferred their non-essential capital expenditures. While some movie theaters and chains have begun to re-open, or announced plans to re-open in the near future, theater operators may continue to experience reduced revenues for an extended period due to, among other things, consumer concerns over safety and social distancing, depressed consumer sentiment due to adverse economic conditions, including job losses, capacity restrictions, and postponed release dates, shortened \u201crelease windows\u201d between the release of motion pictures in theaters and an alternative delivery method, or the release of motion pictures directly to alternative delivery methods, bypassing the theater entirely, for certain movies, and continued COVID-19 outbreaks could cause these theaters to suspend operations again. The COVID-19 pandemic has also adversely affected film production and may adversely affect the pipeline of feature films available in the short- or long-term. In addition to decreased business spending by our customers and prospective customers and reduced demand for our products, lower renewal rates by our customers, increased customer losses/churn, increased challenges in or cost of acquiring new customers and increased risk in collectability of accounts receivable may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We have also experienced other negative impacts; among other actions, we were required to temporarily close our screen manufacturing facility in Canada due to the governmental response to COVID-19, which we were able to re-open on May 11, 2020, and have experienced lower revenues from field services and a reduction in non-recurring time and materials-based services. The completion of our outsourced screen finishing facility in China by a third party was also delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. We may also experience one or more of the following conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial condition: adverse effects on our strategic partners\u2019 businesses or on the businesses of companies in which we hold equity stakes; impairment charges; extreme currency exchange-rate fluctuations; inability to recover costs from insurance carriers; and business continuity concerns for us, our customers and our third-party vendors.\nIn response to uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken significant steps to preserve cash and remain in a strong competitive position when the current crisis subsides by eliminating non-essential costs, reducing employee hours and deferring all non-essential capital expenditures to minimum levels. Among other mitigating actions, we implemented targeted furloughs, temporarily curtailed our service and distribution activities in the United States and temporarily reduced compensation of our executive officers and certain other employees, and our board of directors waived its cash compensation for 2020. We have also implemented remote work policies for many employees, and the resources available to such employees may not enable them to maintain the same level of productivity and efficiency. In addition, these and other employees may face additional demands on their time, such as increased responsibilities resulting from school and childcare closures or illness of family members. Our increased reliance on remote access to our information systems also increases our exposures to potential cybersecurity breaches. We cannot provide any assurance that these actions, or any other mitigating actions we may take, will help mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on us.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that our assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements will remain accurate due to the unprecedented nature of the disruption to our operations and the unpredictability of the COVID-19 global pandemic. As a consequence, our estimates of the duration of the pandemic and the severity of the impact on our future earnings and cash flows could change and have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we applied for and received wage subsidies, and are in the process of reviewing tax credits and other financial support under the newly enacted COVID-19 relief legislation in the U.S. and Canada. However, the legislation and guidance from the authorities continues to evolve; as such, the amount and timing of support, if any, that we could receive is not determinable at this time, and there can be no guarantees that we will receive financial support through these programs. In addition, certain government benefits that we seek to access have not previously been administered on the present scale or at all. Government or third-party program administrators may be unable to cope with the volume of applications in the near term, and any benefits we receive may not be as extensive as we currently estimate, may impose additional conditions and restrictions on our operations or may otherwise provide less relief than we contemplate. In the event of a sustained market deterioration, and continued declines in net sales, including the impact of such events on the borrowing base under the Strong/MDI credit facilities, we may need additional liquidity, which would require us to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate actions. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain additional sources of financing or liquidity on acceptable terms, or at all.\nThe ultimate duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is dependent on future developments, the duration of the pandemic, including repeat or cyclical outbreaks, new and potentially more contagious variants, additional \u201cwaves\u201d and the related length of its impact on the global economy, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time due to the daily evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global responses to curb its spread. Furthermore, the extent to which our mitigation efforts are successful, if at all, is not presently ascertainable. However, we expect that our results of operations, including revenues, in future periods will continue to be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and its negative effects on global economic conditions, which include a global recession, and that, as result of such effects, we may continue to be adversely affected even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided.\nWe have no assurance of future business from any of our customers.\nWe estimate future revenue associated with customers and customer prospects for purposes of financial planning and measurement of our sales pipeline, but we have limited contractual assurance of future business from our customers. While we do have arrangements with some of our customers, customers are not required to purchase any minimum amounts, and could stop doing business with us. Some customers maintain simultaneous relationships with our competitors, and could shift more of their business away from us if they choose to do so in the future.\nThere is no guarantee that we will be able to service and retain or renew existing agreements, maintain relationships with any of our customers or business partners on acceptable terms or at all, or collect amounts owed to us from insolvent customers or business partners. The loss of any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur operating results could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products and services and adequately manage our inventory.\nTo ensure adequate inventory supply, we forecast inventory needs, place orders and plan personnel levels based on estimates of future demand. Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products and services is limited and could be affected by many factors, including an increase or decrease in customer demand for our products and services or for products and services of our competitors, product and service introductions by competitors, unanticipated changes in general market conditions, effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions. If we fail to accurately forecast customer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of products available for sale. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand for our products and services, we may not be able to deliver products to meet requirements, and this could result in damage to our brand and customer relationships and adversely affect our revenue and operating results.\nInterruptions of, or higher prices of, components from our suppliers may affect our results of operations and financial performance.\nA portion of our revenues are dependent on the distribution of products supplied by various key suppliers. If we fail to maintain satisfactory relationships with our suppliers, or if our suppliers experience significant financial difficulties, we could experience difficulty in obtaining needed goods and services. Some suppliers could also decide to reduce inventories or raise prices to increase cash flow. The loss of any one or more of our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business, and we may be unable to secure alternative manufacturing arrangements. Even if we are able to obtain alternative manufacturing arrangements, such arrangements may not be on terms similar to our current arrangements, or we may be forced to accept less favorable terms in order to secure a supplier as quickly as possible so as to minimize the impact on our business operations. In addition, any required changes in our suppliers could cause delays in our operations and increase our production costs and new suppliers may not be able to meet our production demands as to volume, quality or timeliness.\nChanges in general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions, domestic and foreign trade policies, monetary policies and other factors beyond our control may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nOur operations and performance may depend on global, regional, economic and geopolitical conditions. Russia\u2019s invasion and military attacks on Ukraine have triggered significant sanctions from North American and European leaders. These events are currently escalating and creating increasingly volatile global economic conditions. Resulting changes in North American trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by Russia, its allies and other affected countries, including China, resulting in a \u201ctrade war.\u201d A trade war could result in increased costs for raw materials that we use in our manufacturing and could otherwise limit our ability to sell our products abroad. These increased costs would have a negative effect on our financial condition and profitability. Furthermore, the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine may increase the likelihood of supply interruptions and further hinder our ability to find the materials we need to make our products. If the conflict between Russia and Ukraine continues for a long period of time, or if other countries become further involved in the conflict, we could face significant adverse effects to our business and financial condition.\nEnvironmental, social and governance matters may impact our business and reputation.\nIncreasingly, in addition to the importance of their financial performance, companies are being judged by their performance on a variety of environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters, which are considered to contribute to the long-term sustainability of companies\u2019 performance.\nA variety of organizations measure the performance of companies on ESG topics, and the results of these assessments are widely publicized. In addition, investment in funds that specialize in companies that perform well in such assessments are increasingly popular, and major institutional investors have publicly emphasized the importance of ESG measures to their investment decisions. Topics taken into account in such assessments include, among others, companies\u2019 efforts and impacts on climate change and human rights, ethics and compliance with law, diversity and the role of companies\u2019 board of directors in supervising various sustainability issues.\nESG goals and values are embedded in our core mission and vision, and we consider their potential impact on the sustainability of our business over time and the potential impact of our business on society. However, in light of investors\u2019 increased focus on ESG matters, there can be no certainty that we will manage such issues successfully, or that we will successfully meet society\u2019s expectations as to our proper role. This could lead to risk of litigation or reputational damage relating to our ESG policies or performance.\nFurther, possible actions to address ESG issues may not maximize short-term financial results and may yield financial results that conflict with the market\u2019s expectations. We have and may in the future make business decisions that may reduce our short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our ESG goals, which we believe will improve our financial results over the long-term. These decisions may not be consistent with the short-term expectations of our stockholders and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our business, financial condition, and operating results could be harmed.\nThe markets for our products and services are highly competitive and if market share is lost, we may be unable to lower our cost structure quickly enough to offset the loss of revenue.\nThe domestic and international markets for our product lines are highly competitive, evolving and subject to rapid technological and other changes. We expect the intensity of competition in each of these areas to continue in the future for a number of reasons including:\n\u25cf Certain of our competitors in the digital equipment industry have longer operating histories and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do, which, among other things, may permit them to adopt aggressive pricing policies. As a result, we may suffer from pricing pressures that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and our results of operations. Some of our competitors also have greater name and brand recognition and a larger customer base than us.\n\u25cf Some of our competitors are manufacturing their own digital equipment while we employ a distribution business model through our distribution agreements with NEC Display Solutions of America, Inc. (\u201cNEC\u201d), Barco, Inc. (\u201cBarco\u201d) and certain other suppliers. As a result, we may suffer from pricing pressures that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.\n\u25cf Suppliers could decide to utilize their current sales force to supply their products directly to customers rather than utilizing channels.\nIn addition, we face competition for consumer attention from other forms of entertainment, including streaming services and other forms of entertainment that may impact the cinema industry. The other forms of entertainment may be more attractive to consumers than those utilizing our technologies, which could harm our business, prospects and operating results.\nFor these and other reasons, we must continue to enhance our technologies and our existing products and services, and introduce new, high-quality technologies and products and services to meet the wide variety of competitive pressures that we face. If we are unable to compete successfully, our business, prospects and results of operations will be materially adversely impacted.\nWe depend in part on distributors, dealers and resellers to sell and market our products and services, and our failure to maintain and further develop our sales channels could harm our business.\nIn addition to our in-house sales force, we sell some of our products and services through distributors, dealers and resellers. As we do not have long-term contracts and these agreements may be cancelled at any time, any changes to our current mix of distributors could adversely affect our gross margin and could negatively affect both our brand image and our reputation. If our distributors, dealers and resellers are not successful in selling our products, our revenue would decrease. Specifically, the shutdowns of local and state economies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue in the future to adversely affect the operations of our dealers and resellers. In addition, our success in expanding and entering into new markets internationally will depend on our ability to establish relationships with new distributors. If we do not maintain our relationship with existing distributors or develop relationships with new distributors, dealers and resellers our ability to grow our business and sell our products and services could be adversely affected and our business may be harmed.\nOur capital allocation strategy may not be successful, which could adversely impact our financial condition.\nWe intend to continue investing part of our cash balances in public and private companies and may engage in mergers, acquisitions and divestitures. We intend our holdings in public companies to be made in circumstances where we believe that we will be able to exercise some degree of influence or control. We may also continue to invest in private companies or other areas, including acquisitions of businesses. Currently, our holdings are highly concentrated in two public companies, FGF and GreenFirst, and one private company, Firefly. In some cases, funds controlled by our affiliate Fundamental Global have, and may in the future, acquire positions in the same public companies as us. These types of holdings are riskier than holding our cash balances as bank deposits or, for example, conservative options such as treasury bonds or money market funds. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or enhance the value or the performance of the companies in which we have invested or may invest in the future, or that we will achieve returns or benefits from these holdings. Under certain circumstances, significant declines in the fair values of these holdings may require the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment losses. We may lose all or part of our holding relating to such companies if their value decreases as a result of their financial performance or for any other reason. If our interests differ from those of other investors in companies over which we do not have control, we may be unable to effect any change at those companies. We are not required to meet any diversification standards, and our holdings may continue to remain concentrated. In addition, we may seek to sell some or all of our existing businesses as part of our holding company strategy.\nIf our capital allocation strategy is not successful or we achieve less than expected returns from these holdings, it could have a material adverse effect on us. The Board of Directors may also change our capital allocation strategy at any time, and such changes could further increase our exposure, which could adversely impact us.\nIf we are unable to maintain our brand and reputation, our business, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed.\nOur business, results of operations and prospects depend, in part, on maintaining and strengthening our brand and reputation for providing high quality products and services. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions. Although reputations may take decades to build, any negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. If problems with our products cause operational disruption or other difficulties, or there are delays or other issues with the delivery of our products or services, our brand and reputation could be diminished. Damage to our reputation could also arise from actual or perceived legal violations, product safety issues, data security breaches, actual or perceived poor employee relations, actual or perceived poor service, actual or perceived poor privacy practices, operational or sustainability issues, actual or perceived ethical issues or other events within or outside of our control that generate negative publicity with respect to us. Any event that has the potential to negatively impact our reputation could lead to lost sales, loss of new opportunities and retention and recruiting difficulties. If we fail to promote and maintain our brand and reputation successfully, our business, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed.\nOur operating margins may decline as a result of increasing product costs.\nOur business is subject to pressure on pricing and costs caused by many factors, including supply chain disruption, intense competition, the cost of components used in our products, labor costs, constrained sourcing capacity, inflationary pressure, pressure from customers to reduce the prices we charge for our products and services, and changes in consumer demand. While inflation has been relatively low in recent years, it began to increase in the second half of 2021. Factors including global supply chain disruptions have resulted in shortages in labor, materials and services. Such shortages have resulted in cost increases, particularly for labor, and could continue to increase. Costs for the raw materials used to manufacture our products are affected by, among other things, energy prices, demand, fluctuations in commodity prices and currency, shipping costs and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control such as the escalating military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Increases in the cost of raw materials used to manufacture our products or in the cost of labor and other costs of doing business internationally could have an adverse effect on, among other things, the cost of our products, gross margins, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOur sales cycle can be long and timing of orders and shipments unpredictable, particularly with respect to large enterprises, which could harm our business and operating results.\nThe timing of our sales is difficult to predict, and customers typically order screen and other distribution products with limited advance notice which impacts our ability to forecast revenue and manage operations. For our managed service offerings, the sales cycle can be long and involve educating and achieving buy-in from multiple parts of a customer organization. As a result, the length and variable nature of customer ordering patterns and timing could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe are substantially dependent upon significant customers who could cease purchasing our products at any time.\nOur top ten customers accounted for 38% of 2021 net consolidated revenues. Trade accounts receivable from these customers represented 29% of net consolidated receivables at December 31, 2021. Most arrangements with these customers are made by purchase order and are terminable at will by either party. A significant decrease or interruption in business from our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernment agencies in Canada have notified Strong/MDI that certain modifications are required to be made to the Joliette Plant in order to meet safety and emissions standards.\nStrong/MDI has been informed by certain government agencies in Canada, including but not limited to, the Joliette Fire Department, and the Quebec Ministry of the Environment, that certain aspects of the Joliette Plant must be modified to fully comply with safety and emissions standards. Strong/MDI has implemented changes to address some, but not all, of the identified requirements.\nThe required modifications include installing new air evaluator and exhaust chimneys as well as modifying the walls and doors in the paint and coatings area to achieve a 2-hour fire resistance standard. In addition, it was required that we modify certain mezzanine areas to reduce their size and upgrade construction to non-combustible materials, add an additional exterior access, and purchase spill resistant pallets. We estimate that if we were to proceed with implementing the remaining identified requirements, the cost would be approximately CAD$0.3 million to CAD$0.5 million (approximately USD$0.2 million to USD$0.4 million) if undertaken on their own and not as part of a broader plant improvement initiative. Our intention is to address the remaining requirements as one component of an expansion and reorganization of the certain areas of the Joliette Plant. We believe the project would improve production flow in the plant, accommodate growth of the Eclipse product line in addition to addressing the requirements. We estimate that the cost of an expansion and reorganization of the Joliette Plant, which includes the estimated costs to remedy the remaining required modifications, would be approximately CAD$1.0 million to CAD$1.5 million (approximately USD$0.8 million to USD$1.2 million), depending on the final scope of the expansion as well as fluctuations in construction materials and other costs. If we fail to address the requirements, it could be possible that we could incur penalties or production could be interrupted. The expansion could cost more or take longer than our expectations and could result in production disruptions in the facility during the construction process.\nOur business is subject to the economic and political risks of selling products in foreign countries.\nSales outside the United States accounted for approximately 17% of consolidated revenues during 2021. We expect that international sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future. Foreign sales are subject to general political and economic risks, including the adverse impact of changes to international trade and tariff policies, including in the U.S. and China, which have created uncertainty regarding international trade, unanticipated or unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations, unfavorable changes in U.S. policies on international trade and investment, the imposition of governmental economic sanctions on countries in which we do business, quotas, capital controls or other trade barriers, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocks, threats of war, terrorism or governmental instability, currency controls, fluctuating exchange rates with respect to sales not denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in import/export regulations, tariffs and freight rates, potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies, restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of a country and the disruption of operations from labor, political and other disturbances, such as the impact of the coronavirus and other public health epidemics or pandemics. Government policies on international trade and investment can affect the demand for our products, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell or manufacture products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, a government\u2019s adoption of \u201cbuy national\u201d policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations. If we were unable to navigate the foreign regulatory environment, or if we were unable to enforce our contract rights in foreign countries, our business could be adversely impacted. Any of these events could reduce our sales, limit the prices at which we can sell our products, interrupt our supply chain or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance.\nIn addition, a portion of our foreign sales are denominated in foreign currencies and amounted to approximately USD$1.5 million in 2021. To the extent that orders are denominated in foreign currencies, our reported sales and earnings are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations. In addition, there can be no assurance that our remaining international customers will continue to accept orders denominated in U.S. dollars. For those sales which are denominated in U.S. dollars, a weakening in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse impact on us by increasing the effective price of our products in international markets. Certain areas of the world are also more cost conscious than the U.S. market and there are instances where our products are priced higher than local manufacturers. We are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations between the Canadian and U.S. dollar due to our screen manufacturing facility in Canada where a majority of its sales are denominated in the U.S. dollar while its expenses are denominated in Canadian currency. We cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect our foreign activities and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe risk of non-compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our international operations could have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations and strategic objectives.\nOur global operations subject us to regulation by U.S. federal and state laws and multiple foreign laws, regulations and policies, which could result in conflicting legal requirements. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and increase our cost of doing business. These laws and regulations include import and export control, environmental, health and safety regulations, data privacy requirements, international labor laws and work councils and anti-corruption and bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.N. Convention Against Bribery and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials. We are subject to the risk that we, our employees, our affiliated entities, contractors, agents or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents may take action determined to be in violation of any of these laws. An actual or alleged violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil or criminal penalties, debarment from government contracts, curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, competitive or reputational harm, litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and strategic objectives.\nIn addition, we are subject to Canadian and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act. In general, these laws prohibit a company and its employees and intermediaries from bribing or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. Failure by us or our predecessors to comply with the applicable legislation and other similar foreign laws could expose us and our senior management to civil and/or criminal penalties, other sanctions and remedial measures, legal expenses and reputational damage, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Likewise, any investigation of any alleged violations of the applicable anti-corruption legislation by Canadian or foreign authorities could also have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA reversal of the U.S. economic recovery and a return to volatile or recessionary conditions in the United States or abroad could adversely affect our business or our access to capital markets in a material manner.\nWorsening economic and market conditions, downside shocks, or a return to recessionary economic conditions could serve to reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our operating results. These economic conditions may also impact the financial condition of one or more of our key suppliers, which could affect our ability to secure product to meet our customers\u2019 demand. In addition, a downturn in the cinema market could impact the valuation and collectability of certain receivables held by us. Our results of operations and the implementation of our business strategy could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy, including conditions that are outside of our control, such as the impact of health and safety concerns from the current outbreak of COVID-19 and variants thereof. The most recent global financial crisis caused by the coronavirus resulted in extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business and could have a material adverse effect on us. We could also be adversely affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency rates and weak economic and political conditions in each of the countries in which we sell our products.\nWe rely extensively on our information technology systems and are vulnerable to damage and interruption.\nWe rely on our information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business, including maintaining client and supplier information. Additionally, we utilize third parties, including cloud providers, to store, transfer and process data. From time to time, we experience cyber-attacks on our information technology systems. Our information technology systems, as well as the systems of our customers, suppliers and other partners, whose systems we do not control, are vulnerable to outages and an increasing risk of continually evolving deliberate intrusions to gain access to company sensitive information. Likewise, data security incidents and breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to our systems pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. A cyber-attack or other significant disruption involving our information technology systems, or those of our customers, suppliers and other partners, could also result in disruptions in critical systems, corruption or loss of data and theft of data, funds or intellectual property. We may be unable to prevent outages or security breaches in our systems. We remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or yet unknown threats as, in some instances, we, our suppliers and our other partners may be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. We also face the risk that we expose our customers or partners to cybersecurity attacks. Any or all of the foregoing could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows, as well as our business reputation.\nAny failure to maintain the security of information relating to our customers, employees and suppliers, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, could expose us to litigation, government enforcement actions and costly response measures, and could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and reputation.\nIn connection with the sales and marketing of our products and services, we may from time to time transmit confidential information. We also have access to, collect or maintain private or confidential information regarding our customers, employees, and suppliers, as well as our business. We face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our information technology networks and related systems. These risks include operational interruption, private data exposure and damage to our relationship with our customers, among others. Cyber-attacks are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated. It is possible that computer hackers and others might compromise our security measures, or security measures of those parties that we do business with now or in the future, and obtain the personal information of our customers, employees and suppliers or our business information. A security breach of any kind, including physical or electronic break- ins, computer viruses and attacks by hackers, employees or others, could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation, government enforcement actions, regulatory penalties and costly response measures, and could seriously disrupt our operations. Any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation, which could cause us to lose market share and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we fail to retain key members of management, or successfully integrate new executives, our business may be materially harmed.\nOur future success depends, in substantial part, on the efforts and abilities of our current management team. If certain of these individuals were to leave unexpectedly, we could experience substantial loss of institutional knowledge, face difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss in productivity while any successor obtains the necessary training and experience. Our loss of services of any of our senior executives, or any failure to effectively integrate new management into our business processes, controls, systems and culture, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThere are risks associated with the completion of the planned separation and initial public offering of shares of common stock of our Strong Entertainment operating business.\nWe plan to conduct an initial public offering of our Strong Entertainment operating business after which the Entertainment business will operate independently as a publicly listed company. There is no assurance we will be able to successfully complete the separation and initial public offering. In the event the Company does not complete the separation and offering, it could incur write-offs related to the legal, tax and regulatory costs of the transaction.\nIn addition, if the separation and initial public offering is successful, the Entertainment business will then operate as an independent company. Although Ballantyne Strong will be a large shareholder and have the ability to influence operating decisions, it will no longer directly control all day to day decision making or have direct access to the operating cash flows of that business following the separation.\nAny potential future acquisitions, strategic investments, entry into new lines of business, divestitures, mergers or joint ventures may subject us to significant risks, any of which could harm our business.\nOur long-term strategy may include identifying and acquiring, investing in or merging with suitable candidates on acceptable terms, entry into new lines of business and markets or divesting of certain business lines or activities. In particular, over time, we may acquire, make investments in or merge with providers of product offerings that complement our business or may terminate such activities. Mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and entries into new lines of business include a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf diversion of management attention from running our existing business;\n\u25cf possible material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting;\n\u25cf increased expenses including legal, administrative and compensation expenses related to newly hired or terminated employees;\n\u25cf increased costs to integrate, develop or, in the case of a divestiture, separate the technology, personnel, customer base and business practices of the acquired, new or divested business or assets;\n\u25cf potential exposure to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process;\n\u25cf potential adverse effects on reported results of operations due to possible write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with acquisitions;\n\u25cf potential damage to customer relationships or loss of synergies in the case of divestitures; and\n\u25cf unavailability of acquisition financing or inability to obtain such financing on reasonable terms.\nAny acquired business, technology, service or product, or entry into a new line of business could significantly under-perform relative to our expectations, and may not achieve the benefits we expect. For all these reasons, our pursuit of an acquisition, investment, new line of business, divestiture, merger or joint venture could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.\nFailure to effectively utilize or successfully assert intellectual property rights could negatively impact us.\nWe own or otherwise have rights to various trademarks and trade names used in conjunction with the sale of our products, the most significant of which is Strong\u00ae. We rely on trademark laws to protect these intellectual property rights. We cannot assure that these intellectual property rights will be effectively utilized or, if necessary, successfully asserted. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights, or, where appropriate, license from others, intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions. Our intellectual property rights, and any additional rights we may obtain in the future, may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future. Our failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could harm our competitive position and could negatively impact us.\nNatural disasters and other catastrophic events beyond our control could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as fires, hurricanes, tornados, tsunamis, floods and earthquakes; geo-political events, such as civil unrest in a country in which our suppliers are located or terrorist or military activities disrupting transportation, communication or utility systems; or other highly disruptive events, such as nuclear accidents, public health epidemics or pandemics, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of which is uncertain and which, if it persists for an extended period of time, could disrupt our global supply chain and result in significant expenses or delays outside of our control, unusual weather conditions or cyber-attacks, could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and could further impact our operations, customers and suppliers as a result of quarantines, facility closures, and travel and logistics restrictions. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, and include the duration, severity and scope of the outbreak and the actions taken to contain or treat the coronavirus outbreak. In addition, temporary cinema closures in domestic and foreign markets and delays to movie release schedules may potentially negatively impact our customers\u2019 operations and timing of orders. Further, adverse events such as health-related concerns about working in our offices, the inability to travel and other matters affecting the general work environment could harm our business. In the event of a major disruption caused by the outbreak of epidemics or pandemic diseases such as coronavirus, we may lose the services of our employees or experience system interruptions, which could lead to diminishment of our business operations. Such events could result, among other things, in operational disruptions, physical damage to or destruction or disruption of one or more of our properties or properties used by third parties in connection with the supply of products or services to us, the lack of an adequate workforce in parts or all of our operations and communications and transportation disruptions. We cannot anticipate all the ways in which the current global health crisis and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business. These factors could also cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States and global financial markets and economy. Such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on us and could also have indirect consequences such as increases in the costs of insurance if they result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage.\nThe insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures.\nWe maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. We are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail. Additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers. In the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain.\nFundamental Global, with its affiliates, is our largest shareholder, and its interests may differ from the interests of our other stockholders.\nThe interests of Fundamental Global may differ from the interests of our other stockholders. Fundamental Global and its affiliates hold approximately 30.3% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of March 15, 2022. Mr. Cerminara, the Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder and Partner of Fundamental Global, serves as our Chairman of our Board of Directors. As a result of its ownership position and Mr. Cerminara\u2019s position with the Company, Fundamental Global could exert influence over matters submitted to stockholder approval, including the election of our directors, and other corporate actions such as amendments to our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, significant stock issuances, mergers and asset sales, and over our business, operations, and management, including the strategic plans for the business. Fundamental Global may have interests that differ from those of our other stockholders and may vote in a way with which our other stockholders disagree and which may be adverse to their interests. Fundamental Global\u2019s ownership position may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of the Company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are entering a new line of business which could require additional capital.\nThe production, acquisition and distribution of feature films and series content requires substantial capital. We intend to mitigate risks by pre-selling rights to content and utilizing tax credit incentives in most cases to offset production costs. However, a significant amount of time may elapse between our expenditure of funds and the receipt of revenues after release or distribution of such content. Although we intend to reduce the risks of production exposure through pre-sale of rights, tax credit programs, government and industry programs, co-financiers and other sources, we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement these arrangements or that we will not be subject to substantial financial risks relating to the production, acquisition and distribution of content. Additionally, the production, completion and distribution of motion picture and television content can be subject to a number of uncertainties, including delays and increased expenditures due to disruptions or events beyond our control. As a result, if production incurs substantial budget overruns, we may have to seek additional financing or fund the overrun ourselves. We cannot make assurances regarding the availability of such additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or that we will recoup these costs. For instance, increased costs or budget overruns incurred with respect to a particular film may prevent a picture from being completed or released or may result in a delayed release and the postponement to a potentially less favorable date, all of which could cause a decline in performance, and, thus, the overall financial success of such film. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nWe may incur significant write-offs if our projects do not perform well enough to recoup costs.\nWe will be required to amortize capitalized content production costs over the expected revenue streams as we recognize revenue from films or other projects. The amount of production costs that will be amortized each quarter depends on, among other things, how much future revenue we expect to receive from each project. Unamortized production costs will be evaluated for impairment each reporting period on a project-by-project basis. If estimated remaining revenue is not sufficient to recover the unamortized production costs, including because of delayed theatrical distribution of films as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic and its effects, those costs would be written down to fair value. In any given quarter, if we lower our previous forecast with respect to total anticipated revenue from any film or other project, we may be required to accelerate amortization or record impairment charges with respect to the unamortized costs, even if we previously recorded impairment charges for such film or other project. Such impairment charges could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur revenues and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nOur revenues and results of operations can vary based on the timing of shipments of our cinema products particularly with regard to the timing of cinema screen shipments and timing of customer orders and shipments of projection equipment. With the launch of Strong Studios, those fluctuations could increase on a quarter-to-quarter basis as timing of revenue and amortization of production costs will depend on timing delivery of content, among other factors. The degree of commercial success of content that we sell, license or distribute, which cannot be predicted with certainty may cause our revenue and earnings results to fluctuate significantly from period to period, and the results of any one period may not be indicative of the results for any future periods.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell shares of common stock.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile in the past and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results, general conditions in the industries in which we operate and other factors, including the risk factors described in this section. In addition, the stock market is subject to price and volume fluctuations affecting the market price for the stock of many companies generally, which fluctuations often are unrelated to operating performance. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, making it difficult for you to resell shares of common stock owned by you at times or prices you find attractive.", "PERMNO": 82234, "SIC": 3861, "TIC": "BTN"}
