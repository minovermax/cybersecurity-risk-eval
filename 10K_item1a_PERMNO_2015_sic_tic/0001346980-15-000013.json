RISK FACTORS\nThe following are some of the important factors that could affect our financial performance or could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates contained in our forward-looking statements. We may encounter risks in addition to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may also impair or adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nOil and gas price volatility, including the recent decline in oil and gas prices, could adversely affect our financial condition, financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to grow.\nOur future financial condition, revenues, results of operations, rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend primarily upon the prices we receive for our oil and gas production. Oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, especially given current geopolitical conditions. This price volatility also affects the cash flow we will have available for capital expenditures as well as our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. The prices for oil and gas are subject to a variety of factors that are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\noil and natural gas processing, gathering and transportation availability, and the availability of refining capacity;\n\u2022\nthe price and level of foreign imports of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u2022\nthe supply of CO2;\n\u2022\nthe supply of other inputs necessary to our production;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuel sources;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\nfinancial and commercial market uncertainty;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions or hostilities in oil and natural gas producing regions, including the Middle East and South America; and\n\u2022\nworldwide economic conditions.\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets generally make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and gas price movements with any certainty. For example, during the five years prior to December 31, 2014, the posted price for West Texas Intermediate light sweet crude oil, commonly referred to as West Texas Intermediate or WTI, has ranged from a low of $53.45 per barrel, or Bbl, in December 2014 to a high of $113.39 per Bbl in April 2011. The Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of $1.82 per million British thermal units, or MMBtu, in April 2012 to a high of $8.15 per MMBtu in February 2014. Over the past several months, oil prices have declined from over $105.00 per Bbl in June 2014 to below $45.00 per Bbl in January 2015 due in large part to increasing supplies and weakening demand growth, and have remained low compared to prices in the first half of 2014.\nLower oil and natural gas prices for an extended period would not only reduce our revenue, but could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce economically, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and reserves. We could also determine during periods of low commodity prices to shut in or curtail production from our wells and to defer drilling new wells challenging our ability to produce at commercially paying quantities required to hold our leases.\nIf commodity prices remain at current levels for an extended period, we may, among other things, be unable to meet our financial obligations, including payments on our senior secured revolving credit facility and our senior notes, or be unable to make planned capital expenditures.\nWe expect to write down the carrying values of our properties in 2015 if oil and natural gas prices remain low, and further price declines could result in additional write-downs in the future, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our oil and natural gas properties. Under this method, all costs incurred for both productive and nonproductive properties are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis using the units-of-production method. However, these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of estimated future net revenues attributable to proved oil and gas reserves discounted at 10%,\nadjusted for derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges and net of tax considerations, plus the cost of unproved properties not being amortized. The full cost ceiling is evaluated at the end of each quarter using the SEC prices for oil and natural gas in effect at that date as adjusted for our derivative positions deemed \u201ccash flow hedge positions.\u201d A write-down of oil and natural gas properties does not impact cash flow from operating activities, but does reduce net income. Once incurred, a write-down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date.\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile and this and other factors, without mitigating circumstances, could require us to further write down capitalized costs and incur corresponding non-cash charges to earnings. Any such further write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We did not have a ceiling test write-down in 2012, 2013 or 2014. Due to the substantial decline of commodity prices during the third and fourth quarters of 2014, which have remained low during the first quarter of 2015, we anticipate that we will have a ceiling test write-down during 2015. It is difficult to predict with reasonable certainty the amount of expected future impairments given the many factors impacting the ceiling test calculation including, but not limited to, future pricing, operating costs, upward or downward reserve revisions, reserve adds, and tax attributes.\nThe actual quantities and present value of our proved reserves may be lower than we have estimated.\nEstimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves is a complex process. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various estimates and assumptions, including estimates based upon assumptions relating to economic factors such as oil and natural gas prices, production costs, severance and excise taxes, capital expenditures, workovers, remedial costs, and the assumed effect of governmental regulation. There are numerous uncertainties about when a property may have proved reserves as compared to possible or probable reserves, including with respect to our EOR operations. Reserve estimates are, therefore, inherently imprecise and, although we are reasonably certain of recovering the quantities we disclose as proved reserves, actual results will vary from our estimates. Any significant variations in the interpretations or assumptions underlying our estimates or changes of conditions (e.g. economic growth and/or regulation) could cause the estimated quantities and net present value of our reserves to differ materially. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and developmental drilling, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by operators on adjacent properties.\nYou should not assume that the present values referred to in this report represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. The timing of production and expenses associated with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect both the timing of actual future net cash flows from our proved reserves and their present value. In accordance with requirements of the SEC, the estimates of present values are based on a twelve-month average price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the twelve-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of these estimates. In addition, the effects of derivative instruments are not reflected in these assumed prices. Our December 31, 2014 reserve report used prices of $4.35 per Mcf for natural gas, $94.99 per Bbl for oil and $36.10 per Bbl for natural gas liquids. These prices are substantially higher than the current and expected 2015 prices for oil and natural gas.\nA significant portion of total proved reserves as of December 31, 2014 are undeveloped, and those reserves may not ultimately be developed.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately 42% of our estimated proved reserves (by volume) were undeveloped. These reserve estimates reflect our plans to make significant capital expenditures to convert our proved undeveloped reserves into proved developed reserves including approximately $0.8 billion during the five years ending in 2019. You should be aware that actual development costs may exceed estimates, development may not occur as scheduled and results may not be as estimated. If we choose not to develop our proved undeveloped reserves, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop them, we will be required to remove the associated volumes from our reported proved reserves. In addition, under the SEC\u2019s reserve reporting rules, proved undeveloped reserves generally may be booked only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking. We may be required to write off any reserves that are not developed within this five-year time frame unless such reported reserves are otherwise exempted from the SEC\u2019s five-year reporting rules.\nSome of our reserves are subject to EOR methods and the failure of these methods may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and reserves.\nOf our 57.5 million MMBoe of reserves on our active EOR properties as of December 31, 2014, 43.1 MMBoe were based on EOR methods including the injection of CO2 and represent approximately 27% of our total proved reserves. Some of these properties have not been injected with CO2 and recovery factors cannot be estimated with precision. Accordingly, such projects may not result in significant proved reserves or improvements in anticipated production levels.\nWe do not currently have a supply of CO2 for all of our unproved properties with CO2 EOR potential, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such a supply on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, many of our planned EOR projects\nwill require significant investments in pipeline, compression facilities, and other infrastructure, and we may need to raise additional capital to fund these projects. We cannot assure you that such funding will be available on commercially reasonable terms. The availability of CO2 supply and financing of CO2 projects could affect the timing of our planned EOR programs and impact our ability to implement such plans.\nOur ability to develop our EOR reserves will depend on whether we can successfully implement our planned EOR programs, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and reserves.\nLimitations or restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur operations require significant amounts of water for drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to obtain water from local sources may require us to find remote sources. In addition, treatment and disposal or such water after use is becoming more highly regulated and restricted. Thus, costs for obtaining and disposing of water could increase significantly, potentially limiting our ability to engage in hydraulic fracturing. This could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nThe development of the proved undeveloped reserves in our active EOR projects may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate.\nAs of December 31, 2014, undeveloped reserves comprised 47% of the total estimated proved reserves of our active EOR projects. As of December 31, 2014, we expect to incur future development costs of $1.0 billion, including $306.0 million for CO2 purchase, compression and transportation, over the next 30 years to substantially develop these reserves. The future development costs for our active EOR projects are 60% of our total estimated future development and abandonment costs of $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2014. Development of these reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. In addition, the development of these reserves will require the use of EOR techniques, including water flood and CO2 injection installations, the success of which is still subject to interpretation and predictability by reservoir engineers. Therefore, ultimate recoveries from these fields may not match current expectations.\nCompetition in the oil and gas industry is intense and many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do.\nWe operate in the highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas production, acquisition, development, and exploration and face intense competition from both major and other independent oil and gas companies:\n\u2022\nseeking to acquire desirable producing properties or new leases for future development or exploration; and\n\u2022\nseeking to acquire the equipment and expertise necessary to operate and develop our properties.\nMany of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours, and some of them are fully integrated oil companies. These companies may be able to pay more for development prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. Our ability to develop our oil and natural gas properties and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend upon our ability to successfully conduct operations, select suitable prospects and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment.\nSignificant capital expenditures are required to replace our reserves.\nOur development, exploration, and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flows from operations, debt financing, private issuances of common stock and proceeds from asset sales. Future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, prices of oil and natural gas, and our success in developing and producing new reserves. If our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund our capital expenditure budget, we may not be able to access additional bank debt or other methods of financing on commercially reasonable terms to meet these requirements. If revenue were to decrease as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices or decreased production, and our access to capital were limited, we would have a reduced ability to replace our reserves which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are not able to replace reserves, we may not be able to sustain production.\nOur future success depends largely upon our ability to find, develop, or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful development, exploration or acquisition activities, our proved reserves and production will decline over time. In addition, approximately 42% of our total estimated proved reserves (by volume) at December 31, 2014 were undeveloped. By their nature, estimates of undeveloped reserves are less certain. Recovery of such reserves will require significant capital expenditures and successful drilling and EOR operations. Our December 31, 2014 reserve estimates reflect that our production rate on current proved developed producing reserve properties will decline at annual rates of approximately 21%, 14%, and 12% for the next three years. Thus, our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows are highly\ndependent on our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically discovering or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. Due to lower oil prices, we are significantly reducing capital expenditures in 2015 which will result in lower than average replacement of reserves when compared to previous years.\nDevelopment and exploration drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves.\nDrilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that commercially productive reservoirs will not be encountered. We cannot assure you that new wells we drill will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or may be economically recovered and/or produced. Drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit at then-realized prices after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. These risks are magnified when operating in an environment of low crude oil prices like we are currently experiencing in the the United States. Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\npressure or lost circulation in formations;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\ndecline in commodity prices;\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental requirements; and\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, equipment and services.\nIf, for any reason, we are unable to economically recover reserves through our exploration and drilling activities, our results of operations, cash flows, growth, and reserve replenishment may be materially affected.\nA significant portion of our operations are located in Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a limited number of major geographic areas.\nAs of December 31, 2014, almost 100% of our proved reserves and production was located in the Mid-Continent geographic area. This concentration could disproportionately expose us to operational and regulatory risk in this area. This lack of diversification in location of our key operations could expose us to adverse developments in our operating areas or the oil and natural gas markets, including, for example, transportation or treatment capacity constraints, curtailment of production or treatment plant closures for scheduled maintenance. These factors could have a significantly greater impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows than if our properties were more geographically diversified.\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental and safety regulations, which can adversely affect the cost, manner, and feasibility of doing business.\nOur operations and facilities are subject to certain federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for, and development, production, and transportation of, oil and gas, as well as environmental and safety matters. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and are currently evaluating the extent of applicability and preparing to comply to the extent applicable with proposed and newly adopted greenhouse gas reporting and permitting requirements, we cannot be certain that existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or future laws or regulations will not harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may be required to make large and unanticipated capital expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations such as:\n\u2022\nland use restrictions;\n\u2022\ndrilling bonds and other financial responsibility requirements;\n\u2022\nspacing of wells;\n\u2022\nreporting on emissions of greenhouse gases;\n\u2022\npermitting of emissions of greenhouse gases and other regulated air pollutants;\n\u2022\nunitization and pooling of properties;\n\u2022\nhabitat and endangered species protection, reclamation and remediation, and other environmental protection;\n\u2022\nwell stimulation processes;\n\u2022\nproduced water disposal;\n\u2022\nCO2 pipeline requirements;\n\u2022\nsafety precautions;\n\u2022\noperational reporting; and\n\u2022\ntaxation.\nUnder these laws and regulations, we could be liable for:\n\u2022\npersonal injuries;\n\u2022\nproperty and natural resource damages;\n\u2022\noil spills and releases or discharges of hazardous materials;\n\u2022\nwell reclamation costs;\n\u2022\nremediation and clean-up costs and other governmental sanctions, such as fines and penalties;\n\u2022\nother environmental damages; and\n\u2022\nadditional reporting, permitting or other issues arising from emissions of greenhouse gases and other regulated air pollutants;\n\u2022\nand fines, penalties, and / or consent orders for non-compliance with the Clean Air Act.\nOur operations could be significantly delayed or curtailed and our costs of operations could significantly increase as a result of regulatory requirements or restrictions. Additionally, regulations promulgated pursuant to the Clean Air Act or other mandatory federal legislation requiring monitoring and reporting of air pollutant emissions continue to evolve and may impose new restrictions on these emissions resulting in liability for exceeding permitted air pollutant emission rates or other mandatory caps on greenhouse gas emissions. While we are preparing for compliance with newly adopted requirements, at this time we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements as they continue to evolve or their effect on our operations.\nProperties that we acquire may not produce as projected and we may be unable to accurately predict reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with the properties, or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities.\nAcquisitions of producing and undeveloped properties have been an important part of our historical growth. We expect acquisitions will also contribute to our future growth. Successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors, including recoverable reserves, exploration or development potential, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, and potential environmental and other liabilities. We perform an engineering, geological and geophysical review of the acquired properties, which we believe is generally consistent with industry practices, and also endeavor to evaluate environmental risks. However, such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain for a number of reasons. For instance, in connection with our assessments, such a review may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not physically inspect every well. Even when we inspect a well, we do not always discover structural, subsurface and environmental problems that may exist or arise. Our review prior to signing a definitive purchase agreement may be even more limited. Often we are not entitled to contractual indemnification for pre-closing liabilities, including environmental liabilities associated with acquired properties. Normally, we acquire interests in properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties. Additionally, properties previously acquired have not been subject to greenhouse gas requirements which have recently been adopted. As a result, significant unknown liabilities, including environmental liabilities, may exist and we may experience losses due to title defects in acquisitions for which we have limited or no contractual remedies or insurance coverage. These risks are magnified during a period of lower oil prices like we are currently experiencing in the United States. In addition, we may acquire oil and natural gas properties that contain economically recoverable reserves which are less than predicted. Thus, liabilities and uneconomically feasible oil and natural gas recoveries related to our acquisitions of producing and undeveloped properties may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and reserve growth.\nWe cannot control the activities on properties we do not operate and we are unable to ensure the proper operation and profitability of these non-operated properties.\nWe do not operate all of the properties in which we have an interest. As a result, we have limited ability to exercise influence over, and control the risks associated with, the operation of these properties. The success and timing of drilling and development activities on our partially owned properties operated by others therefore will depend upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the operator\u2019s:\n\u2022\ntiming and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nexpertise and diligence in adequately performing operations and complying with applicable agreements;\n\u2022\nfinancial resources;\n\u2022\ninclusion of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u2022\nuse of technology.\nAs a result of any of the above or an operator\u2019s failure to act in ways that are in our best interest, our allocated production revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf the third parties we rely on for gathering and distributing our oil and natural gas are unable to meet our needs for such services and facilities, our future exploration and production activities could be adversely affected.\nThe marketability of our production depends upon the proximity of our reserves to, and the capacity of, third-party facilities and third-party services, including oil and gas gathering systems, pipelines, trucking or terminal facilities, and refineries or processing facilities. Such third parties are subject to federal and state regulation of the production and transportation of oil and gas. If such third parties are unable to comply with such regulations and we are unable to replace such service and facilities providers, we may be required to shut-in producing wells or delay or discontinue development plans for our properties. A shut-in, delay or discontinuance could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe loss of our Chief Executive Officer or other key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend, and will continue to depend in the foreseeable future, on the services of Mark A. Fischer, our Chief Executive Officer, and other officers and key employees with extensive experience and expertise in evaluating and analyzing producing oil and natural gas properties and drilling prospects, maximizing production from oil and natural gas properties, marketing oil and gas production, and developing and executing financing and hedging strategies. Our ability to retain our officers and key employees, or hire replacements if we should lose one or more, is important to our continued success and growth. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on our business.\nOil and gas drilling and production operations can be hazardous and may expose us to environmental or other liabilities.\nOil and gas operations are subject to many risks, including well blowouts, cratering, explosions, pipe failure, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine or well fluids, hydraulic fracturing fluids, toxic gas or other pollutants and other environmental and safety hazards and risks. Our drilling operations involve risks from high pressures and from mechanical difficulties such as stuck pipes, collapsed casings and separated cables. If any of these events occur, we could sustain substantial losses as a result of:\n\u2022\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u2022\nsevere damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022\npollution or other environmental damage;\n\u2022\nclean-up responsibilities;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations and administrative, civil and criminal penalties; and\n\u2022\ninjunctions or other proceedings that suspend, limit or prohibit operations.\nOur liability for environmental hazards sometimes includes those created on properties prior to the date we acquired or leased them. While we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks described above, our insurance may not be adequate to cover any or all resulting losses or liabilities. Moreover, if we experience more insurable events, our annual premiums may increase further or we may not be able to obtain any such insurance on commercially reasonable terms. The occurrence of, or failure by us to obtain or maintain adequate insurance coverage for, any of the events listed above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as our growth, exploration, and employee recruitment activities.\nCosts of environmental liabilities could exceed our estimates and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur operations are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, which obligate us to install and maintain pollution controls and to clean up various sites at which regulated materials may have been disposed of or released. It is not possible for us to estimate reliably the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of:\n\u2022\nthe uncertainties in estimating clean up costs;\n\u2022\nthe discovery of additional contamination or contamination more widespread than previously thought;\n\u2022\nthe uncertainty in quantifying liability under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties;\n\u2022\nchanges in interpretation and enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nfuture changes to environmental laws and regulations and their enforcement.\nAlthough we believe we have established appropriate reserves for known liabilities, including clean up costs, we could be required to set aside additional reserves in the future due to these uncertainties, incur material clean up costs, other liabilities, and/\nor expend significant sums to defend ourselves against litigation related to legacy environmental issues, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our long-term indebtedness, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our senior secured revolving credit facility, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our long-term indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. The indentures governing our senior notes and our senior secured revolving credit facility restrict our ability to use the proceeds from asset sales. We may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or to sell assets at prices that we believe are fair, and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our long-term indebtedness, we will be in default and, as a result:\n\u2022\ndebt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable;\n\u2022\nwe may be in default under our master (ISDA) derivative contracts and counterparties could demand early termination;\n\u2022\nthe lenders under the senior secured revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan us money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings; and\n\u2022\nwe could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nOur level of indebtedness may adversely affect our operations and limit our growth.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our total long-term indebtedness, including current maturities, was $1.6 billion. As of March 31, 2015, our total long-term indebtedness, including current maturities, was approximately $1.7 billion, and the borrowing base under our senior secured revolving credit facility was $650.0 million. Effective April 1, 2015, the borrowing base under our senior secured revolving credit facility was reduced from $650.0 million to $550.0 million. The borrowing base is based part on oil, natural gas and NGL prices and the value of our reserves. Many considerations, including but not limited to a significant decline in prices, a significant increase in operating costs, a downward revision of reserves, or other factors, could decrease our borrowing base. We may incur additional indebtedness, including significant secured indebtedness, in order to make future acquisitions or to develop our properties for production or for other purposes, and we expect to continue to be highly leveraged in the foreseeable future. Covenants set forth in the indentures for our senior notes, including the Adjusted Consolidated Net Tangible Asset debt incurrence test (the \u201cACNTA test\u201d), limit the amount of secured debt we can incur. Certain thresholds set forth in the ACNTA test are principally reliant upon the levels of commodity prices for crude oil and gas at specified dates.\nOur high level of indebtedness affects our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe restrictions imposed on the operation of our business by the terms of our debt agreements may hinder our ability to take advantage of strategic opportunities to grow our business;\n\u2022\nwe must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest on our senior notes and our other indebtedness, which reduces the funds available to us for operations and other purposes;\n\u2022\nwe may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, restructuring, acquisitions, or general corporate purposes may be impaired, which could be exacerbated by further volatility in the credit markets;\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited;\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business; and\n\u2022\nwe may be vulnerable to interest rate increases, as our borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility are at variable rates.\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects, and ability to satisfy our debt obligations.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to repay bank borrowings if required as a result of a borrowing base redetermination.\nAvailability under our senior secured revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base, which will be $550 million as of April 1, 2015, and which is set by the banks semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. In addition, the banks may request a borrowing base redetermination once between each scheduled redetermination and in the event of early termination of our derivative contracts. If we issue Additional Permitted Debt, as defined in our senior secured revolving credit facility, the borrowing base will be automatically reduced by an amount equal to 25% of the aggregate stated principal amount of the debt issued, unless otherwise agreed to by our lenders. If the outstanding borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility were to exceed the borrowing base as a result of a redetermination, we would be required to eliminate this excess. Within 10 days after receiving notice of the new borrowing base, we would be required to make an election: (1) to repay a portion of our bank borrowings in the amount of the excess either in a lump sum within 30 days or in equal monthly installments over a six-month period; (2) to submit within 30 days additional oil and gas properties we own for consideration in connection with the determination of the borrowing base sufficient to eliminate the excess or (3) to eliminate the excess through a combination of repayments and the submission of additional oil and gas properties within 30 days. If we are forced to repay a portion of our bank borrowings, we may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments. If we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing, we may have to sell significant assets. Any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nOur use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses or reduce our income.\nTo reduce our exposure to the volatility in the price of oil and gas and provide stability to cash flows, we enter into derivative positions, some of which we had previously designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. As of December 31, 2014, we had entered into commodity hedges covering 34,170 BBtu of our natural gas, 10,618 MBbls of our oil and natural gas liquids production for 2015 through 2016. Our commodity hedges are comprised of fixed price swaps, enhanced price swaps, basis protection swaps and three way collars. The volumes and average notional prices of these hedges are disclosed in \u201cNote 6 -Derivative instruments\u201d in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. The fair value of our oil and gas derivative positions outstanding as of December 31, 2014 was an asset of approximately $251.6 million.\nDerivative instruments expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u2022\nour production is less than expected;\n\u2022\nthe counterparty to the derivative instruments defaults on its contractual obligations; or\n\u2022\nthere is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the derivative instruments.\nDerivatives also expose us to risk of income reduction as derivative instruments may limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and gas. Additionally, none of our derivatives are classified as hedges for accounting purposes and therefore must be adjusted to fair value through income each reporting period.\nWhile the primary purpose of our derivative transactions is to protect us from the volatility in oil and natural gas prices, under certain circumstances, or if hedges are deemed ineffective, discontinued, or terminated for any reason, we may incur substantial losses in closing out our positions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur working capital could be adversely affected if we enter into derivative instruments that require cash collateral.\nThe use of derivatives may, in some cases, require the posting of cash collateral with counterparties (i.e. margin requirements). Although we currently do not, and do not anticipate that we will in the future, enter into derivative transactions that require an initial deposit of cash collateral, our working capital, and by extension, our growth, could be impacted if we enter into derivative transactions that require cash collateral and if commodity prices move in a manner adverse to us, we may be required to meet margin calls. Future collateral requirements are uncertain and will depend on arrangements with our counterparties and highly volatile oil and gas prices.\nWe are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks.\nOur future success depends on our ability to access capital markets and obtain financing on reasonable terms. Our ability to access financial markets and obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms in the future is dependent on a number of factors, many of which we cannot control, including changes in:\n\u2022\nour credit ratings;\n\u2022\ninterest rates;\n\u2022\nthe structured and commercial financial markets;\n\u2022\nmarket perceptions of us or the oil and gas exploration and production industry; and\n\u2022\nour tax burden due to new tax laws.\nAssuming a constant debt level of $650.0 million, equal to our borrowing base at December 31, 2014 (our only variable interest rate facility), the cash flow impact for a 12-month period resulting from a 100 basis point movement in interest rates, regardless of whether the spread widens or tightens, would be $6.5 million. As a result, any increases in our interest rates, or our inability to access the equity markets on reasonable terms, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nThe concentration of accounts for our commodity sales, joint interest billings, or hedging with third parties could expose us to credit risk.\nSubstantially all of our accounts receivable result from commodity sales or joint interest billings to third parties in the energy industry. The concentration of customers and joint interest owners may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions. Historically, we have not experienced any material credit losses on our receivables. Future concentrations of sales of oil and gas to a limited number of customers, combined with decreases in commodity prices could result in adverse effects.\nIn addition, our oil and natural gas swaps or other hedging contracts expose us to credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties. Generally, these contracts are with major investment grade financial institutions and historically we have not experienced any credit losses. We believe that the guarantee of a fixed price for the volume of oil and natural gas hedged reduces volatility in our reported results of operations, financial position and cash flows from period to period and lowers our overall business risk. However, as also discussed along with other risks specific to hedging activities, we may be exposed to greater credit risk in the future.\nRegulation related to global warming and climate change could have an adverse effect on our operations and demand for oil and gas.\nThe U.S. Congress has previously considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide among others, which some studies have suggested may be contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere. However, federal legislation to reduce greenhouse gases appears uncertain. As a result, regulation of greenhouse gases will continue to result primarily from regulatory action by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or by the several states that have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.\nFederal regulation. EPA has adopted regulations requiring Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d) permitting of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources. As a result of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA finding that greenhouse gases fall within the CAA\u2019s definition of \u201cair pollutant,\u201d the EPA was required to determine whether concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere \u201cendanger\u201d public health or welfare, and whether emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles may \u201ccause or contribute\u201d to this endangerment. On December 15, 2009, EPA promulgated its final rule, \u201cEndangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act\u201d. On May 7, 2010, EPA and the Department of Transportation\u2019s National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration, or NHTSA, promulgated a final action establishing a national program providing new standards for certain motor vehicles to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel economy. While these motor vehicle regulations do not directly impact oil and gas production operations, they can automatically trigger application of the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\u201cPSD\u201d) and Title V Operating Permit programs for stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions, potentially including oil and gas production operations. On June 3, 2010, EPA promulgated its \u201cPrevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule,\u201d to add new higher thresholds of 75,000 tons per year carbon dioxide equivalents (\u201cCO2e\u201d) for modifications to existing sources and 100,000 tons per year CO2e for new sources.\nEPA has promulgated separate regulations requiring greenhouse gas emission reporting from certain industry sectors, including natural gas production. On October 30, 2009, EPA promulgated a final mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule which will assist EPA in developing policy approaches to greenhouse gas regulation. This reporting rule became effective on December 29, 2009. On November 30, 2010, EPA promulgated additional mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rules that apply specifically to oil and gas production for implementation in 2011.\nOn August 16, 2012, EPA promulgated new CAA regulations addressing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other criteria pollutants, \u201cOil and Natural Gas Sector: New Source Performance Standards and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants Reviews.\u201d These new rules are intended to broaden the current scope of EPA\u2019s regulation to include standards governing emissions from most operations associated with oil and natural gas production facilities, natural gas transmission and storage facilities. EPA states that greenhouse gases will be controlled indirectly as a result of these new rules. Among other things, these new rules require the use of reduced emission completions or \u201cgreen completions\u201d on all hydraulically\nfractured gas wells completed or refractured after January 1, 2015. They also set new requirements for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydraters, storage vessels and other affected production equipment.\nRecent case law. Beyond legislative and regulatory developments, litigation against energy industry sectors emitting greenhouse gases have arisen based upon common law claims, that may expose us, as a potentially source of significant direct and indirect emission of greenhouse gases, to similar litigation risk.\nInternational treaties. Other nations have already agreed to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, also known as the \u201cKyoto Protocol,\u201d an international treaty pursuant to which participating countries (not including the United States) agreed to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases to below 1990 levels by 2012.\nInternational developments, passage of state or federal climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives, the adoption of regulations by EPA and analogous state agencies that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business, or development of caselaw allowing claims based upon greenhouse gas emissions, could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition as a result of material increases in operating and production costs and litigation expense due to expenses associated with monitoring, reporting, permitting and controlling greenhouse gas emissions or litigating claims related to emissions of greenhouse gases, as well as reduced demand for fossil fuels generally.\nPotential legislative and regulatory actions could increase our costs, reduce our revenue and cash flow from commodity sales, reduce our liquidity or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business.\nIn recent years the administration of President Obama made budget proposals which, if enacted into law by Congress, would potentially increase and accelerate the payment of federal income taxes by independent producers of oil and gas. Proposals have included, but have not been limited to, repealing the enhanced oil recovery credit, repealing the credit for oil and gas produced from marginal wells, repealing the expensing of intangible drilling costs, repealing the deduction for the cost of qualified tertiary expenses, repealing the exception to the passive loss limitation for working interests in oil and gas properties, repealing the percentage depletion allowance, repealing the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies, and increasing the amortization period of geological and geophysical expenses. In 2009, 2010, and 2011, legislation which would have implemented the proposed changes was introduced but not enacted. It is unclear whether legislation supporting any of the above described proposals, or designed to accomplish similar objectives, will be introduced or, if introduced, would be enacted into law or, if enacted, how soon resulting changes would become effective. However, the passage of any legislation designed to implement changes in the U.S. federal income tax laws similar to the changes included in the budget proposals offered by the White House in in recent years could eliminate certain tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development, and any such changes (i) could make it more costly for us to explore for and develop our oil and gas resources and (ii) could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition for experienced technical personnel may negatively impact our operations or financial results.\nOur continued drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced explorationists, engineers and other professionals. Competition for these professionals remains strong and we are likely to continue to experience increased costs to attract and retain these professionals. Retention of our current employees is made more critical in light of our recent workforce reduction. Following the recent drop in oil and natural gas prices, in an effort to reduce costs and better position ourselves for ongoing efficient growth, we committed to a Company-wide restructuring that included a workforce reduction of 121 employees in our headquarters office and the release of approximately 59 field personnel.\nFederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and waste water injector wells could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nCongress has previously considered legislation to amend the federal Safe Drinking Water Act to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production. Sponsors of bills previously considered before the Senate and House of Representatives have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies. The proposed legislation would require the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process, which is already required by some state agencies governing our operations. Such disclosure could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In addition, these bills, if adopted, could repeal the exemptions for hydraulic fracturing from the Safe Drinking Water Act.\nThese federal legislative efforts have slowed while EPA studies the issue of hydraulic fracturing. In 2010, EPA initiated a Hydraulic Fracturing Research Study to address concerns that hydraulic fracturing may affect the safety of drinking water, as well as review the application of other environmental statutes to hydraulic fracturing activities, including the RCRA and the Clean\nWater Act. As part of that process, EPA requested and received information from the major fracturing service providers regarding the chemical composition of fluids, standard operating procedures and the sites where they engage in hydraulic fracturing. In February 2011, EPA released its Draft Plan to Study the Potential Impacts of Hydraulic Fracturing on Drinking Water Resources, proposing to study the lifecycle of hydraulic fracturing fluid and providing a comprehensive list of chemicals identified in fracturing fluid and flowback/produced waste. EPA expects to release a draft assessment report for peer review and comment in early 2015.\nWe conduct oil and natural gas exploration, development and drilling activities in Oklahoma and elsewhere. In recent years, Oklahoma has experienced a significant increase in earthquakes and other seismic activity. Some parties believe that there is a correlation between the operation of underground injection wells for the disposal of produced water and the increased occurrence of earthquakes. The extent of this correlation, if any, is the subject of studies by both state and federal agencies, the results of which remain uncertain.\nThese developments, as well as increased scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing and underground injection activities by state and municipal authorities may result in additional levels of regulation or complexity with respect to existing regulations that could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.\nIncreased regulatory requirements regarding CO2 pipeline integrity may require us to incur significant capital and operating expenses to comply.\nThe ultimate costs of compliance with CO2 pipeline integrity regulations are difficult to predict. The majority of the compliance costs are for pipeline integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary. We plan to continue our efforts to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by the U.S. DOT rules. The results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our CO2 pipelines. In addition, new laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future, or a revised interpretation of existing laws and regulations, could significantly increase the amount of these costs. We cannot be assured about the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity regulation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs, or additional operating restrictions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are responsible for the decommissioning, abandonment, and reclamation costs for our facilities, which could decrease funds available for servicing our debt obligations and other operating expenses.\nWe are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the decommissioning, abandonment and reclamation of our facilities at the end of their economic life, the costs of which may be substantial. It is not possible to predict these costs with certainty since they will be a function of regulatory requirements at the time of decommissioning, abandonment and reclamation. We may, in the future, determine it prudent or be required by applicable laws or regulations to establish and fund one or more decommissioning, abandonment and reclamation reserve funds to provide for payment of future decommissioning, abandonment and reclamation costs, which could decrease funds available to service debt obligations. In addition, such reserves, if established, may not be sufficient to satisfy such future decommissioning, abandonment and reclamation costs and we will be responsible for the payment of the balance of such costs.\nUnusual weather patterns or natural disasters, whether due to climate change or otherwise, could negatively impact our financial condition.\nOur business depends, in part, on normal weather patterns across the United States. Natural gas demand and prices are particularly susceptible to seasonal weather trends. Warmer than usual winters can result in reduced demand and high season-end storage volumes, which can depress prices to unacceptably low levels. In addition, because a majority of our properties are located in Oklahoma,Texas and Louisiana, our operations are constantly at risk of extreme adverse weather conditions such as freezing rain, tornadoes and hurricanes. Any unusual or prolonged adverse weather patterns in our areas of operations or markets, whether due to climate change or otherwise, could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and cash flow. In addition, our business, financial condition and cash flow could be adversely affected if the businesses of our key vendors, purchasers, contractors, suppliers or transportation service providers were disrupted due to severe weather, such as freezing rain, hurricanes or floods, whether due to climate change or otherwise.\nClimate change and government laws and regulations related to climate change could negatively impact our financial condition.\nScientific studies suggest emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as \"greenhouse gases\" (\"GHGs\") and including carbon dioxide and methane, may contribute to warming of the earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes. In response to such studies, Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs. One bill approved\nby the House of Representatives in June 2009, known as the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, would have required an 80% reduction in emissions of GHGs. In addition. Many states have taken measures to reduce emissions of GHGs through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Most cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of GHGs. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. As the number of GHG emission allowances declines each year, the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate significantly. Some states have enacted renewable portfolio standards, which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy from renewable fuel sources.\nIn addition, in December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other \"greenhouse gases\" (\"GHGs\") present an endangerment to human health and the environment, because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings by the EPA allow the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. In response to its endangerment finding, the EPA adopted two sets of rules regarding possible future regulation of GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act. The motor vehicle rule, which became effective in January 2011, purports to limit emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles. The EPA adopted the stationary source rule (or the \"tailoring rule\") in May 2010, and it became effective in January 2011. The tailoring rule established new GHG emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\u201cPSD\u201d) and Title V of the Clean Air Act. In June 2014, the Supreme Court held that stationary sources could not become subject to Title V permitting solely by reason of their GHG emissions. However, the Court also ruled the EPA may require installation of best available control technology for GHG emissions at sources otherwise subject to the PSD and Title V programs. On December 19, 2014, the EPA issued initial guidance on GHG permitting requirements in response to the Court's decision. In its preliminary guidance, the EPA indicated it will undertake a rulemaking action no later than December 31, 2015 to rescind any PSD permits issued under the portions of the tailoring rule that were vacated by the Court. In the interim, the EPA issued a narrowly crafted \"no action assurance\" indicating it will exercise its enforcement discretion not to pursue enforcement of the terms and conditions relating to GHGs in an EPA-issued PSD permit, and for related terms and conditions in a Title V permit.\nIn September 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the U.S., including natural gas liquids fractionators and local natural gas/distribution companies, beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. In November 2010, the EPA published a final rule expanding the GHG reporting rule to include onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. This rule requires reporting of GHG emissions from such facilities on an annual basis, with reporting beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011. In December 2014, the EPA published a proposed rule to amend the GHG Reporting Program to add reporting of GHG emissions from gathering and boosting systems, completions and workovers of oil wells using hydraulic fracturing, and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines. The rule underwent an extended public comment period, which closed on February 24, 2015.\nThe adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory requirements. Any GHG emissions legislation or regulatory programs applicable to power plants or refineries could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to other climate-related risks set forth in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, we are and will be, directly and indirectly, subject to the effects of climate change and are, and most likely will continue to be, affected by government laws and regulations related to climate change. We are currently evaluating compliance costs arising from newly adopted mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rules, and potential compliance costs arising from newly promulgated Clean Air Act reporting and permit regulations for greenhouse gas emissions. These new regulations could be preempted by new federal legislation if enacted. However, we cannot predict with any degree of certainty the ultimate effect possible climate change and government laws and regulations related to climate change will have on our operations. While it is difficult to assess the timing and effect of climate change and pending legislation and regulation related to climate change on our business, we believe that climate change and government laws and regulations related to climate change may affect: (i) the cost of the equipment and services we purchase, (ii) our ability to continue to operate as we have in the past, including drilling, completion and operating methods, (iii) the timeliness of delivery of the materials and services we need and the cost of transportation paid by us and our vendors and other providers of services, (iv) insurance premiums, deductibles and the availability of coverage, (v) the cost of utility services, particularly electricity, in connection with the operation of our properties, and (vi) factors arising from new Clean Air Act greenhouse gas permitting and, or, possible greenhouse gas legislation, in addition to previously identified factors. These potential effects depend upon, but are not limited to, the following considerations: whether and to what extent legislation is enacted, the nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions); the greenhouse gas reductions required pursuant to either existing Clean Air Act\nregulatory requirements or new greenhouse gas legislation; the cost and availability of required offsets or emissions reductions; the amount and allocation of possible allowances; costs required to improve facilities and equipment to both monitor and reduce emissions in order to comply with regulatory limits or to mitigate the financial consequences of a greenhouse gas emission limitations; changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for oil and gas we produce arising directly from legislation or regulation, and indirectly from changes in production costs. In addition, climate change may increase the likelihood of property damage and the disruption of our operations, especially in coastal states. As a result, our financial condition could be negatively impacted by significant climate change and related governmental regulation, and that impact could be material.\nThe adoption of The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price and other risks associated with our business.\nIn July of 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), which contains measures aimed at increasing the transparency and stability of the over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivative markets and preventing excessive speculation. Certain companies that use swaps or other derivatives to hedge commercial risk, referred to as end-users, are permitted to continue to use OTC derivatives under newly adopted regulations. We maintain an active price and basis protection hedging program related to the natural gas and oil we produce to manage the risk of low commodity prices and to predict with greater certainty the cash flow from our hedged production. We have used the OTC market exclusively for our natural gas and oil derivative contracts. The Dodd-Frank Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder should permit us, as an end user, to continue to utilize OTC derivatives. However, we may have increased costs or reduced liquidity in the OTC derivatives market due to the current or future regulations. Such changes could materially reduce our hedging opportunities and negatively affect our revenues and cash flow during periods of low commodity prices.\nThe listing of a species as either \u201cthreatened\u201d or \u201cendangered\u201d under the federal Endangered Species Act could result in increased costs and new operating restrictions, loss of leasehold or delays on our operations, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe federal Endangered Species Act (\u201cESA\u201d) and analogous state laws regulate a variety of activities that may have an\nadverse effect on species listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or their habitats. The designation of previously\nunidentified endangered or threatened species in areas where we operate could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject\nto operating delays, restrictions or bans. Numerous species have been listed or proposed for protected status in areas in which we\ncurrently, or could in the future, undertake operations. For instance, the American Burying Beetle and the Lesser Prairie Chicken\nboth have habitat in some areas where we operate. The presence of these protected species in areas where we\noperate could impair our ability to timely complete or carry out those operations, lose leaseholds as we may not be permitted to\ntimely commence drilling operations, cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures, and,\nconsequently, adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.", "PERMNO": 17981, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CHAPQ"}
