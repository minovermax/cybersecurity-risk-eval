{"cik": "1617227", "company": "J. Alexander's Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn connection with the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are including the following cautionary statements identifying important factors that could materially affect the Company and cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. The risks and uncertainties described below should be considered carefully, and with all the other information contained in this Annual Report, in evaluating the Company and its business.\nRisks Related to COVID-19, Health Epidemics and Food Safety\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and may further disrupt our business, and has adversely affected and may further adversely affect our net sales, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected and may continue to adversely affect our net sales, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition. Commencing in March 2020 and continuing to the present, we are experiencing unprecedented effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact guest traffic at our restaurants, make it more difficult to staff our restaurants and, in more severe cases, may cause a temporary inability to obtain supplies, increase commodity costs or cause full and partial closures of our affected restaurants, sometimes for prolonged periods of time. After restaurants were permitted to reopen for in-person dining, they have operated at, and most are expected to continue to operate at, decreased capacity to comply with governmental mandates and social distancing requirements. As of March 2021, all of our restaurants are open for in-person dining, subject to varying capacity restrictions, and we continue carry-out services in all of our restaurants. As a result of these changes to our operations, we have experienced severe decreases in net sales, while continuing to incur significant levels of expenses. There can be no assurance that other state or local authorities will allow dining rooms to remain open even at reduced capacity if there is a surge in cases of COVID-19 or variants in those locations. If federal, state or local jurisdictions determine that another closure of restaurants for dine-in services is warranted, whether temporary or prolonged, our results of operations, net sales, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition will be negatively impacted. Additionally, if prolonged increases in positive cases of COVID-19 occur, it will be difficult for us to staff our restaurants while adhering to quarantine guidelines, which could cause temporary closures of our locations. Further, we have new or additional competitors we may not otherwise face under normal operations, and we may not be able to successfully compete with such establishments. Further, we cannot predict the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on third parties with whom we do business, including suppliers and other vendors, third-party service providers, and landlords and the degree to which the impact on third parties will affect our business. To the extent these third parties are severely impacted, it may harm our business or change the way we operate\nMoreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and may continue to impact, the greater economy, causing an economic downturn and generating uncertainty related to factors that may impact our business, such as timing of any economic recovery, changes in guest spending, and changes in consumer habits in light of job losses, lower discretionary income, and higher individual debt levels. The COVID-19 pandemic may also materially adversely affect our ability to implement our growth plans, including closures of existing restaurants, delays in opening new restaurants, and delaying our ongoing exploration of strategic alternatives. These changes have materially adversely affected our net sales, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition, and may continue to materially adversely affect such aspects of our business, particularly if these changes continue for an extended period of time.\nWe have taken steps to conserve capital and cut costs, including reducing our corporate staff, deferring most non-essential capital expenditures and deferring payments to landlords and other parties in order to reduce our capital commitments and supplement our liquidity. We have also taken steps to increase availability under our loan agreement and to extend the maturities of our loans. We cannot assure you that we will be able to access the additional funds available under our loan agreement or obtain any additional payment deferrals or contract concessions sought. If we are unable to obtain additional liquidity, our operations and financial condition may be adversely affected, particularly if restaurant capacity is restricted during any worsening COVID-19 outbreaks. Depending on its duration and severity, the COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse effect on our access to financial markets and our ability to service or refinance our indebtedness.\nThe long-term impact of this or any other pandemic remains uncertain, as viruses may be transmitted through human contact, and the risk of contracting viruses could cause employees or guests to avoid gathering in public places, which has adversely impacted our operations, and could further have longer-term adverse effects on our restaurant guest traffic or the ability to adequately staff our restaurants. Additionally, it is possible that we may experience some reputational harm due to our responses to the COVID-19 pandemic that may negatively impact our business and results of operations. We will be adversely affected if government authorities impose longer-term or more stringent restrictions on public gatherings, human interactions, operations of restaurants, or mandatory closures. Even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly after we fully reopen our restaurants, any continuing perceived risk of infection or health risk may adversely affect our business, net sales, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Depending on the severity of the pandemic and our business levels, we cannot assure you that we will not be forced to or make the decision to temporarily reclose any locations for indoor dining in response to further outbreaks of COVID-19 including new variants of the virus. Further deterioration in our results from operations could prompt additional long-lived and intangible asset impairment charges, an increase in our valuation allowance relative to deferred tax assets, the write-down of other assets recorded on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets or the inability to comply with required financial debt covenants under our loan agreement. There may be other effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are not yet identified and may materially adversely affect our business. The extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business will ultimately depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the outbreak, the timing and availability of\nvaccinations and treatments to combat COVID-19, whether or not a recession occurs in the United States or globally, consumer spending, the state of the financial markets, and normal economic and operating conditions to resume. Given the uncertainty as to the extent and timing of the potential future spread or mitigation of COVID-19 and the imposition or relaxation of protective measures, we are presently unable to estimate the full impact to our future business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.\nThe pace of recovery in demand and our business may be affected by adverse economic conditions in the markets in which our restaurants are located, including job losses, corporate financial performance and spending on expense account and group dining, debt loads, diminished business travel and other factors. Moreover, while we believe our loyal guests will continue to dine with us once restrictions are relaxed or lifted, it is unclear whether guest demand will return, in part, because we cannot predict the levels of consumer confidence and spending following the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot predict the pace of recovery of our business, or the timing of a return to prepandemic net sales levels and operating results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in significant financial market volatility and uncertainty, including on the market price of our common stock. A continuation or worsening of the levels of market disruption and volatility seen during the pandemic could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic also could intensify or otherwise affect many of our other risk factors that are included in \u201cPart I-Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on 10-K and our subsequent filings, including, but not limited to, risks inherent in the restaurant industry, macroeconomic factors beyond our control, competition for guests, risks related to doing business with third parties, including vendors and suppliers, and risks related to our indebtedness. Because the COVID-19 situation is unprecedented and continuously evolving, the other potential impacts to our risk factors contained herein and that are further described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are uncertain.\nNegative publicity relating to the consumption of beef, seafood, chicken, produce and our other menu offerings, including in connection with food-borne illness, could result in reduced consumer demand for our menu offerings, which could reduce net sales.\nShifts in consumer preferences away from the kinds of food we offer, particularly beef and seafood, whether because of dietary or other health concerns or otherwise, would make our restaurants less appealing and could reduce guest traffic and/or impose practical limits on pricing. In addition, instances of food-borne illness, such as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, which is also known as BSE or mad cow disease, as well as hepatitis A, listeria, salmonella and E. coli, whether or not found in the United States or traced directly to one of our suppliers or our restaurants, could reduce demand for our menu offerings. Any negative publicity relating to these and other health-related matters may affect consumers\u2019 perceptions of our restaurants and the food that we offer, reduce guest visits to our restaurants and negatively impact demand for our menu offerings. Adverse publicity relating to any of these matters, beef in general or other similar concerns could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nHealth concerns arising from pandemics, outbreaks of viruses or other diseases, including those that are food-related, may have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe United States and other countries have experienced, or may experience in the future, outbreaks of viruses, such as norovirus, Hepatitis A, avian flu, \u201cSARS,\u201d H1N1 or \u201cswine flu,\u201d COVID-19 or \u201cCoronavirus,\u201d influenza or other diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy. However, as has been experienced with COVID-19, if a virus is transmitted by human contact, our employees or guests could become infected, or could choose, or be advised, to avoid gathering in public places, any of which events could adversely affect our restaurant guest volume, and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants, receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level. We could also be adversely affected if government authorities impose mandatory closures, seek voluntary closures, impose restrictions on operations of restaurants, or restrict the import or export of products, or if suppliers issue mass recalls of products. Even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly, the perceived risk of infection or health risk may adversely affect our business and results of operations. If a virus or disease is foodborne, or perceived to be foodborne, future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availably of certain food products and cause our guests to eat less of a product, or could reduce public confidence in food handling and/or public assembly. If we change a restaurant menu in response to such concerns, we may lose guests who do not prefer the new menu, and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new guest base to produce the sales needed to make the restaurant profitable. We also may have different or additional competitors for our intended guests as a result of such a change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors. Reputational harm due to an actual or perceived inadequacy of our response to any outbreak of infectious or foodborne disease may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Liability, loss of guest traffic or disruption of our business caused by any of the foregoing would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry, Business, and Growth Strategy\nChanges in general economic conditions, including any economic downturn or continuing economic uncertainty, consumer dining preferences and discretionary spending patterns have adversely impacted our business and results of operations in the past and may do so again.\nWe believe that consumers generally are more willing to make discretionary purchases, including upscale and high-end restaurant meals, during favorable economic conditions. The most recent economic downturn related to the COVID-19 pandemic, uncertainty and disruptions in the overall economy, including high unemployment, reduced access to credit and increased financial market volatility and unpredictability, and the related reduction in consumer confidence, negatively affected guest traffic and sales throughout our industry. If the economy experiences a new downturn, if recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic is slowed due to increased cases or a delay in vaccine rollouts, or there are significant uncertainties regarding U.S. budgetary and fiscal policies, our guests, particularly price-sensitive families and couples and cost-conscious business clientele, may reduce their level of discretionary spending, impacting the frequency with which they choose to dine out or the amount they spend on meals while dining out, and in some instances may make long-lasting changes to their spending behavior. Uncertainty in or a worsening of the overall economy, generally or in a number of our markets, and our guests\u2019 reactions to those trends could adversely affect our business.\nAdditionally, our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond quickly to changes in consumer preferences, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants. Shifts in consumer preferences away from meals at our price point or our menu offerings, whether as a result of economic, competitive or other factors, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Many of our restaurants are located in or adjacent to traditional commercial retail centers, and to an extent rely on elevated levels of retail area traffic in these areas, especially during the holiday seasons. As consumer spending patterns continue to migrate to online shopping or to boutique, local shopping resources, and away from malls and other traditional commercial retail centers, these restaurant locations may be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, we place a high priority on maintaining the competitive positioning of our restaurants, including the image and condition of our restaurant facilities and the quality of our guest experience. Consequently, we may need to evolve our restaurants in order to compete with popular new restaurant formats or concepts that emerge or for increased off-premise business, which could result in significant capital expenditures in the future for remodeling and updating.\nOur future growth depends in part on our ability to open new restaurants and operate them profitably, and if we are unable to successfully execute this strategy, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur financial success depends in part on management\u2019s ability to execute our growth strategy. One key element of our growth strategy is opening new restaurants. However, future developments, including macroeconomic changes, could cause us to re-evaluate this growth strategy. Additionally, in the past and currently related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced delays in opening restaurants, and that could happen in the future. Delays or failures in opening new restaurants and operating them profitably could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy and expected results.\nOur ability to open new restaurants on a timely basis, or at all, and operate them profitably is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including finding quality site locations; having adequate capital for construction and opening costs; engaging third-party architects and contractors; timely hiring and training skilled personnel; successfully promoting our new locations; and having adequate supply chain resources at reasonable pricing, among others.\nIt has generally been our experience that new restaurants generate operating losses while they build sales levels to maturity, with maturity typically achieved within 36 months after opening, but in certain instances it has taken considerably longer. Once the restaurant is open, how quickly it achieves a desired level of profitability is impacted by many factors, including the level of market awareness and acceptance of our restaurants when we enter new markets, as well as the availability of experienced, professional staff. Our business and profitability may be adversely affected if it takes longer than expected for our new restaurants to achieve the desired level of profitability.\nOur ability to successfully execute new restaurant development depends heavily on successful site selection. If a site does not produce the anticipated results, a restaurant location may never reach our desired level of profitability, if it becomes profitable at all. In those cases, we may be forced to close restaurants and will incur significant costs associated with our exit from those markets, including costs associated with lease terminations or potential losses on the sale of real property that we own. Additionally, previously successful restaurants may cease to produce acceptable or desired results in the future due to changes within the market in which they operate, such as a geographic shift in commercial development that results in fewer guests in the area in which we have an existing location. In those cases, if we determine that the market is still desirable, we may choose to relocate our existing restaurant or restaurants within that same market, which could result in increased costs associated with the purchase or lease of new property.\nSignificant capital is required to develop new restaurants and to maintain existing restaurants and to the extent financing is available to us, it may only be available on terms that could impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us.\nWe believe that the required capital investment in our upscale restaurants is high compared to more casual dining restaurants. Failure of a new restaurant to generate satisfactory net sales and profits in relation to its investment could result in our failure to achieve the desired financial return on the restaurant. Additionally, we may require capital beyond the cash flow provided from operations in order to open new units, which may be difficult to obtain on favorable terms, if at all. The terms of any financing we may obtain could impose restrictions on our operations, development and new financings. Further, after a restaurant is opened, we continue to incur significant capital costs associated with our strategy to reinvest in our restaurants in order to maintain the highly attractive, contemporary and comfortable environment in each of our locations that we believe our guests expect. For 2021, we intend to complete reinvestments and improvements at our existing facilities and to invest approximately $5,325 in new locations, all totaling between $10,000 and $12,000. Consequently, our ability to carry out our growth strategy and to execute on development and capital expenditure decisions that we believe to be in our long-term best interest could be limited by the availability of additional financing sources and could involve additional borrowing which would further increase our long-term debt and interest expense.\nIf our restaurants are not able to compete successfully with other restaurants, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur industry is highly fragmented and intensely competitive with respect to price, quality of service, restaurant location, ambiance of facilities and type and quality of food. A substantial number of national and regional restaurant chains and independently owned restaurants compete with us for guests, real estate and qualified management and other restaurant staff. The principal competitors for our locations are local, chef-driven restaurants and regional, high-quality restaurant chains in each of our local markets. However, we also compete with other upscale national chains. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources, have been in business longer, have greater name recognition and are better established in the markets where our restaurants are located or where we may expand. Additionally, in recent years many upscale and high-end restaurants have expanded into the smaller and midsize markets in which some of our restaurants are located. Our inability to compete successfully with other restaurants may harm our ability to maintain acceptable levels of revenue growth, limit or otherwise inhibit our ability to grow one or more of our concepts, or force us to close one or more of our restaurants.\nIf we are unable to increase our net sales or improve our margins at existing restaurants our profitability and overall results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAnother key aspect of our growth strategy is increasing same store sales across all restaurants and improving the restaurant-level margins at our restaurants. Improving same store sales and restaurant-level margins depends in part on whether we achieve revenue growth through increases in the average check or guest counts. We believe that there are opportunities to increase the average check at our restaurants through, for example, selective introduction of new profitable menu items and increases in menu pricing. However, these strategies may prove unsuccessful, especially in times of economic hardship, as guests may not order new or higher priced items. Further, we believe that part of the appeal of our restaurants is the opportunity to experience outstanding, professional service and high-quality menu items at reasonable prices. Consequently, any price increases must be balanced with our desire to meet guest expectations with respect to service and quality at a reasonable value. Modest price increases generally have not significantly impacted guest traffic; however, we expect that there is a price level at which point guest traffic would be significantly affected, and these changes could cause our net sales to decrease. If we are not able to increase our sales at existing restaurants for any reason, our profitability and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, if we are unable to maintain or improve performance at our existing restaurants, we may be required to record impairments of our long-lived assets or intangible assets in the future. We assess the potential impairment of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable. Factors considered include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner in which an asset is being used, an expectation that an asset will be disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life and significant negative industry or economic trends. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any recorded impairment to our assets. Should the value of our assets become impaired, there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur growth may strain our infrastructure and resources, which could delay the opening of new restaurants and adversely affect our ability to manage our existing restaurants.\nWe believe there are opportunities to open up to four restaurants annually, and we anticipate that we will open two locations in 2021. Our targeted growth will increase our operating complexity and place increased demands on our management as well as our human resources, purchasing and site management teams. We also need to continue to develop awareness of our concepts. This may\nrequire the commitment of a significant amount of human capital and marketing expenditures. While we have committed significant resources to expanding our current restaurant management systems, financial and management controls, information systems and online ordering platforms, if this infrastructure is insufficient to support our anticipated expansion, our ability to open new restaurants and to manage our existing restaurants could be adversely affected. If we fail to continue to improve our infrastructure or if our infrastructure becomes inadequate, we may be unable to implement our growth strategy or maintain current levels of operating performance in our existing restaurants.\nIf we are unable to successfully transition or develop restaurants under our various Grill concepts, we may experience reduced net sales and margins at these locations, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nA key element of our business model is to pursue a multiple concept strategy consisting of the development of a number of restaurant concepts competing in the upscale casual dining segment of the restaurant industry. This is intended to, among other things, allow us to avoid being identified as a chain restaurant and to operate multiple concepts in the same market. However, we may experience a decrease in guest traffic, net sales or margins related to our strategy. If consumer preferences change, acceptance of the selected Grill concept is not as strong as expected, or the existing guest base patronizing these converted locations diminishes or discontinues, net sales at these restaurants may decrease and we could be required to expend additional resources on advertising and promotion which would reduce profit margins at these locations and adversely affect our overall financial performance.\nAs a result of the limited number of restaurants or geographic concentrations within our restaurant base, we may be more exposed to economic downturns or other disruptions in certain markets that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nAt March 17, 2021, we operated 46 restaurants in 16 states. Because of our relatively small restaurant base, unsuccessful restaurants could have a more adverse effect in relation to our financial condition and results of operations than would be the case in a company with a greater number of restaurants. We currently have a high concentration of restaurants within the South Florida market, the Ohio market and the Tennessee market and may in the future have similar concentrations of restaurants within one or more overlapping markets as we execute on our growth strategy. This concentration exposes us to risks that one or more of these markets may be adversely affected by factors that are unique to that particular market, such as negative publicity, changes in consumer preferences, demographic shifts or other adverse economic impacts, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, any natural disaster, prolonged inclement weather, act of terrorism or national emergency, accident, system failure or other unforeseen event in or around regions in which we operate multiple locations could result in significant and prolonged declines in guest traffic in these geographic regions, or a temporary or permanent closing of those locations, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to seasonal and other periodic fluctuations, and past results are not indicative of future results.\nOur net sales and operating income have historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations. Net sales and operating income typically reach their highest levels during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to holiday business and the first quarter of the fiscal year due in part to the redemption of gift cards sold during the holiday season. In addition, certain of our restaurants, particularly those located in South Florida, typically experience an increase in guest traffic during the period between Thanksgiving and Easter due to an increase in population in these markets during that portion of the year. Our quarterly results have been and will continue to be affected by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated pre-opening costs, as well as any restaurant closures and exit-related costs and any asset impairments. As a result of these and other factors, our financial results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.\nHurricanes and other weather-related disturbances could negatively affect our net sales and results of operations.\nCertain of our restaurants are located in regions of the country which are commonly affected by hurricanes and tropical storms or extreme winter weather. Restaurant closures resulting from evacuations, damage or power or water outages caused by hurricanes, tropical storms, other natural disasters and winter weather could adversely affect our net sales and profitability. To the extent we maintain insurance policies or programs to mitigate the impact of these risks, our cash flows may be adversely impacted by delay in the receipt of proceeds under those policies or the proceeds may not fully offset any such losses.\nWe occupy most of our restaurants under long-term, non-cancelable leases which require ongoing rental payments and for which we may remain obligated to perform under even after a restaurant closes, and we may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms.\nWe are a lessee for the majority of our restaurant locations, which may be either ground leases or improved leases. Many of our current leases are non-cancelable and typically have terms ranging from approximately 15 to 20 years and provide for rent escalations and for one or more five-year renewal options. We are generally obligated to pay the cost of property taxes, insurance and\nmaintenance under such leases, and certain of our leases provide for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of sales at the leased location. We believe that leases that we enter into in the future will be on substantially similar terms. Payments under our operating leases account for a significant portion of our operating expenses. We depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease obligations and to fulfill our other cash needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from borrowings under our credit facility or other sources, we may not be able to meet our operating lease obligations, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we were to close or fail to open a restaurant at a location we lease, we would generally remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, which could include, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Our obligation to continue making rental payments and fulfilling other lease obligations in respect of leases for closed or unopened restaurants could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Alternatively, at the end of the lease term and any renewal period for a restaurant, we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost, if at all, or renewals may be subject to higher rents. If we cannot renew such a lease, or cannot renew at a reasonable cost, we may be forced to close or relocate a restaurant, which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks. If we are required to make payments under one of our leases after a restaurant closes, or if we are unable to renew our restaurant leases, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Supply Chain and Employees\nIncreases in the prices of, and/or reductions in the availability of commodities, primarily beef and seafood, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur profitability is dependent in part on our ability to purchase food commodities which meet our specifications and to anticipate and successfully react to changes in food costs and product availability. Ingredients are purchased from suppliers on terms and conditions that management believes are generally consistent with those available to similarly situated restaurant companies. We rely on one or a limited number of suppliers for certain ingredients. This dependence on one or a limited number of suppliers, as well as the limited number of alternative suppliers of beef and quality seafood, subjects us to the possible risks of shortages, interruptions and price fluctuations in beef and seafood. Although alternative distribution sources are believed to be available for most products, increases in overall food prices, failure to perform by suppliers or distributors or limited availability of products at reasonable prices could cause our food costs to fluctuate and/or cause us to make adjustments to our menu offerings.\nBeef costs have historically represented approximately 30% of our food and beverage costs. We currently do not purchase beef pursuant to any long-term contractual arrangements with fixed pricing or use futures contracts or other financial risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to potential price fluctuations. The beef market is particularly volatile and is subject to extreme price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts, climate conditions, the price of feed, industry demand, energy demand and other factors. In addition, our dependence on frequent deliveries of fresh seafood subjects us to the risk of possible shortages or interruptions in supply caused by adverse weather, environmental factors or other conditions that could adversely affect the availability and cost of such items. In addition, some types of seafood have been subject to adverse publicity due to certain levels of contamination at their source or a perceived scarcity in supply, which can adversely affect both supply and market demand. We can make no assurances that in the future either seafood contamination or inadequate supplies of seafood might not have a significant and materially adverse effect on our operating results. Finally, the prices of other commodities can affect our costs as well, including corn and other grains, which are ingredients we use regularly and are also used as cattle feed and, therefore, affect the price of beef. Additional factors beyond our control, including adverse weather and market conditions, disease and governmental food safety regulation and enforcement, may also affect food costs and product availability. Energy prices can also affect our bottom line, as increased energy prices may cause increased transportation costs for beef and other supplies, as well as increased costs for the utilities required to run each restaurant. Historically, we have passed increased commodity and other costs on to our guests by increasing the prices of our menu items. There can be no assurance that additional price increases would not affect future guest traffic. Although we believe that our integrated cost systems allow us to anticipate and quickly respond to fluctuations in commodity prices, including beef prices, if prices increase in the future and we are unable to anticipate or react to these increases, or if there are beef shortages, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA failure to recruit, develop and retain effective leaders, or the loss or shortage of personnel with key capacities and skills, could jeopardize our ability to meet growth targets.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including restaurant managers, kitchen staff, hosts and servers necessary to meet the needs of our existing restaurants and anticipated expansion schedule, and who can meet the high standards necessary to deliver the levels of food quality, service and professionalism on which our concepts are based. Qualified individuals of the caliber and number needed to fill these positions are in short supply in\nsome communities and competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages and provide greater benefits to attract a sufficient number of skilled employees. Any inability to recruit and retain qualified individuals may also delay the planned openings of new restaurants and could adversely impact our existing restaurants. Any such inability to retain or recruit qualified employees, increased costs of attracting qualified employees or delays in restaurant openings could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, increases in employee turnover could have an adverse effect on food quality and guest service resulting in an adverse effect on net sales and results of operations.\nWe depend on the services of key executives and management-level employees, and our business and growth strategy could be materially harmed if we were to lose these individuals and were unable to replace them with executives of equal experience and capabilities.\nOur success is materially dependent upon the contributions of our senior executives and management-level employees because their experience in the restaurant industry and tenure with us allow for their invaluable contributions in setting our strategic direction, day-to-day operations, and recruiting and training key personnel. The loss of the services of such key employees could adversely affect our business until a suitable replacement of equal experience and capabilities could be identified. We believe that they could not quickly be replaced with executives of equal experience and capabilities and their successors may not be as effective. See \u201cInformation about our Executive Officers.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Reputation\nAny inability to actively and effectively utilize and manage social media could harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nSocial media provides a powerful medium for consumers, employees and others to communicate their approval of or displeasure with a business. Social media is especially challenging because it allows any individual to reach a broad audience with an ability to respond or react, in near real time, with comments that are often not filtered or checked for accuracy. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond, any negative publicity could \u201cgo viral\u201d causing nearly immediate and potentially significant harm to our reputation, whether or not factually accurate. Our marketing strategy also includes an emphasis on social media. As social media continues to grow in popularity, many of our competitors have expanded and improved their use of social media, making it more difficult for us to differentiate our social media messaging. As a result, we need to continuously innovate and develop our social media strategies and content. If we do not appropriately use and manage our social media strategies, our marketing efforts in this area may not be successful, and any failure to effectively respond to negative or potentially damaging social media, whether accurate or not, could damage our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nNegative customer experiences or negative publicity surrounding our restaurants or other restaurants could adversely affect sales in one or more of our restaurants and make our concepts less valuable.\nBecause we believe that our success depends significantly on our ability to provide exceptional food quality, outstanding service and an excellent overall dining experience, adverse publicity, whether or not accurate, relating to guest experience, food quality, public health concerns, illness, safety, injury or government or industry findings concerning our restaurants, restaurants operated by other foodservice providers or others across the food industry supply chain could affect us more than it would other restaurants that compete primarily on price or other factors. If customers perceive or experience a reduction in our food quality, service or ambiance or in any way believe we have failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, the value and popularity of one or more of our concepts could suffer. Further, because we rely heavily on \u201cword-of-mouth,\u201d as opposed to more conventional methods of advertisement, to establish and maintain restaurant recognition, our business may be more adversely affected by negative customer experiences than other upscale dining establishments, including those of our competitors.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulation, Litigation and Insurance\nGovernmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new restaurants or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local regulations, including those relating to building and zoning requirements and those relating to the preparation and sale of food. We are also subject to regulations, health guidelines and safety protocols related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as governmental restrictions related to capacity of our restaurants. The development and operation of restaurants depends to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations and requirements. Our restaurants are also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, alcoholic beverage, sanitation, food and occupational safety and other agencies. In addition, stringent and varied\nrequirements of local regulators with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations or cause increases in development costs. We are also subject to laws and regulations concerning waste disposal, pollution, protection of the environment, and the presence, discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous or toxic substances. These environmental laws provide for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance and liabilities for remediation, sometimes without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of hazardous toxic substances. Further, environmental laws, and the administration, interpretation and enforcement thereof, are subject to change and may become more stringent in the future, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the ADA and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas, including our restaurants. We may in the future have to modify restaurants by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures, for example, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons. The expenses associated with these modifications could be material.\nOur operations are also subject to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act, which governs worker health and safety, the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages and overtime, and a variety of similar federal, state and local laws that govern these and other employment law matters. We may also be subject to lawsuits from our employees, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or others alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, and we have been party to such matters in the past. Compliance with these laws can be costly and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation. In addition, federal, state and local proposals related to paid sick leave or similar matters could, if implemented, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and, therefore, have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with the aforementioned laws and regulations can be costly, and failure to comply can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.\nChanges to minimum wage laws and potential labor shortages could increase our labor costs substantially, which could slow our growth and adversely impact our ability to operate our restaurants.\nUnder the minimum wage laws in most jurisdictions, we are permitted to pay certain hourly employees a wage that is less than the base minimum wage for general employees because these employees receive tips as a substantial part of their income. A considerable portion of our employees earn this lower minimum wage. If cities, states or the federal government change their laws to require all employees to be paid the general employee minimum base wage regardless of supplemental tip income, our labor costs would increase substantially. Any increases in federal or state minimum wages or tipped minimum wages may cause us to increase the wages paid to our employees who already earn above-minimum wages in order to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. We may be unable or unwilling to increase our prices in order to pass these increased labor costs on to our guests, in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRestaurant companies, including ours, have been the target of claims and lawsuits. Claims or proceedings, if successful, could result in our payment of substantial costs and damages.\nIn recent years, we and other restaurant companies have been subject to claims and lawsuits alleging various matters including personal injury claims, contract claims, regulatory claims, and tax matters. Claims and lawsuits may include class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, wage and hour laws, discrimination and similar matters. Guests may file complaints alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury received while dining at one of our locations. Additionally, restaurants are subject to state \u201cdram-shop\u201d or similar laws which govern claims by injured parties resulting from legally intoxicated persons who may have been served alcoholic beverages at our locations. Public companies have also been the subject of shareholder claims with respect to various matters. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from our operations. In addition, they may generate negative publicity, which could reduce guest traffic and sales. Insurance may not be available at all or in sufficient amounts to cover any liabilities with respect to these or other matters. Accordingly, if we are required to pay substantial damages and expenses as a result of these types or other lawsuits, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected. Defense costs, even for unfounded claims, or a judgment or other liability in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims or any negative publicity resulting from claims could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur insurance policies may not provide adequate levels of coverage against all claims, and fluctuating insurance requirements and costs could negatively impact our profitability.\nWe currently maintain insurance coverage that we believe is reasonable for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not commercially reasonable to insure. These losses, if they occur, could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Additionally, health insurance costs in general have risen significantly across the country over the past few years and are expected to continue to increase. Obtaining insurance coverage responsive to these increases could have a negative impact on our profitability, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully offset the effect of such increases with plan modifications and cost control measures, additional operating efficiencies or the pass-through of such increased costs to our guests or employees.\nRisks Related to Technology, Data Privacy, and Intellectual Property\nFailure to enforce and maintain our intellectual property rights could enable others to use names confusingly similar to the names and marks used by our restaurants, which could adversely affect the value of our concepts.\nWe have registered the names J. Alexander\u2019s Restaurant, Redlands Grill, Merus Grill, Overland Park Grill, Stoney River Steakhouse and Grill, Seahorse, Birmingham Grill and certain other names and logos used by our restaurants as trade names, trademarks or service marks with the PTO. The success of our business depends in part on our continued ability to utilize our existing trade names, trademarks and service marks as currently used in order to increase our restaurant concept awareness. In that regard, we believe that our trade names, trademarks and service marks are valuable assets that are critical to our success. The unauthorized use or other misappropriation of our trade names, trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our restaurant concepts and may cause a decline in our net sales and force us to incur costs related to enforcing our rights. In addition, the use of trade names, trademarks or service marks similar to ours in some markets may keep us from entering those markets. While we may take protective actions with respect to our intellectual property, these actions may not be sufficient to prevent, and we may not be aware of all incidents of, unauthorized usage or imitation by others. Any such unauthorized usage or imitation of our intellectual property, including the costs related to enforcing our rights, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nInformation technology system failures, including when transitioning to new systems, or breaches of our network security, including with respect to confidential information, could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on our computer systems and network infrastructure across our operations, including point-of-sale processing at our restaurants and integrated cost systems that are instrumental in our procurement processes and in managing our food costs. The secure and efficient function of our systems, including our human resources management and restaurant back-office systems, is essential to our operations and financial results, including the integrity of our financial reporting. Our operations depend upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and systems against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, viruses, worms, implementation delays or failures and other disruptive problems. Any damage or failure of our computer systems or network infrastructure that causes an interruption in our operations could limit our ability to anticipate and react quickly to changes in our business environment and could subject us to litigation or actions by regulatory authorities. Unsuccessful or error-ridden implementation of upgrades could interrupt our business, distract our management, adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services and interfere with the operation of our restaurants, damaging our reputation and harming our financial results. In addition, the majority of our restaurant sales are by credit or debit cards. Other restaurants and retailers have experienced security breaches in which credit and debit card information of their guests has been stolen or compromised. If this or another type of breach occurs at one of our restaurants, we may become subject to lawsuits or other proceedings for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of our guests\u2019 credit or debit card information and be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures, investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities, or respond to any changes to state or federal regulations, policy statements or laws concerning information systems or security. Although we have made significant efforts to secure our computer network and to update and maintain our systems and procedures to meet the payment card industry data security standards, including the implementation of point-to-point encryption and Europay, Mastercard, Visa credit card security systems, our computer network could nevertheless be compromised and confidential information, such as guest credit card information, could be misappropriated. Any failure to maintain adequate security over our information systems, our technology-driven products and services or our guests\u2019 personal and transactional information could negatively affect our business and our reputation and result in fines, penalties, or other costs, including litigation expense and/or additional compliance costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber-attack on our systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage our reputation with guests and third parties with whom we do business. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us negative consequences, including loss of guests and business opportunities, disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation or destruction of our confidential information and/or that of our guests, or damage to our computers or systems, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy\nlaws or industry standards, including those that apply to payment card data, and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs, and could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial performance. Although we maintain a cyber-risk insurance policy, available coverage and policy limits may not adequately cover or compensate us in the event of losses or liability to third parties that may result from a security incident.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur level of indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur may limit our operational and financing flexibility and negatively impact our business.\nAs of January 3, 2021, our outstanding indebtedness totaled $14,750, and $25,000 was available for borrowing under our lines of credit. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Our credit facility, and other debt instruments we may enter into in the future, may significantly impact our business, including the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired;\n\u2022\nwe are required to use a significant portion of our cash flows from operations to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, which will reduce the funds available to us for operations and other purposes;\n\u2022\nour level of indebtedness could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt;\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited; and\n\u2022\nour level of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business.\nWe expect that we will depend primarily on cash generated by our operations for funds to pay our expenses and any amounts due under our credit facility and any other indebtedness we may incur. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which we cannot control, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future and our currently anticipated growth in net sales and cash flows may not be realized, either or both of which could result in our being unable to repay indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. If we do not generate adequate resources, we may be required to refinance all or part of our then existing debt, sell assets or borrow more money, in each case on terms that may not be acceptable to us. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements, including our existing credit facility, may restrict us from adopting some or any of these alternatives. Our inability to recapitalize and incur additional debt in the future could also delay or prevent a change in control of our Company, make some transactions more difficult and impose additional financial or other covenants on us. In addition, any significant levels of indebtedness in the future could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business. Our current indebtedness and any inability to pay our debt obligations as they come due or an inability to incur additional debt could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe terms of our credit facility impose operating and financial restrictions on us.\nOur credit facility contains certain restrictions and covenants that generally limit our ability to, among other things, pay dividends or make other restricted payments to our equity holders; incur additional indebtedness; use assets as security in other transactions; sell assets or merge with or into other companies; and sell equity or other ownership interests in our subsidiaries. Our credit facility may limit our ability to engage in these types of transactions even if we believed that a specific transaction would contribute to our future growth or improve our operating results. Our credit facility also requires us to achieve specified financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios, including as a condition to accessing additional amounts available for borrowing. As of January 3, 2021, we were in compliance with each of these financial covenants. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. A breach of any of these financial covenants or our inability to comply with required financial ratios in our credit facility could result in a default under the credit facility in which case the lenders would have the right to declare all borrowings, which includes any principal amount outstanding, together with all accrued, unpaid interest and other amounts owing in respect thereof, to be immediately due and payable. If we are unable to repay all borrowings when due, whether at maturity or if declared due and payable following a default, the lenders would have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to secure the indebtedness. If we breach these covenants or fail to comply with the terms of the credit facility and the lenders accelerate the amounts outstanding under the credit facility our business and results of operations would be adversely affected. Additionally, we may need to refinance our credit facility at maturity or upon default, and future financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nOur credit facility carries floating interest rates, thereby exposing us to market risk related to changes in interest rates. Accordingly, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. Assuming a 100 basis point increase on our base interest rate on our credit facility and a full drawdown on both of the Revolving Line of Credit and Development Line of Credit, our interest expense would increase by approximately $398 over the course of 12 months.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock and Our Organizational Structure\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and shareholders may not be able to sell shares at an acceptable price.\nThe market price of our stock could fluctuate significantly, and shareholders may not be able to resell shares at an acceptable price. Those fluctuations could be based on various factors in addition to those otherwise described in this Annual Report, including the following:\n\u2022\nour operating performance and the performance of our competitors or restaurant companies in general and fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nchanges to our earnings estimates;\n\u2022\nglobal, national or local economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new locations or menu items, capacity changes, strategic investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our or our competitors\u2019 operating results, and our or our competitors\u2019 growth rates;\n\u2022\nfailure by us or our competitors to meet guidance that we or our competitors may give the market;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations, or new interpretations or applications of laws and regulations, that are applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nthe arrival or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe number of shares being publicly traded;\n\u2022\nfuture sales or issuances of our common stock, including sales or issuances by us, our officers or directors and our significant shareholders; and\n\u2022\nother developments affecting us, our industry or our competitors.\nIn addition, in recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and restaurant industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions or interest rate changes, may cause declines in the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline due to significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to seasonality and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, resulting in a decline in our stock price. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of many factors, including the timing of new restaurant openings, labor costs, changing interest rates, changes in sales levels, macroeconomic conditions, public health concerns and fluctuation in commodity prices, among others. Seasonal factors and the timing of holidays may also cause our net sales to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. As a result of these factors, our quarterly and annual operating results and same store sales may fluctuate significantly. Accordingly, results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year. In the future, operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the price of our common stock may decrease.\nThe exchange of Class B Units for common stock may dilute our shareholders\u2019 ownership and the market price of our common stock could decline due to the number of shares of common stock eligible for future sale upon the exchange of Class B Units.\nThe Class B Units of J. Alexander\u2019s Holdings, LLC held by members of our management are exchangeable for, at our option, either shares of our common stock or a cash payment from J. Alexander\u2019s Holdings, LLC. If we elect to issue common stock in respect of these exchanges, investor ownership of common stock will be diluted. If we elect to have J. Alexander\u2019s Holdings, LLC make cash payments in lieu of issuing shares of common stock upon exchanges of Class B Units made by members of our management, such payments may require the payment of significant amounts of cash and may reduce the amount of overall cash flow that would otherwise be available for use in our business. In such event, our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy may be\nnegatively affected. Additionally, the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of issuances of additional shares of our common stock eligible for future sale upon the exchange of Class B Units, or the perception that such issuances could occur. These issuances, or the possibility that these issuances may occur, may also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling equity securities in the future, at a time and price that we deem appropriate. Approximately 5.3% of the ownership interests in J. Alexander\u2019s Holdings, LLC are Class B Units held by certain members of our management. We will not know the exact number of shares of common stock issuable until an exchange right is exercised by a holder of Class B Units.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are considered a smaller reporting company and have elected to take advantage of certain scaled disclosures in this Annual Report, and intend to continue to provide scaled disclosures in the future unless and until we no longer meet the definition of a smaller reporting company. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of some of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our choices, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe do not pay dividends at present.\nWe may retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment and currently do not pay a dividend. Any future determination to declare and pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend on, among other things, our financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and such other factors as our Board deems relevant. In addition, our current credit facility limits our ability to pay dividends. Our ability to pay dividends may also be limited by covenants of any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. As a result, investors may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless investors sell our common stock for a price greater than that which they paid for it.\nOur charter and bylaws and provisions of Tennessee law may discourage or prevent strategic transactions, including a takeover of our company, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our shareholders.\nProvisions contained in our charter and bylaws and provisions of the Tennessee Business Corporation Act could delay or prevent a third party from entering into a strategic transaction with us, as applicable, even if such a transaction would benefit our shareholders. For example, our charter and bylaws:\n\u2022\ndivide our board of directors into three classes with staggered three-year terms, which may delay or prevent a change of our management or a change in control;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by us upon approval of our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares of capital stock, making a takeover more difficult and expensive;\n\u2022\ndo not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which could otherwise make it easier for a smaller minority of shareholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\ndo not permit shareholders to take action upon less than unanimous written consent;\n\u2022\nprovide that special meetings of the shareholders may be called only by or at the direction of the board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors or the chief executive officer;\n\u2022\nrequire advance notice to be given by shareholders for any shareholder proposals or director nominees;\n\u2022\nrequire a super-majority vote of the shareholders to amend certain provisions of our charter; and\n\u2022\nallow our board of directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws but only allow shareholders to amend or repeal our bylaws upon the approval of 66 2/3 % or more of the voting power of all of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote.\nIn addition, we are subject to certain provisions of Tennessee law that limit, in some cases, our ability to engage in certain business combinations with significant shareholders. These restrictions and provisions could keep us from pursuing relationships with strategic partners and from raising additional capital, which could impede our ability to expand our business and strengthen our competitive position. These restrictions could also limit shareholder value by impeding a sale of us or J. Alexander\u2019s Holdings, LLC.\nRisks Related to Our Review of Strategic Alternatives\nWe have announced that we are exploring strategic alternatives, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or consummating any strategic alternatives, that strategic alternatives will yield additional value for shareholders, or that exploration of strategic alternatives will not adversely impact the Company.\nOn August 9, 2019, we announced that our Board had expanded its ongoing process to review strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value and retained Piper Jaffray & Co. (known as Piper Sandler & Company and referred to herein as \u201cPiper\u201d) as financial advisor to assist in the process, with a particular focus on a sale of the entire Company. The Board believed, and took into account the views of shareholders, that the small size of the Company made it inefficient to be a standalone publicly traded company. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in the identification or consummation of any transaction or any other particular outcome. Speculation regarding any developments related to the review of strategic alternatives and perceived uncertainties related to the future of the Company could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly.\nThere can be no assurance that expanding our review of strategic alternatives will not cause the diversion of management\u2019s attention, incurrence of significant transaction expenses, failure to retain or attract key personnel, vendors or guests, or exposure to potential litigation. If we are unable to mitigate these or other potential risks related to the uncertainty caused by our exploration of strategic alternatives, it may disrupt our business or could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThere can be no assurance that any potential transaction or other strategic alternative, if identified, evaluated and consummated, will provide greater value to our shareholders than that reflected in the current stock price. Further, our Board of Directors may determine to suspend or terminate the exploration of strategic alternatives at any time due to various factors. Any potential transaction or other outcome of this process is also dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including among other factors, market conditions, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, industry trends, availability of credit, regulatory limitations and the interest of third parties in our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our Board\u2019s review of strategic alternatives and there can be no assurance when or if a transaction will occur.\nIn 2019 and 2020, Piper ultimately contacted over 125 potential interested parties and through an exhaustive process, three interested parties emerged as serious potential acquirers. In 2020, one of those parties was in advanced negotiations with the Company for an acquisition at a premium to the then current market price. The initial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic led the potential acquirer to reduce its proposed purchase price twice and to insist on conditions relating to the performance of the Company. Ultimately, when government entities mandated the closure of the Company\u2019s restaurants, except for limited carry-out, the Board determined that no transaction at a price that reflected the long-term value of the Company would be able to be consummated until uncertainties surrounding the pandemic were resolved and the Company\u2019s business returned to satisfactory levels. The Company announced that, for the near term, the Company intended to focus on rebuilding its net sales base as its restaurants are able to increase capacity by providing an outstanding dining experience for its guests. The Board has disclosed its expectation that it will be sometime in 2021 before the Company can conclude its evaluation of strategic alternatives focusing on the potential sale of the Company. The timing of any conclusion or any transaction is uncertain and there can be no assurance that a transaction will occur.", "PERMNO": 66747, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "JAX"}
