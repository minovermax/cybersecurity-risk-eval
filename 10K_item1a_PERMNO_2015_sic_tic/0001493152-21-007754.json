RISK FACTORS\nOur business, including our operating results and financial condition, are subject to a wide variety of risks, including risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial but that could materially and adversely affect our business. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in our filings with the SEC, including our financial statements and related notes. Actual dollar amounts are used in this section.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has materially and adversely impacted the global and US economies. The economic headwinds posed by this have impacted our industry and our business and depending upon its duration and severity will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our industry and our business in significant ways, creating new risks and heightening existing risks. The environment within which we operate is, has been, and continues to be under ongoing stress, presenting risks and vulnerabilities that have previously not affected our performance. The level of uncertainty about the extent, duration and ultimate impact of the forces that are currently unsettling our markets has never been greater and will impact how supply, demand and price of crude oil will unfold in the months ahead. Direct management and operational risks exist now and are likely to continue and increase in the future relating to our ability to effectively sustain operational readiness. Maintaining the health of our key employees to operate our vessels and executives to manage the business during this turbulent time is critical. Our ability to adapt and implement policies and procedures in this regard, and to anticipate associated costs, are subject to developing consensus with relevant constituencies, including regulatory authorities, health officials, unions, customers, and those in our industry and supply chain, to achieve consistency and a common approach to coping with the very real and very difficult problems presented by COVID-19.\nWe have experienced, and there are heightened risks that we will continue to experience for the foreseeable future relating to: (i) drastic decreases in demand; (ii) uncertainties in the oil trading markets, with volatile and unpredictable oil pricing; (iii) heightened risk of off-hire periods resulting from managing virus-related delays; (iv) incurring costs for testing, cleaning, quarantine, immunization and certifications; (v) ability to comply with what are evolving, and sometimes conflicting, logistical health and safety protocols. (vi) difficulty in easily accessing critical supplies such as face masks and other personal protective equipment; (vii) risks related to the reliability and effectiveness of testing methodologies and PPE; (viii) delays in receiving critical supplies, in receiving services of specialized technicians and inspectors, and in concluding vetting of the vessels; (ix) restrictions on travel to or from countries in which OSG operates, or the inability to access certain areas; (x) reduced availability of airlines and other transportation modes to move our crews into position and increased costs associated with such travel; (xi) challenges getting crew to and from the vessels in a manner that both protects their personal safety and endeavors to assure that a joining crew member is not bringing COVID-19 onboard or is otherwise affecting a vessel\u2019s acceptability in service; (xii) increased costs to develop, implement and enforce policies and procedures to deal with all of these challenges; and (xiii) restricted port policies for pilots, tugs and inspections.\nFurther risks relate to potential longer-term impacts of the pandemic on our Jones Act trade. The models we typically use to forecast demand may not be reliable in the wake of this health emergency. A V-shaped recovery is not expected in transportation fuel demand, with uneven recovery predicted in various fuel sectors. The shape and speed of fuel demand recovery could have significant negative impacts on our key customers, refineries in particular, which would likely have a material impact on both domestic tank vessel demand as well as on OSG\u2019s expected forward revenue streams.\nAs of March 1, 2021, we have seven vessels in layup due to the lack of demand. While laying up a vessel mitigates our risks and lowers our cost, there are costs involved and no offsetting revenue. For those vessels in service, we are experiencing reduced cargo volumes and increased idle times, derivatives of falling refinery runs and unprecedented demand destruction for transportation fuels arising out of stay-at-home policies in many populated regions.\nVolatility in rates is expected to continue. The overall level of crude oil production cuts in the U.S. over the coming months and the impact of these cuts on the relative price differentials between domestic and comparable international crude oil are significant factors for the U.S. trades. Even if energy prices rise, the fact that crude oil production has declined, coupled with the increase of tonnage released back into the market once product stored is delivered for consumption, will likely impact negatively on future rates. We have heightened exposure to risks to those of our vessels operating on the spot market, as rate and utilization assumptions for those vessels must cover a wide range of possible scenarios.\n15 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nThe Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness and could breach covenants in its credit facilities and term loans.\nThe Company\u2019s earnings, cash flow and the market value of its vessels vary significantly due to direct impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, general economic, competitive and market conditions affecting the industry, and the cyclical nature of the tanker industry, with many of these factors beyond the control of the Company. The amount of debt that OSG can manage in some periods may not be appropriate for other periods and OSG\u2019s ability to meet the financial covenants to which it is subject or may be subject in the future may be at risk. Any insufficiency could negatively impact OSG\u2019s business.\nThe term loan, due 2023, contains certain restrictions relating to new borrowings, the movement of funds between OBS and OSG, and financial covenants. Other financings to which OSG is a party contain similar restrictions and financial covenants. Insufficiencies in earnings, cash flow and market value of the vessels could require the Company to make mandatory payments or cause the Company to breach certain covenants. If the Company is unable to remedy the relevant breach or obtain a waiver, the Company\u2019s lenders could accelerate its debts and foreclose on the Company\u2019s owned vessels.\nIf OSG does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy its debt obligations, it may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as selling tankers or other assets, reducing or delaying investments and capital expenditures, refinancing or restructuring its debt, and/or seeking to raise additional capital. The Company\u2019s ability to restructure or refinance its debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets, its access to such markets and its financial condition at that time. Any future refinancing of debt could be at higher interest rates and might require the Company to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict OSG\u2019s business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict OSG from adopting certain alternatives. These potential undertakings and alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit OSG to meet its scheduled debt service obligations.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, to meet its financial covenants and/or to obtain alternative financing in such circumstances, could materially and adversely affect OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOSG has incurred significant indebtedness, which could affect our ability to finance operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run the business in the future, all of which could affect OSG\u2019s ability to fulfill its obligations under that indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2020, OSG had $429.1 million of outstanding indebtedness. This substantial indebtedness and interest expense could have important consequences, including (i) limiting OSG\u2019s ability to use cash flow from operations in other areas of its business, such as for working capital, because a substantial portion of these funds are dedicated to service its debt; (ii) requiring the Company to seek to incur additional indebtedness in order to make planned capital expenditures and other expenses or investments; (iii) limiting OSG\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and other expenses or investments planned by the Company; (iv) limiting the Company\u2019s flexibility and ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in government regulation, and OSG\u2019s business and industry; (v) limiting OSG\u2019s ability to satisfy its obligations under its indebtedness or to refinance its indebtedness; (vi) increasing OSG\u2019s vulnerability to a downturn and to adverse economic and industry conditions generally; and (vii) limiting the Company\u2019s ability to enter into hedging transactions by reducing the number of counterparties with whom OSG can enter into such transactions as well as the volume of those transactions.\nOSG\u2019s ability to continue to fund its obligations and to reduce debt may be affected by general economic, financial market, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things. An inability to fund the Company\u2019s debt requirements or reduce debt could have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n16 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nThe Company\u2019s significant operating leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced, and a portion of the vessels leased are in layup.\nThe Company\u2019s fleet includes ten vessels that have been chartered-in under operating leases. Four of the ten vessels are currently in layup. These leases expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced at all or on as favorable terms. The bareboat charter hire continues to be due and paid even if the vessel is in lay-up, with no corresponding revenue. These circumstances could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s future financial position, results of operations and cash flow.\nChanges in demand in specialized markets in which the Company currently operates or changes in governmental support may lead the Company to redeploy certain vessels to other markets or put its ability to participate in specialized markets at risk.\nThe Company conducts lightering operations in the Delaware Bay with one ATB built for these operations. If there is lower demand for this vessel in the Delaware Bay lightering market, the Company might have to redeploy this ATB in other markets in which it may not be able to compete profitably and/or may require substantial modification. In addition, the Company would be required to pay daily liquidated damages to MarAd if this vessel was deployed in the contiguous coastwise trades.\nThe Company has two vessels participating in the MSP which derive a substantial percentage of revenues earned from transporting cargoes reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under MarAd\u2019s cargo preference program, which is set up to be compliant with certain laws and regulations that require shippers to give U.S.-flag vessels a preference to transport any government-impelled ocean borne cargoes. Among the currently available government-impelled cargoes is a contract the Company has with the Government of Israel (\u201cGOI\u201d) to deliver fuel through December 31, 2021, which the GOI funds with grants from the U.S. government. The Company also seeks other government-impelled cargoes to supplement the GOI business; however, there is no assurance the Company will be able to secure such cargoes. If the OSG is unable to retain the GOI business or is unable to obtain significant other charters for these vessels, the Company may no longer be able to participate in the MSP.\nThe Company operates three Jones Act MR Shuttle Tankers, two of which are currently operating as shuttle tankers serving offshore oil installations in the Gulf of Mexico. Modifications made to enable these tankers to perform the specialized service of a shuttle tanker required the Company to incur substantial capital costs, which in turn allow the Company to earn a premium to market rates earned by conventional Jones Act tankers. The customers with wells and fields in the Gulf of Mexico have high cash production costs and, as such, are vulnerable to production cuts or shut down in response to persistently low oil prices. While shuttle tankers can serve as conventional tankers without further modification, future reduction in the demand for specialized shuttle tanker services could limit the Company\u2019s ability to earn such premiums.\nIf OSG is no longer able to participate in any of these niche businesses, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nOSG may not be able to renew Time Charters when they expire or enter into new Time Charters and vessels may be placed in layup.\nOSG\u2019s ability to renew expiring contracts or obtain new charters will depend on the prevailing market conditions at the time of renewal. Renewals or new contracts may be at less favorable rates. There may be a gap in employment between charters or the vessel may only be able to be employed on the spot market, both of which would affect utilization rates and result in increased costs to the Company. If there is no demand for a vessel, there is also a risk of the necessity to layup the vessel. These occurrences would adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nConstraints on capital availability have adversely affected the tanker industry and OSG\u2019s business.\nConstraints on capital may adversely affect the financial condition of the Company\u2019s customers, lenders, suppliers, and others. While OSG seeks to monitor the financial condition of its customers, lenders and suppliers, the availability and accuracy of information about them and the actions that OSG may take to reduce possible losses resulting from the failure of such entities to comply with their contractual obligations may be limited. In addition, adverse financial conditions may inhibit these entities from entering into new commitments with OSG. These factors could have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s revenues, profitability and cash flows, as well as its borrowing ability and financial condition.\n17 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nThe Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a limited number of customers, and the loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers, should they be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s largest customers account for a significant portion of its revenues. The Company\u2019s top three customers comprised approximately 34.1% of the Company\u2019s revenues during 2020. The loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperating costs and capital expenses will increase as the Company\u2019s vessels age and due to unexpected drydocks.\nIn general, capital expenditures, cargo insurance rates and other costs necessary for maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase as the age of the vessel increases. Changes in governmental regulations and compliance with Classification Society standards may restrict the type of activities in which the vessels may engage and/or may require OSG to make additional expenditures for new equipment. Vessels must be drydocked periodically for inspection and maintenance, and in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty but can be substantial, and the Company\u2019s insurance may not cover these costs. Vessels in drydock will generally not generate any income. In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements.\nAs a result of these factors, OSG may be required to incur substantial costs or take its vessels out of service. Market conditions may not justify such expenditures or permit OSG to operate its vessels profitably even if those vessels remain operational. These cost increases, delays, expenses and off-hire time could have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts, and any failure by those counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings.\nThe Company has entered into, and in the future will enter into, various contracts associated with the operation of its vessels. The ability of each of the Company\u2019s counterparties to perform its obligations under a contract with it will depend on a number of factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions; availability of debt or equity financing; the condition of the maritime and offshore industries; the financial condition of the counterparty; charter rates received for specific types of vessels; and various expenses. Charterers are sensitive to the commodity markets and may be impacted by market forces affecting commodities such as oil. In addition, as we are currently experiencing, in depressed market conditions, the Company\u2019s charterers and customers may no longer need a vessel that had been under charter or contract or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at lower rates. As a result, the Company\u2019s customers may fail to pay charter hire or attempt to renegotiate charter rates. If the counterparties fail to meet their obligations, the Company could suffer losses on such contracts which would decrease revenues, cash flows and earnings.\nMaritime claimants could arrest OSG\u2019s vessels, which could interrupt cash flows.\nCrew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of the Company\u2019s vessels could interrupt OSG\u2019s cash flow and require it to pay a significant amount of money to have the arrest lifted. Claimants could try to assert \u201csister ship\u201d liability against one vessel in the Company\u2019s fleet for claims relating to another vessel in its fleet which, if successful, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n18 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nInterruption, failure or breach of OSG\u2019s information technology and communications systems could impair its ability to operate and adversely affect its business.\nOSG has both on-shore and ship-board systems that are highly dependent on information technology systems. Information technology and communication systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns, and security-threatening intrusions. OSG may experience failures caused by the occurrence of natural disasters, computer hacking or viruses or other unanticipated problems at OSG\u2019s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations. The Company collects, stores and transmits data using both internal information technology systems and those of third-party vendors. The secure storage, processing, maintenance, and transmission of sensitive data, including our own proprietary business information and that of our customers, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, is critical to the Company\u2019s operations. OSG\u2019s network, or those of our clients or third-party vendors, could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, or targeted attacks intended to steal or destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage.\nThe Company may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against these threats or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. Security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities and could also cause customers to lose confidence in our systems. Any failure of OSG\u2019s or third-party systems could result in interruptions in service, reductions in its revenue and profits, damage to our reputation and brand, or liability for the release of confidential information.\nDelays or disruptions in implementing new technological and management systems could impair the Company\u2019s ability to operate and adversely affect its business.\nThe Company is currently in the process of transitioning to a new software system for managing ship operations. From time to time the Company implements new systems or upgrades technological resources utilized in running its business. The transition to new technology requires a significant investment in capital and personnel resources and the coordination of numerous software and system providers and internal business teams. The Company may experience difficulties as it manages these changes and transitions to a new system and upgrades its technological resources, including loss or corruption of data, delays, decreases in productivity as personnel implement and become familiar with new systems and processes, and unanticipated expenses. Additionally, the Company could be adversely affected if the new software system it is implementing for managing ship operations or other new or upgraded technological resource are defective, not installed properly, fail to perform as marketed or are not properly integrated into existing operations. In addition, the implementation of a new system may not result in improvements that outweigh the cost of implementation. System implementation failures or operational failures, including unauthorized access by third parties to our new software system (which could have the effects described in the preceding risk factor) could have adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, and ability to operate in a complex industry.\nWe could face significant liability if one or more multiemployer plans in which we participate is reported to have underfunded liabilities and we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate.\nThe Company is a party to collective-bargaining agreements that require contributions to three jointly managed multiemployer pension plans covering seagoing personnel of U.S. Flag vessels. Our required contributions to these plans could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, the inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, low interest rates, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. Certain of these multiemployer plans are currently underfunded. Significantly underfunded pension plans are required to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their under-funding. As a result, OSG\u2019s required contributions to these plans may increase in the future. In addition, a termination of or voluntary withdrawal from or a mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan would require OSG to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of such multiemployer pension plan\u2019s unfunded vested liabilities. See Note 16, \u201cPension and Other Post Retirement Benefit Plans,\u201d to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 for additional information. Requirements to pay increased contributions or withdrawal liabilities could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations.\n19 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nVolatile changes in charter rates and vessel values could adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings, liquidity and available cash.\nThe marine transportation industry is both cyclical and volatile in terms of demand, charter rates and profitability. Fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values result from changes in supply and demand both for tanker capacity and for oil and oil products. Factors affecting these changes in supply and demand are generally outside of the Company\u2019s control. Aside from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, additional factors influencing the demand for tanker capacity include: (i) supply and demand for, and availability of energy resources such as oil, oil products and natural gas, which affect customers\u2019 need for vessel capacity; (ii) availability of refining capacity and inventories; (iii) changes in the production levels of crude oil; (iv) increases in the supply of Jones Act vessels without a commensurate increase in demand; (v) global and regional economic and political conditions, including armed conflicts, terrorist activities and strikes, and international sanctions, embargoes, import and export restrictions or nationalizations and wars that could impact the supply of oil ; (vi) changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns, including changes in the distances that cargoes are transported, changes in the price of crude oil and changes to the West Texas Intermediate and Brent Crude Oil pricing benchmarks; and (vii) competition from alternative sources of energy.\nMany of the factors that influence the demand for tanker capacity will also, in the longer term, effectively influence the supply of tanker capacity, since decisions to build new capacity, invest in capital repairs, or to retain in service older capacity are influenced by the general state of the marine transportation industry from time to time. Factors influencing the supply of vessel capacity include (i) the number of newbuild deliveries or the conversion of vessels into or out of transporting oil; (ii) the number of vessels removed from service, such as via recycling, scrapping or conversion to storage; and (iii) the availability and pricing of other energy sources such as natural gas for which tankers can be used or to which construction capacity may be dedicated.\nThe nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable and could adversely affect the values of the Company\u2019s vessels or result in significant fluctuations in the amount of charter revenues the Company earns, which could result in significant volatility in OSG\u2019s quarterly results and cash flows.\nThe market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect OSG\u2019s liquidity or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition.\nWhile Jones Act and U.S. Flag vessel market values have, on average, generally declined over the past several years, the market value of Jones Act vessels has fluctuated over time.\nThe fluctuating market values of the vessels can impact the Company\u2019s liquidity regardless of whether the Company sells or continues to hold the vessels. For example, selling a vessel at a sale price that is less than the vessel\u2019s carrying amount on the Company\u2019s financial statements will result in a loss on the sale and a reduction in earnings and surplus. Declining values of the Company\u2019s vessels could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity by limiting its ability to raise cash by refinancing vessels.\nThe Company may also experience significant impairment charges upon a decline in vessel value. Any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n20 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nChanges in fuel prices may adversely affect profits.\nFuel is a significant, if not the largest, expense in the Company\u2019s shipping operations when vessels are under voyage charter. Accordingly, an increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability if these increases cannot be passed onto customers. Moreover, higher fuel prices could reduce the profitability and competitiveness of the Company\u2019s business compared to other forms of transportation. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside the Company\u2019s control.\nOSG conducts certain of its operations internationally, which subjects the Company to changing economic, political and governmental conditions abroad that may adversely affect its business.\nThe Company conducts certain of its operations internationally, and its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where its vessels are employed. OSG must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as environmental regulations requiring investments and upgrades, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, anti-money laundering laws; and anti-competition regulations. OSG\u2019s operations may also subject its employees and agents to extortion attempts. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on the Company\u2019s business operations and on the Company\u2019s ability to transport cargo to one or more countries, and could also materially affect the Company\u2019s brand, ability to attract and retain employees, international operations, business and operating results. Although OSG has policies and procedures designed to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations, OSG cannot be certain that its employees, contractors, joint venture partners or agents will not violate these policies and procedures.\nShipping is a business with inherent risks, and OSG\u2019s insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses.\nOSG\u2019s vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost due to accidents, bad weather, mechanical failure, human error, and other factors. These hazards may result in death or injury; loss of revenues or property; environmental damage; higher insurance rates; damage to customer relationships and industry reputation; and market disruptions, and delay or rerouting, all of which may also subject OSG to litigation. The operation of tankers has unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil. An oil spill may cause significant environmental damage and the associated costs could exceed the insurance coverage available to the Company.\nWhile the Company carries insurance to protect against certain of these risks, risks may arise against which the Company is not adequately insured. In the past, new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution, and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable.\nTerrorism, piracy, or hostilities could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nAlthough the Company\u2019s fleet operates mainly in U.S. waters, there are occasions when a vessel may be in an area where terrorist or pirate attacks, or hijacking are a concern. If attacks result in regions in which the Company\u2019s vessels are deployed being characterized by insurers as \u201cwar risk\u201d zones or Joint War Committee \u201cwar and strikes\u201d listed areas, premiums payable for insurance coverage could increase significantly, and such insurance coverage may become difficult to obtain. Crew costs could also increase in such circumstances due to risks of piracy attacks. While OSG believes the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by pirates, disputes with the charterer may result in the delay or non-payment of charter hire, or cancellation of the charter party. The Company may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, or an increase in the cost (or unavailability) of insurance for those vessels could have a material adverse impact on OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such attacks may also impact the Company\u2019s customers, which could impair their ability to make payments to the Company under its charters.\nTerrorism or international hostilities could cause political instability, damage the world economy, adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect both the Company\u2019s ability to charter its vessels and the charter rates payable under any such charters. These factors could also increase the costs to the Company of conducting its business, particularly crew, insurance and security costs, and prevent or restrict the Company from obtaining insurance coverage, all of which could have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n21 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nThe Company\u2019s business would be adversely affected if it failed to comply with the Jones Act\u2019s limitations on U.S. coastwise trade, or if these limitations were waived, modified or repealed, or if changes in international trade agreements were to occur.\nThe Company is responsible for monitoring the foreign ownership of its common stock and other interests to ensure compliance with the Jones Act. The Company could lose the privilege of owning and operating vessels in the Jones Act trade if non-U.S. Citizens were to own or control, in the aggregate, more than 25% of the equity interests in the Company. Such loss would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. In addition, failure to comply with the Jones Act could result in the Company being deemed to have violated other U.S. federal laws that prohibit a foreign transfer of U.S. documented vessels without government approval, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading privileges or forfeiture of the vessels deemed transferred, and fines.\nMaritime transportation services are currently excluded from the General Agreement on Trade in Services (\u201cGATS\u201d) and are the subject of reservations by the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d) and other international free trade agreements. If maritime transportation services were included in GATS, NAFTA or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise repealed or altered, the transportation of maritime cargo between U.S. ports could be opened to international flag or foreign built vessels. Interest groups regularly lobby Congress, and legislation has been introduced, to repeal certain provisions of the Jones Act or to grant extensive waivers so as to facilitate international flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under the Jones Act. The Company expects that continued efforts will be made to modify, repeal, or waive the Jones Act. Because international vessels may have lower construction costs, wage rates and operating costs, this could significantly increase competition in the coastwise trade, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe U.S. government could requisition the Company\u2019s vessels during a period of war or emergency, which may negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash.\nThe U.S. government could requisition one or more of the Company\u2019s vessels for title or hire, typically occurring during a period of war or emergency. The U.S. government requisition of one or more of the Company\u2019s vessels could impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash if the charter rates we receive from the government while on requisition are less than the charter rates that are being replaced, or if the government refuses to pay the requisition charter rate, in which case we would seek recovery through our insurance policies.\nCompliance with complex laws and regulations, including those seeking to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus, and environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the emission of greenhouse gas gases and ballast water treatment, may adversely affect OSG\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject to the oversight of several government agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation. OPA 90 affects all vessel owners shipping oil or hazardous material to, from or within the United States. OPA 90 allows for potentially unlimited liability without regard to fault for owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels for oil pollution in U.S. waters. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters. OPA 90 expressly permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to hazardous materials and oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Coastal states in the United States have enacted pollution prevention liability and response laws, many providing for unlimited liability. The Company\u2019s operations are affected by these extensive and changing international, national and local environmental protection laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards designed to reduce the risk of oil spills and water pollution and to regulate air emissions, including emission of greenhouse gases. These requirements impose significant capital and operating costs on OSG.\nDue to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries, including the United States, and international organizations, including the IMO and the European Union, have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Such actions could result in significant financial and operational impacts on the Company\u2019s business, including requiring OSG to install new emission controls, or to acquire allowances or pay taxes related to its greenhouse gas emissions. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Environmental, Safety and Security Matters.\u201d.\nIn order to comply with laws and regulations, the Company incurs substantial capital and/or operating expenditures and develops contingency arrangements for potential spills. The Company is in the process of installing ballast water treatment systems on its vessels at substantial capital cost. Although the Company has performed due diligence in choosing the particular systems, there is no assurance that the technologies chosen will perform as expected or be installed without delays.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations can affect the resale value or significantly reduce the useful lives of the Company\u2019s vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions (and related increased operating costs) or retirement of service, lead to decreased availability or higher cost of insurance coverage for environmental matters or result in the denial of access to, or detention in, certain jurisdictional waters or ports. Under local, national and foreign laws, as well as international treaties and conventions, OSG could incur material liabilities, including cleanup obligations, natural resource damages, fines and penalties in the event that there is a release of oil, petroleum or other hazardous substances from its vessels or otherwise in connection with its operations. OSG could be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to the release of or exposure to hazardous materials associated with its current or historic operations. Violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements also can result in substantial penalties, fines and other sanctions, including in certain instances, seizure or detention of the Company\u2019s vessels.\n22 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nIt can be expected that these regulations will continue to become stricter in the future and will require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures to keep its vessels in compliance, or even to scrap or sell certain vessels altogether. Such expenditures could result in financial and operational impacts that may be material to OSG\u2019s financial statements. The failure to comply with local, domestic and foreign regulations may subject the Company to increased liability, may invalidate existing insurance or decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports.\nThe employment of the Company\u2019s vessels could be adversely affected by an inability to clear the oil majors\u2019 risk assessment process.\nThe major oil companies have developed a strict due diligence process for selecting their shipping partners out of concerns for the environmental impact of spills. This vetting process has evolved into a sophisticated and comprehensive risk assessment of both the vessel manager and the vessel. The Company\u2019s charterers require that the Company\u2019s vessels and the technical managers pass vetting inspections and management audits. The Company\u2019s failure to maintain any of its vessels to these standards could put the Company in breach of the applicable charter agreement and lead to termination of such agreement thereby adversely affecting the revenues of the Company.\nTransfers or issuances of the Company\u2019s equity may impair or reduce the Company\u2019s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes in the future.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. An \u201cownership change\u201d is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50% of a corporation\u2019s stock over a rolling three-year period by stockholders that own (directly or indirectly) 5% or more of the stock of a corporation or arising from a new issuance of stock by a corporation. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the use of pre-ownership change NOLs, credits and certain other tax attributes to offset taxable income earned after the ownership change. The annual limitation is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate and the value of the company\u2019s stock immediately before the ownership change. This annual limitation may be adjusted to reflect any unused annual limitation for prior years and certain recognized built-in gains and losses for the year. In addition, Section 383 generally limits the amount of tax liability in any post-ownership change year that can be reduced by pre-ownership change tax credit carryforwards. If the Company were to undergo an \u201cownership change,\u201d it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSome provisions of Delaware law and the Company\u2019s governing documents could influence its ability to effect a change of control.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law and contained in the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company. These provisions could make it more difficult to bring about a change in the composition of the Company\u2019s board of directors. For example, the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws (i) give the sole ability to then-current members of its board of directors to fill a vacancy on the board of directors; (ii) require the affirmative vote of two-thirds or more of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares of its capital stock in order to amend or repeal certain provisions of its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws; and (iii) establish advance notice requirements for nomination for elections to its board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. In addition, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation contains restrictions on foreign ownership of the Company\u2019s common stock. These restrictions could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company.\nSeparately, the Company has elected to opt out of Section 203 (\u201cSection 203\u201d) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), which restricts certain business combinations between a Delaware corporation and an \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d Accordingly, the Company will be able to enter into such transactions with its principal stockholders without complying with the requirements of Section 203. The election to opt out of Section 203 could deprive certain stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company, particularly if it enters into a transaction with an \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d\n23 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.", "PERMNO": 51457, "SIC": 4412, "TIC": "OSG"}
