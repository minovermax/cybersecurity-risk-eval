{"cik": "720154", "company": "BIOANALYTICAL SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-12-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business is subject to many risks and uncertainties, which may affect our future financial performance. If any of the events or circumstances described below occur, our business and financial performance could be adversely affected, our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline. The risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face. There may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nA reduction in research and development budgets at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may adversely affect our business.\nOur customers include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Our ability to continue to grow and win new business is dependent in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on research and development and to purchase the products and outsource the services we provide. Fluctuations in the research and development budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, spending priorities and institutional budgetary policies. Our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in life sciences research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Economic factors and industry trends that affect our customers in these industries also affect our business.\nWe rely on a limited number of key customers, the importance of which may vary dramatically from year to year, and a loss of one or more of these key customers may adversely affect our operating results.\nFive customers accounted for approximately 30% of our total revenue in fiscal 2015 and approximately 31.7% of our total revenues in fiscal 2014. The loss of a significant amount of business from one of our major customers would materially and adversely affect our results of operations until such time, if ever, as we are able to replace the lost business. Significant customers or projects in any one period may not continue to be significant customers or projects in other periods. In any given year, there is a possibility that a single pharmaceutical company may account for a significant percentage of our total revenue or that our business may be dependent on one or more large projects. Since we do not have long-term contracts with most of our customers, the importance of a single customer may vary dramatically from year to year as projects end and new projects begin. To the extent that we are dependent on any single customer, we are subject to the risks faced by that customer to the extent that such risks impede the customer's ability to stay in business and make timely payments to us.\nThe majority of our customers\u2019 contracts can be terminated upon short notice.\nMost of our contracts for CRO services are terminable by the customer upon 30 days\u2019 notice. Customers terminate or delay their contracts for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to:\n\u00b7 products being tested fail to satisfy safety requirements;\n\u00b7 products have undesired clinical results;\n\u00b7 the customer decides to forego a particular study;\n\u00b7 inability to enroll enough patients in the study;\n\u00b7 inability to recruit enough investigators;\n\u00b7 production problems causing shortages of the drug; and\n\u00b7 actions by regulatory authorities.\nThe loss, reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business, although our contracts frequently entitle us to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects, as well as all fees earned by us up to the time of termination. Some contracts also entitle us to a termination fee.\nChanges in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical industry could change the demand for the services we provide.\nGovernmental agencies throughout the world, but particularly in the United States, strictly regulate the drug development process. Our business involves helping pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies comply with the regulatory drug approval process. Changes in regulation, such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures, or an increase in regulatory requirements that we may have difficulty satisfying, or that make our services less competitive, could substantially change the demand for our services. Also, if the government increases efforts to contain drug costs and pharmaceutical and biotechnology company profits from new drugs, our customers may spend less, or reduce their growth in spending on research and development.\nWe may bear financial risk if we underprice our contracts or overrun cost estimates.\nSince some of our contracts are structured as fixed price or fee-for-service, we bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates. Such underpricing or significant cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nAny failure by us to comply with existing regulations could harm our reputation and operating results.\nAny failure on our part to comply with existing regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities. For example, if we were to fail to properly monitor compliance with study protocols, the data collected could be disqualified. If this were to happen, we may be contractually required to repeat a study at no further cost to the customer, but at substantial cost to us. This would harm our reputation, our prospects for future work and our operating results. Furthermore, the issuance of a notice from the FDA based on a finding of a material violation by us of good clinical practice, good laboratory practice or good manufacturing practice requirements could materially and adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nOur future success depends on our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes that could make our services and products less competitive or obsolete.\nThe biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device industries generally, and contract research services more specifically, are subject to increasingly rapid technological changes. Our competitors or others might develop technologies, services or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future technologies, services or products, or that render our technologies, services or products less competitive or obsolete. If competitors introduce superior technologies, services or products and we cannot make enhancements to ours to remain competitive, our competitive position, and in turn our business, revenues and financial condition, would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have experienced periods of losses on our operating activities.\nOur overall strategy includes increasing revenue on a consistent basis and controlling our operating expenses. We have concentrated our efforts on enhancing our business development program as well as ongoing Company-wide efficiency activities intended to increase productivity and streamline our operations. We cannot assure that our efforts will result in profitability, or if our efforts result in profits, such profits will continue for any meaningful period of time.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants contained in our credit facility, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nOn May 14, 2014, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Huntington Bank. The agreement includes both a term loan and a revolving loan and is secured by mortgages on our facilities in West Lafayette and Evansville, Indiana and liens on our personal property. This credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios. The credit facility also requires us to comply with various operational and other covenants. If there were an event of default under our credit facility that was not cured or waived, the lenders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately. We cannot assure that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under the credit facility, either upon maturity or if accelerated, upon an event of default, or that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments becoming due on the credit facility. Please see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail regarding our credit facility.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nMaintaining effective internal controls over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements. Moreover, we must maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures in order to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be reported in our periodic reports filed with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures or remediate any material weakness, it could result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements that would require a restatement or other materially deficient disclosures, investor confidence in the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reports and other disclosures may be adversely impacted, and the market price of our common shares could be negatively impacted.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe CRO services industry is highly competitive. We often compete for business not only with other, often larger and better capitalized, CRO companies, but also with internal discovery and development departments within our customers, some of which are large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with greater resources than we have. If we do not compete successfully, our business will suffer. The industry is highly fragmented, with numerous smaller specialized companies and a handful of full-service companies with global capabilities much larger than ours. Increased competition might lead to price and other forms of competition that might adversely affect our operating results. As a result of competitive pressures, our industry experienced consolidation in recent years. This trend is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies for both customers and acquisition candidates.\nThe loss of our key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel. The loss of the services of such personnel could adversely affect our business. Also, because of the nature of our business, our success is dependent upon our ability to attract, train, manage and retain technologically qualified personnel. There is substantial competition for qualified personnel, and an inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel may impact our ability to grow our business and compete effectively in our industry.\nWe might incur expense to develop products that are never successfully commercialized.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur research and development and other expenses in connection with our products business. The potential products to which we devote resources might never be successfully developed or commercialized by us for numerous reasons, including:\n\u00b7 inability to develop products that address our customers\u2019 needs;\n\u00b7 competitive products with superior performance;\n\u00b7 patent conflicts or unenforceable intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7 demand for the particular product; and\n\u00b7 other factors that could make the product uneconomical.\nIncurring expenses for a potential product that is not successfully developed and/or commercialized could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and stock price.\nProviding CRO services creates a risk of liability.\nWe could be held liable for errors and omissions in connection with the services we perform. In certain circumstances, we seek to manage our liability risk through contractual provisions with customers requiring us to be indemnified by the customers or covered by the customers\u2019 product liability insurance policies. Although many of our customers are large, well-capitalized companies, the financial performance of these indemnities is not secured. Therefore, we bear the risk that the indemnifying party may not have the financial ability to fulfill its indemnification obligations or the liability would exceed the amount of applicable insurance. There can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate, or that insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms, or that we can obtain indemnification arrangements or otherwise be able to limit our liability risk.\nWe rely on third parties for important services.\nWe depend on third parties to provide us with services critical to our business. The failure of any of these third parties to adequately provide the needed services including, without limitation, transportation services, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business uses biological and hazardous materials, which could injure people or violate laws, resulting in liability that could adversely impact our financial condition and business.\nOur activities involve the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials, as well as hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages that result, and any liability could exceed our insurance coverage and ability to pay. Any contamination or injury could also damage our reputation, which is critical to obtaining new business. In addition, we are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations is significant and if changes are made to impose additional requirements, these costs could increase and have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nHardware or software failures, delays in the operations of our computer and communications systems or the failure to implement system enhancements could harm our business.\nOur success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems. A failure of our network or data gathering procedures could impede the processing of data, delivery of databases and services, customer orders and day-to-day management of our business and could result in the corruption or loss of data. While we have disaster recovery plans in place for our operations, they might not adequately protect us. Despite any precautions we take, damage from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins and similar events at our computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to our servers and from our servers to our customers. In addition, any failure by our computer environment to provide our required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service. In the event of a delay in the delivery of data, we could be required to transfer our data collection operations to an alternative provider of server hosting services. Such a transfer could result in delays in our ability to deliver our products and services to our customers. Additionally, significant delays in the planned delivery of system enhancements, improvements and inadequate performance of the systems once they are completed could damage our reputation and harm our business. Finally, long-term disruptions in the infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters, the outbreak of war, the escalation of hostilities and acts of terrorism, particularly involving cities in which we have offices, could adversely affect our businesses. Although we carry property and business interruption insurance, our coverage might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur.\nOur animal populations may suffer diseases that can damage our inventory, harm our reputation, result in decreased sales of our services or research products or result in other liability to us.\nIt is important that our animal populations be free of diseases, including infectious diseases. The presence of diseases can distort or compromise the quality of research results, can cause loss of animals in our inventory, can result in harm to humans or outside animal populations if the disease is not contained to animals in inventory, or can result in other losses. Such results could harm our reputation or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur products business depends on our intellectual property.\nOur products business is dependent, in part, on our ability to obtain patents in various jurisdictions on our current and future technologies and products, to defend our patents and protect our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. There can be no assurance that our patents will not be challenged by third parties or that, if challenged, those patents will be held valid. In addition, there can be no assurance that any technologies or products developed by us will not be challenged by third parties owning patent rights and, if challenged, will be held not to infringe on those patent rights. The expense involved in any patent litigation can be significant. We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology, and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop or obtain similar products or technologies.\nWe may expand our business through acquisitions.\nWe occasionally review acquisition candidates. Factors which may affect our ability to grow successfully through acquisitions include:\n\u00b7 inability to obtain financing;\n\u00b7 difficulties and expenses in connection with integrating the acquired companies and achieving the expected benefits;\n\u00b7 diversion of management\u2019s attention from current operations;\n\u00b7 the possibility that we may be adversely affected by risk factors facing the acquired companies;\n\u00b7 acquisitions could be dilutive to earnings, or in the event of acquisitions made through the issuance of our common shares to the shareholders of the acquired company, dilutive to the percentage of ownership of our existing stockholders;\n\u00b7 potential losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of acquired companies not covered by the indemnification we may obtain from the seller; and\n\u00b7 loss of key employees of the acquired companies.\nWe depend on the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.\nOver the past several years, some areas of our businesses have grown significantly as a result of the increase in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies outsourcing their preclinical and clinical research support activities. We believe that due to the significant investment in facilities and personnel required to support drug development, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies look to outsource some or all of those services. By doing so, they can focus their resources on their core competency of drug discovery, while obtaining the outsourced services from a full-service provider like us. Our revenues depend greatly on the expenditures made by these pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in research and development. In some instances, companies in these industries are reliant on their ability to raise capital in order to fund their research and development projects and to compensate us for services rendered. Accordingly, economic factors and industry trends that affect our customers in these industries also affect our business. If companies in these industries were to reduce the number of research and development projects they conduct or outsource, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business.\n\t\nWhile it is difficult for us to predict the impact of general economic conditions on our business, these conditions could reduce customer demand for some of our services, which could cause our revenue to decline. Also, our customers, particularly smaller biotechnology companies which are especially reliant on the credit and capital markets, may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit or equity funding, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to us. Moreover, we rely on credit facilities to provide working capital to support our operations and regularly evaluate alternative financing sources. Changes in the commercial credit market or in the financial stability of our creditors may impact the ability of our creditors to provide additional financing. In addition, the financial condition of our credit facility providers, which is beyond our control, may adversely change. Any decrease in our access to borrowings under our credit facility or successor facilities (if any), tightening of lending standards and other changes to our sources of liquidity could adversely impact our ability to obtain the financing we need to continue operating the business in our current manner. For these reasons, among others, if economic conditions stagnate or decline, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on air transportation to serve our customers.\nOur business is heavily reliant on air travel for transport of samples and other material, products and people. A significant disruption to the air travel system, or our access to it, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nPrivacy regulations could increase our costs or limit our services.\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 demand compliance with patient privacy and confidentiality requirements. In addition, some state governments are considering more stringent regulations. These regulations might require us to increase our investment in security or limit the services we offer. We could be found liable if we fail to meet existing or proposed regulations on privacy and security of health information.\nWe may be affected by health care reform.\nIn March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cPPACA\u201d) intended over time to expand health insurance coverage and impose health industry cost containment measures. PPACA legislation and the accompanying regulations may significantly impact the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries as it is implemented over the next several years. In addition, the U.S. Congress, various state legislatures and European and Asian governments may consider various types of health care reform in order to control growing health care costs. We are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future, if any.\nImplementation of health care reform legislation may have certain benefits but also may contain costs that could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs. This could adversely affect research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to us both in the United States and abroad. In addition, new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability, increase our costs or limit our service offerings.\nRisks Related to Share Ownership\nOur share price could be volatile and our trading volume may fluctuate substantially.\nThe market price of our common shares has historically experienced and might continue to experience volatility. Many factors could have a significant impact on the future price of our common shares, including:\n\u00b7 our failure to successfully implement our business objectives;\n\u00b7 compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 market acceptance of our products;\n\u00b7 technological innovations, new commercial products or drug discovery efforts and preclinical and clinical activities by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 changes in government regulations;\n\u00b7 general economic conditions and other external factors;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results;\n\u00b7 the degree of trading liquidity in our common shares; and\n\u00b7 our ability to meet the minimum standards required for remaining listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nThese factors also include ones beyond our control, such as market conditions within our industry and changes in pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. The stock market, and in particular the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnology company stocks, has also experienced significant decreases in value in the past. This volatility and valuation decline have affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies, often for reasons unrelated to their operating performance, and might adversely affect the price of our common shares.\nIf we are unable to maintain listing of our securities on the NASDAQ Capital Market or another reputablestock exchange, it may be more difficult for the Company's shareholders to sell their securities.\nNASDAQ requires listing issuers to comply with certain standards in order to remain listed on its exchange. If, for any reason, NASDAQ should delist the Company's securities from trading on its exchange and the Company is unable to obtain listing on another reputable national securities exchange, a reduction in some or all of the following may occur, each of which could materially adversely affect our shareholders:\n\u00b7 the liquidity of our common shares;\n\u00b7 the market price of our common shares;\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations;\n\u00b7 the number of institutional and general investors that will consider investing in our common shares;\n\u00b7 the number of market makers in our common shares;\n\u00b7 the availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of our common shares; and\n\u00b7 the number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our common shares.\nThere is no public market for the Series A preferred shares or warrants to purchase common shares.\nThere is no established public trading market for the Series A preferred shares and the warrants that were sold May 11, 2011, and we do not expect a market to develop. In addition, we have not and do not intend to apply to list the Series A preferred shares or the warrants on any securities exchange. Without an active market, the liquidity of these securities is limited.\nWe have never paid cash dividends and currently do not intend to do so.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common shares. We currently plan to retain any earnings to finance the growth of our business rather than to pay cash dividends. Payments of any cash dividends in the future will depend on our financial condition, results of operations and capital requirements, as well as other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.", "PERMNO": 85526, "SIC": 8731, "TIC": "BASI"}
