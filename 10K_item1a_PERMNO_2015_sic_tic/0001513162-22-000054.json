{"cik": "99106", "company": "TRANS LUX Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-04-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nTHERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has issued an opinion on our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that states that the Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and further states that the continuing losses and uncertainty regarding our ability to make the required minimum funding contributions to the defined benefit pension plan and the past due principal and interest payments on our outstanding 8\u00bc% Limited convertible senior subordinated notes due 2012 (the \u201cNotes\u201d) and 9\u00bd% Subordinated debentures due 2012 (the \u201cDebentures\u201d) raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, if we are unable to (i) obtain additional liquidity for working capital, (ii) make the required minimum funding contributions to the defined benefit pension plan, (iii) make the required principal and interest payments on the Notes and the Debentures and/or (iv) repay our obligations under our Credit Agreement (hereinafter defined) with Unilumin North America Inc. (\u201cUnilumin\u201d), there would be a significant adverse impact on our financial position and operating results.\nWE HAVE EXPERIENCED OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO INCREASE OUR REVENUE SUFFICIENTLY TO GENERATE THE CASH REQUIRED TO FUND OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS\nWe have incurred operating losses for the past several years. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred losses of $5.0 million and $4.8 million, respectively. We are dependent upon future operating performance and, to the extent that operating performance falls short of our needs, future financing to generate sufficient cash flows to continue to run our businesses. Future operating performance is dependent on general economic conditions, as well as financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We have experienced a decline in our lease and maintenance bases for the past several years. In addition, our ability to achieve profitability is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control including the impact of the current economic environment, the spread of major epidemics (including coronavirus) and other related uncertainties such as government imposed travel restrictions, interruptions to supply chains and extended shut down of businesses. These macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition in a number of ways. For example, current or potential customers may delay or decrease spending with us or may not pay us or may delay paying us for previously performed services.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to increase our revenue sufficiently to generate the cash required to fund our current operations, and to the extent we are unable to do so, we may need to undertake additional financings. In addition, we cannot predict whether future financing, if any, will be in the form of equity, debt, or a combination of both. We may not be able to obtain additional funds on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. Any equity financing we receive could be substantially dilutive to our shareholders.\nWE HAVE SIGNIFICANT DEBT, WHICH COULD IMPAIR OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding debt of approximately $3.5 million, of which $3.0 million was reflected under current portion of long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet. Such amount includes an aggregate of $522,000 of 8\u00bc% Limited convertible senior subordinated notes due 2012 (the \u201cNotes\u201d) and 9\u00bd% Subordinated debentures due 2012 (the \u201cDebentures\u201d) for which we are in default. Our ability to satisfy our obligations will be dependent upon our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, including factors beyond our control. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $524,000 and there can be no assurance that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our long-term debt service requirements or that we will be able to refinance indebtedness at maturity. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nWE MAY NOT MEET OUR LOAN COVENANTS\nThe Loan Agreement with Unilumin contains financial and other covenant requirements, including financial covenants that require the Borrowers to attain certain EBITDA amounts for certain periods. If we are not able to attain the EBITDA amounts required by the covenant, Unilumin may exercise certain remedies, including termination of the Loan Agreement, which would have a significant adverse impact on our financial position and operating results.\nLIBOR IS EXPECTED TO BE DISCONTINUED AFTER 2021\nOur Loan Agreement with Unilumin provides procedures for determining a replacement or alternative rate in the event that LIBOR is unavailable. However, there can be no assurance as to whether such replacement or alternative rate will be more or less favorable than LIBOR. We intend to monitor the developments with respect to the potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 and will work with Unilumin to ensure any transition away from LIBOR will have minimal impact on our financial condition. We however can provide no assurance regarding the impact of the discontinuation of LIBOR on the interest rate that we would be required to pay or on our financial condition.\nNON-PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON OUTSTANDING NOTES AND DEBENTURES HAS RESULTED IN EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND MAY CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BALANCE SHEET\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding $302,000 of Notes. The Notes matured as of March 1, 2012 and are currently in default. The trustee, by notice to us, or the holders of 25% of the principal amount of the Notes outstanding, by notice to us and the trustee, may declare the outstanding principal plus interest due and payable immediately.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding $220,000 of Debentures. The Debentures matured as of December 1, 2012 and are currently in default. The trustee, by notice to us, or the holders of 25% of the principal amount of the Debentures outstanding, by notice to us and the trustee, may declare the outstanding principal plus interest due and payable immediately.\nOUR INDEBTEDNESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL HEALTH\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences to you. For example, it could: increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our creditors, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds or increase our cost of borrowing.\nCOMPETITORS MAY POSSESS SUPERIOR RESOURCES AND DELIVER MORE MARKETABLE PRODUCTS, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING MARGINS\nOur digital products compete with a number of competitors, both larger and smaller than us, and with products based on different forms of technology. In addition, there are several competitors whose current products utilize similar technology and who possess the resources to develop competitive and more sophisticated products in the future. Our success is, to some extent, dependent upon our ability to anticipate technological changes in the industry and to successfully identify, obtain, develop and market new products that satisfy evolving industry requirements. There can be no assurance that competitors will not market new products which may have perceived advantages over our products or which, because of pricing strategies, render the products currently sold by us less marketable or would otherwise adversely affect our operating margins.\nOUR SUCCESS IS PARTIALLY DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN THE RENEWAL OF EXISTING LEASES OR ENTER INTO NEW LEASES AS OUR CURRENT LEASES EXPIRE, WHICH MAY NOT BE FEASIBLE. THE INABILITY TO RENEW OR REPLACE OUR LEASES WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS\nWe derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from the leasing of our digital products, generally pursuant to leases that have an average term of one to five years. Consequently, our future success is, at a minimum, dependent on our ability to obtain the renewal of existing leases or to enter into new leases as existing leases expire. We also derive a significant percentage of our revenues from maintenance agreements relating to our digital display products. The average term of such agreements is one to five years. A portion of the maintenance agreements is cancelable upon 30 days notice. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining the renewal of existing leases or maintenance agreements, obtaining replacement leases or realizing the value of assets currently under leases that are not renewed. We expect our success in obtaining the renewal of existing leases or maintenance agreements or obtaining replacement leases will also be negatively impacted by the economic uncertainty arising from the impact of the coronavirus which has caused disruptions and extreme volatility in global financial markets and is expected to increase rates of default and bankruptcy, and impact levels of consumer and commercial spending. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations.\u201d\nWE ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL\nWe believe that our Chief Executive Officer, Nicholas J. Fazio, plays a significant role in our success and the loss of his services could have an adverse effect on us. We have no employment agreement with Mr. Fazio and there can be no assurance that we would be able to find a suitable replacement for Mr. Fazio. We believe that in addition to Mr. Fazio, there is a core group of executives that also plays a significant role in our success.\nOUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO POTENTIAL FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR AND FOREIGN CURRENCIES, AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY\nOur financial condition, operating results and future growth could be significantly impacted by risks associated with our international activities, including specifically changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies and international tax rules. Because a portion of our business is transacted in Canada dollars, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar could seriously impact our manufacturing and other costs, as well as overall profitability. The risks to our business related to fluctuations in currency exchange rates is further magnified by the current volatility in the currency markets that are characteristic of financial markets, and currency markets in particular.\nCompliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), foreign exchange controls, anti-money laundering and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, labor laws and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions, and may subject us to additional costs which may arise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation. We have not implemented formal policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with all of these laws and regulations. Any such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition or operating results.\nOUR RELIANCE UPON THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS IN CHINA COULD SUBJECT US TO POLITICAL AND LEGAL RISKS BEYOND OUR CONTROL\nMany components of our products are produced in China by third-party manufacturers. Our reliance on third-party Chinese manufacturers exposes us to risks that are not in our control, such as unanticipated cost increases, negative fluctuations in currency or the impact of the coronavirus on the ability of the third-party Chinese manufacturers to provide product and international commerce, which could negatively impact our results of operations and working capital. Any termination of or significant disruption in our relationship with our Chinese suppliers may prevent us from filling customer orders in a timely manner. Given the state of the Chinese political system, we cannot guaranty that our agreements with our Chinese suppliers will remain enforceable pursuant to Chinese law. Furthermore, we cannot guaranty that all rights to payment or performance under our agreements with our Chinese manufacturing partners will be enforceable and that all debts owing to us, whether in the form of cash or product, will be collectible. While we do not envision any adverse change to our international operations or suppliers, especially given the gradual move towards global integration by the Chinese government and financial markets, adverse changes to these operations as a result of political, governmental, regulatory, economic, exchange rate, labor, health-related, logistical or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results.\nOUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of the 2019 novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, on all aspects of our business. In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic and the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency. Since then, the COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread across the globe and has already resulted in significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused and may continue to cause travel bans or disruptions, and in some cases, prohibitions of non-essential activities, disruption and shutdown of businesses and greater uncertainty in global financial markets. The impact of COVID-19 is fluid and uncertain, but it has caused and may continue to cause various negative effects, including an inability to meet with actual or potential customers, our end customers deciding to delay or abandon their planned purchases or failing to make payments, and delays or disruptions in our or our partners\u2019 supply chains. As a result, we may experience extended sales cycles, our ability to close transactions with new and existing customers and partners may be negatively impacted, and the efficiency and effect of those activities, may be negatively affected, and it has been and, until the COVID-19 outbreak is contained, will continue to be more difficult for us to forecast our operating results. These uncertainties have, and may continue to, put pressure on global economic conditions and overall LED display spending and may cause our end customers to modify spending priorities or delay or abandon purchasing decisions, thereby lengthening sales cycles and potentially lowering prices for our solutions, and may make it difficult for us to forecast our sales and operating results and to make decisions about future investments, any of which could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFurther, our management team is focused on addressing the impacts of COVID-19 on our business, which has required and will continue to require, a large investment of their time and resources and may distract our management team or disrupt our 2022 operating plans. The extent to which COVID-19 ultimately impacts our results of operations, cash flow and financial position will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions taken by governments and authorities to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including as a result of any recession that may occur.\nSUPPLIERS MAY BE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO FURNISH US WITH REQUIRED COMPONENTS, WHICH MAY DELAY OR REDUCE OUR PRODUCT SHIPMENTS AND NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS\nWe design certain of our products to match components furnished by suppliers. If such suppliers were unable or unwilling to provide us with those components, we would have to contract with other suppliers to obtain replacement sources. In particular, we purchase most of the LEDs and LED module blocks used in our digital products from three main suppliers. We do not have long-term supply contracts with these suppliers. A change in suppliers of either LED module blocks or certain other components may result in engineering design changes, as well as delays in obtaining such replacement components. We believe that there are presently other qualified vendors of these components. Our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of certain components as required, or to develop alternative sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable time, could result in delays or reductions in product shipments that could have a materially adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCYBER-ATTACKS AND BREACHES COULD CAUSE OPERATIONAL DISRUPTIONS, FRAUD OR THEFT OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION\nAspects of our operations are reliant upon internet-based activities, such as ordering supplies and back-office functions such as accounting and transaction processing, making and accepting payments, processing payroll and other administrative functions, etc. Although we have taken measures to protect our technology systems and infrastructure, including employee education programs regarding cybersecurity, a breach of the security surrounding these functions could result in operational disruptions, theft or fraud, or exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized parties. A significant disruption or failure of our information technology systems may have a significant impact on our operations, potentially resulting in service interruptions, security violations, regulatory compliance failures and other operational difficulties. In addition, any attack perpetrated against our information systems, including through a system failure, security breach or disruption by malware or other damage, could similarly impact our operations and result in loss or misuse of information, litigation and potential liability. Although we have taken steps intended to mitigate the risks presented by potential cyber incidents, it is not possible to protect against every potential power loss, telecommunications failure, cybersecurity attack or similar event that may arise. Moreover, the safeguards we use are subject to human implementation and maintenance and to other uncertainties. Any of these cyber incidents may result in a violation of applicable laws or regulations (including privacy and other laws), damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers and give rise to monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant. Such events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nINCREASED PRICES AND INFLATION COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\nThough we believe that the rates of inflation in recent years have not had a significant impact on our operations, a continued increase in inflation, including inflationary pressure on labor and the goods and services we rely upon to deliver service to our customers, could result in increases to our operating costs, and we may be unable to pass these costs on to our customers. If inflation in these costs increases beyond our ability to control for them through measures such as implementing operating efficiencies, we may not be able to increase prices to sufficiently offset the effect of various cost increases without negatively impacting customer demand, thereby increasing our costs of doing business and reducing our margins. If such impacts are prolonged and substantial, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWE ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING IN A PERIOD OF ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND CAPITAL MARKETS DISRUPTION, WHICH HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY GEOPOLITICAL INSTABILITY DUE TO THE ONGOING MILITARY CONFLICT BETWEEN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE. OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ANY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND CAPITAL MARKETS RESULTING FROM THE CONFLICT IN UKRAINE OR ANY OTHER GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS\nU.S. and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation of geopolitical tensions and the start of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. On February 24, 2022, a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops was reported. Although the length and impact of the ongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable, the conflict in Ukraine could lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain interruptions. We are continuing to monitor the situation in Ukraine and globally and assessing its potential impact on our business.\nAdditionally, Russia\u2019s prior annexation of Crimea, recent recognition of two separatist republics in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine and subsequent military interventions in Ukraine have led to sanctions and other penalties being levied by the United States, European Union and other countries against Russia, Belarus, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, and the so-called Luhansk People\u2019s Republic, including agreements to remove certain Russian financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication payment system. Additional potential sanctions and penalties have also been proposed and/or threatened. Russian military actions and the resulting sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets and lead to instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets, potentially making it more difficult for us to obtain additional funds.\nAny of the abovementioned factors could affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions are impossible to predict, but could be substantial. Any such disruptions may also magnify the impact of other risks described in this Form 10-K.\nFAILURE TO MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ON A TIMELY AND ACCURATE BASIS\nFailure to maintain appropriate and effective internal controls over our financial reporting could result in misstatements in our financial statements and potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, and could cause us to delay the filing of required reports with the SEC and our reporting of financial results. Any of these events could result in a decline in the market price of our Common Stock. Although we have taken steps to maintain our internal control structure as required, we cannot guarantee that a control deficiency will not result in a misstatement in the future.\nEFFECT OF CERTAIN ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS AND CONTROL BY EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (our \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d) contains certain provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of the Company. Such provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock, thus making it less likely that a stockholder will receive a premium on any sale of shares of our Common Stock. Our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, each of which serves for a staggered three-year term, making it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our Board. Our Certificate of Incorporation also contains a provision that requires a four-fifths vote on any merger, consolidation or sale of assets with or to an \u201cInterested Person\u201d or \u201cAcquiring Person,\u201d as well as any amendment to the provision which divides the Board into three classes.\nAdditionally, we are authorized to issue 2,500,000 shares of preferred stock, of which (i) 416,500 are designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, none of which are outstanding, and (ii) 51,000 are designated as Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSBCPS\u201d), none of which are outstanding. The remaining unissued preferred stock, if issued, will contain such rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions as may be fixed by our Board of Directors, which may adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of Common Stock or delay, defer or prevent a change in control of the Company, or discourage bids for the Common Stock at a premium over its market price or otherwise adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock.\nThese provisions and others that could be adopted in the future could deter unsolicited takeovers or delay or prevent changes in our control or management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. These provisions may also limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.\nCONCENTRATION OF OWNERSHIP AMONG OUR PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS MAY LIMIT OUR OTHER STOCKHOLDERS FROM INFLUENCING SIGNIFICANT COMPANY DECISIONS\nAs of April 13, 2022, one stockholder, Unilumin North America Inc. (\u201cUnilumin\u201d), owns approximately 52.0% of our Common Stock and beneficially owns approximately 53.7% of our Common Stock. In addition, three of the Company\u2019s four directors are employed by Unilumin or other entities affiliated with Unilumin. Accordingly, such stockholder could exert significant control over any potential stockholder actions. The interests of this stockholder may not align with our interests or the interests of other stockholders and thereby could control our policies and operations, including the election of directors, the appointment of management, future issuances of our Common Stock or other securities, the incurrence or modification of debt by us, amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws, and the entering of extraordinary transactions, such as a merger or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, this majority stockholder will be able to cause or prevent a change of control of the Company and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of the Company. This concentration of ownership could deprive stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of Common Stock as part of a sale of the Company and ultimately might affect the market price of the Common Stock.\nWE DO NOT EXPECT TO PAY ANY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE\nWe currently expect to retain all future earnings, if any, for future operation, expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends to holders of our Common Stock for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our operating results, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, we must comply with the covenants in our credit agreement in order to be able to pay cash dividends, and our ability to pay dividends generally may be further limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our Common Stock unless you sell our Common Stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nOUR COMMON STOCK IS QUOTED ON OTC PINK AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIMITED TRADING VOLUME AND PRICE VOLATILITY\nOur Common Stock is quoted on the OTC Pink, an inter-dealer electronic quotation and trading system for equity securities. Quotation of our Common Stock on OTC Pink may limit the liquidity and price of our Common Stock more than if our Common Stock were quoted or listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market or another national exchange. Some investors may perceive our Common Stock to be less attractive because it is traded in the over-the-counter market. In addition, as an OTC Pink company, we do not attract the extensive analyst coverage that accompanies companies listed on national exchanges. Further, institutional and other investors may have investment guidelines that restrict or prohibit investing in securities traded on OTC Pink. These factors may have an adverse impact on the trading and price of our Common Stock.\nOur Common Stock is not widely held and the volume of trading has been relatively low and sporadic. Accordingly, our Common Stock is subject to increased price volatility and reduced liquidity. There can be no assurance that a more active trading market for our Common Stock will develop or be sustained if it does develop. The market price of our Common Stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things, the factors described in the sections entitled \u201cSafe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the general state of the securities markets and the market for similar stocks, changes in capital markets that affect the perceived availability of capital to companies in our industry, and governmental legislation or regulation, as well as general economic and market conditions.", "PERMNO": 37460, "SIC": 3990, "TIC": "TNLX"}
