RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and the other information set forth elsewhere in this current report. If any of these risks occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline, perhaps significantly.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMPANY\nWe may be unable to continue as a going concern based on our recent performance, which has included significant losses and a working capital deficit. We may continue to generate losses and be unable to service our outstanding liabilities in the future.\nWe incurred operating losses and had negative operating cash flows and may continue to generate negative cash flows as we implement our business plan for 2016. There can be no assurance that our continuing efforts to execute our business plan will be successful and that we will be able to continue as a going concern as our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm has indicated these factors raised substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Our net loss attributable to shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $12,014,594 as compared to $26,863,297 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The operating results for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 included $0 and $3,003,809, respectively, of net losses related to an impairment loss recorded on the Airport International Auto Mall, and included $4,281,414 and $16,041,383, respectively, of net losses related to impairment loss on goodwill and intangible asset.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had a working capital deficit of $30,801,730, including $67,290,734 in current liabilities for short-term borrowings which are due during the period between January and August 2016, and $35,742,198 in current liabilities payable to Hezhong related to the Zhonghe Acquisition, which is due in May and November of 2016, and for which we do not currently have the necessary capital to re-pay.\nNet cash used in operations during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $7,380,041 and $54,440,890, respectively.\nWe invested heavily in Car King Tianjin through cash investments and leasing a portion of the Airport International Auto Mall to Car King Tianjin to operate a used car business. We believe that there is a strong market for used car sales in China and Car King Tianjin will provide us with opportunities for long-term growth. However we cannot precisely predict the extent of the growth and whether such growth will convert into substantial profits in the future.\nWe do not currently have sufficient cash or commitments for financing to sustain our operations for the next twelve months. Our plan continues to be to develop new client and customer relationships and to substantially increase our cash flow and revenue derived from our products/services. If our revenues do not reach the level anticipated in our plan, we may require additional financing in order to execute our operating plan. If additional financing is required, we cannot predict whether this additional financing will be in the form of equity, debt, or another form, and we may not be able to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. In the event that financing sources are not available, or that we are unsuccessful in increasing our revenues and profits, we may be unable to implement our current plans for expansion, repay our debt obligations or respond to competitive pressures, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may adversely change due to the cyclical nature of the automotive industry. If the Chinese luxury automotive market does not grow as anticipated or grows at a slower rate than we expect, our sales and profitability may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur financial performance depends, in large part, on the varying conditions in the automotive markets, specifically the market for imported luxury automobiles in China. The volume of automobile production in Asia, North America, Europe and the rest of the world has fluctuated, sometimes significantly, from year to year, and such fluctuations often are in response to overall economic conditions and factors such as changes in interest rate levels, vehicle manufacturer incentive programs, fuel costs, consumer spending and confidence, and environmental issues. If the automotive market experiences a downturn, our results of operations and business will suffer.\nWe derive most of our sales revenue from sales of imported automobiles and related services in China. The continued development of our business depends, in large part, on continued growth in the luxury automotive market in China and the increase in disposable income among the Chinese population. Although China\u2019s luxury automotive market has grown rapidly in the past, it may not continue to grow at the same rate in the future or at all. However, the developments in our market are, to a large extent, outside of our control and any reduced demand for imported automobiles or related services, or any other downturn or other adverse changes in China\u2019s economy that impacts the disposable income of ultimate luxury car purchasers could severely harm our business.\nOur business may adversely be affected due to the government policy on restrictions on automobile purchases.\nThe local governments of various cities in China imposed restrictions on automobile purchases. Through December 31, 2015, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Guiyang, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Hangzhou and Shenzhen had adopted such restrictions. The restrictions vary from city to city, however most of these cities set an annual limit on the maximum number of vehicles in each category that may be licensed, in order to limit the number of new vehicles added to the roads each year. Some cities, such as Beijing, have adopted a lottery system wherein only potential buyers who win the lottery draw will be able to purchase vehicles. As more cities become subject to these and similar purchase restrictions, the future growth in the automobile market in China will be negatively impacted. As a result, our future growth may be negatively impacted.\nA disproportionate amount of our income (loss) from operations is derived from the sale of imported automobiles and related services, and a disruption in, or compromise of, our sale operations or our ability to provide Financing Services could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2015, our operating income (loss) is allocated to each segment in percentage as follows:\nWe view our Sales of Automobiles and Financing services to be our core segments. A disruption in providing such sales and services to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In March 2014, we began to operate the used car sales business through Car King Tianjin at the Airport International Auto Mall under the Airport Auto Mall Automotive Services segment. Effective March 1, 2014, we no longer perform the Auto Mall Management Services, as the services agreement entered into by and between the Company and Tianjin Prominent Hero International Logistics Co., Ltd. expired and was not renewed.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers and purchase a significant portion of our inventories from a limited number of suppliers. Certain of our major customers are also major suppliers, and therefore the loss of such customers or suppliers could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe derived a significant portion of our revenues on an aggregate basis from our top five customers, and a significant portion of our purchases comes from our top five suppliers. Some of our customers are also our suppliers. We maintain close working relationships with our top customers and suppliers and continue to reduce the business concentration of our revenues and purchases among our top customers and suppliers. While we do not believe that the loss of any one major customer or supplier in and of itself would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation, the loss of more than one such major customer or supplier, or our failure to replace such customer or supplier with other customers and suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our results of operations.\nThe imported automobile sales and services market in Tianjin is competitive; failure to maintain our current relationships with various Chinese banks or to renew existing credit lines or enter into new credit lines may hamper our growth and negatively affect our results.\nAs a one-stop service provider in Tianjin, our market share in Financing Services has maintained its leading position in Tianjin. However, in the future we anticipate increasing pressure on our business from competitors, and failure to maintain our relationships with various Chinese banks in Tianjin may adversely affect our ability to provide Financing Services and other automotive related services to our customers. In addition, if our competitors are able to establish similar relationships with these banks or other financial institutions in Tianjin or our future markets, we will no longer enjoy our current competitive advantage. Furthermore, in order to obtain and maintain the lines of credit with various banks, certain of our executives, long term customers, suppliers and business partners act as guarantors for these lines of credit, loss of supports from any of these parties will negatively impact our ability to continue competing in the Financing Services market.\nAs of March 30, 2016, the Company had aggregate credit lines of $166 million (RMB1.08 billion) with its banks. We are currently negotiating a number of new credit lines with various banks, although there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in doing so. If we are unable to renew existing credit lines or enter into new credit lines on a consistent basis that allows us to meet the requirements of our business or the demand of our customers for Financing Services, our business, operating margins, financial condition, cash flows and profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe face competition from other companies, which could force us to lower our prices, thereby adversely affecting our operating margins, financial condition, cash flows and profitability.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and this competition could harm our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. We believe that one significant competitive factor for our products is selling price. Although we do not aspire to be the lowest cost provider but rather the highest value provider to our customers, we could be subject to adverse results caused by our competitors\u2019 pricing decisions. The average selling prices for our automobiles have been on a downward trend in recent years and our gross margins have continued to decline due to stiff competition in the automobile industry which has resulted in lower net profits. If we do not compete successfully, our business, operating margins, financial condition, cash flows and profitability could be adversely affected.\nConcerns about security of e-commerce transactions and confidentiality of information on the Internet may reduce the use of our websites and impede our growth, and our Internet operations may be vulnerable to hacking, viruses and other disruptions.\nA significant barrier to e-commerce and confidential communications over the Internet has been the need for security. Internet usage could decline if any well-publicized compromise of security occurred. We may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches. If unauthorized persons are able to penetrate our network security, they could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services. As a result, we may be required to expend capital and resources to protect against or to alleviate these problems. Security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot assure you that our organic growth strategy will be successful.\nOne of our growth strategies is to grow organically through increasing the distribution and sales of our products, increasing our market share and entering new geographical markets in the PRC. However, many obstacles to increasing our market share and entering such new markets exist, including but not limited to, costs associated with entering into such markets and attendant marketing efforts. We cannot therefore assure you that we will be able to successfully overcome such obstacles and establish our products in any additional markets. Our inability to implement this organic growth strategy successfully may have a negative impact on our ability to grow and on our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf we are not able to implement our strategies in achieving our business objectives, our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected.\nOur business plan is based on circumstances currently prevailing and the bases and assumptions that certain circumstances will or will not occur, as well as the inherent risks and uncertainties involved in various stages of development. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our strategies or that our strategies, even if implemented, will lead to the successful achievement of our objectives. If we are not able to successfully implement our strategies, our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to manage our expanding operations effectively, which could harm our business.\nWe anticipate expanding our business as we address growth in our customer base and market opportunities. In addition, the geographic dispersion of our operations as a result of overall internal growth requires significant management resources that our locally-based competitors do not need to devote to their operations. In order to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will be required to improve and implement operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, and expand, train and manage our growing employee base. Further, our management will be required to maintain and expand our strategic relationships necessary to our business. We cannot assure you that our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future operations. If we are not successful in establishing, maintaining and managing our personnel, systems, procedures and controls, our business will be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business and growth could suffer if we are unable to retain our key executives.\nWe depend upon the continued contributions of our senior management and other key executives, many of whom are difficult to replace. In particular, our future success is heavily dependent upon the continued service of Mr. Tong Shiping, Ms. Wang Xinwei, and Ms. Cheng Weihong. If one or more of our key executives are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to easily replace them, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if any of these key executives joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose customers and suppliers and incur additional expenses to recruit and train personnel. Each of our executive officers has entered into standard employment agreements with us (in accordance with the format issued by the Labor and Social Security Administration in Tianjin and Chongqing) but is not subject to specific non-competition or non-solicitation agreements, as such agreements are not standard in China. We also do not maintain key-man life insurance for any of our key executives.\nWe face a competitive labor market in China for skilled personnel and therefore are highly dependent on the skills and services of our existing key skilled personnel and our ability to hire additional skilled employees.\nCompetition for highly-skilled software design, technical, managerial, finance, marketing, sales and customer service personnel is intense in China. Failure to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs could impair our growth. Limitations on our ability to hire and train a sufficient number of personnel at all levels would limit our ability to undertake projects in the future and could cause us to lose market share. We may need to increase the levels of our employee compensation more rapidly than in the past in order to remain competitive. These additional costs could reduce our profitability and cause losses.\nIf we need additional capital to fund our growing operations, we may not be able to obtain sufficient capital and may be forced to limit the scope of our operations.\nAs we implement our growth strategies, we may experience increased capital needs and we may not have enough capital to fund our future operations without additional capital investments. Our capital needs will depend on numerous factors, including: (i) our profitability; (ii) the release of competitive products by our competition; (iii) the level of our investment in research and development; and (iv) the amount of our capital expenditures. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain capital in the future to meet our needs.\nIf we cannot obtain additional funding, we may be required to limit our marketing efforts and decrease or eliminate capital expenditures.\nSuch reductions could materially and adversely affect our business and our ability to compete. Even if we do find a source of additional capital, we may not be able to negotiate terms and conditions for receiving the additional capital that are acceptable to us. Any future capital investments could dilute or otherwise materially and adversely affect the holdings or rights of investors in our common stock. We cannot give you any assurance that any additional financing will be available to us, or if available, will be on terms favorable to us.\nWe have limited insurance coverage and do not carry any business interruption or third party liability insurance or insurance that covers the risk of loss of automobiles in shipment.\nOperation of our facilities involves many risks, including natural disasters, power outages, labor disturbances and other business interruptions. We do not carry any business interruption insurance or third-party liability insurance for accidents on our property or damage relating to our operations. In addition, our existing insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all risks associated with our business. As a result, we may be required to pay for financial and other losses, damages and liabilities, including those caused by natural disasters and other events beyond our control, out of our own funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur efforts in protecting our intellectual property rights from infringement may not be sufficient, and our failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position.\nWe regard our domain name registrations and other intellectual property as critical to our success. Our domain names for our websites are currently registered domain names. However, no assurance can be given that such registrations and licenses will not be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented or that such intellectual property rights will provide a competitive advantage to us.\nCurrently we sell our products only in China. China will remain our primary market for the foreseeable future. To date, no trademark filings have been made. Therefore, the measures we take to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate and we cannot give you any assurance that our competitors will not independently develop formulations and processes (including websites similar to www.at188.com and www.at160.com) that are substantially equivalent or superior to our own or copy our products.\nIntellectual property related laws in China may not be effective in protecting our intellectual property rights, and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights may be costly.\nWe strive to strengthen and differentiate our product portfolio by developing new and innovative products and product improvements. As a result, we believe that the protection of our intellectual property will become increasingly important to our business. Implementation and enforcement of intellectual property-related laws in China has historically been lacking due primarily to ambiguities in PRC intellectual property law. Accordingly, protection of intellectual property and proprietary rights in China may not be as effective as in the United States or other countries. As a result, third parties may use the technologies and proprietary processes that we have developed and compete with us, which could negatively affect any competitive advantage we enjoy, dilute our brand and harm our operating results.\nIn addition, policing the unauthorized use of our proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, and given the relative unpredictability of China\u2019s legal system and potential difficulties enforcing a court judgment in China, there is no guarantee litigation would result in an outcome favorable to us. Furthermore, any such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention away from our core business. An adverse determination in any lawsuit involving our intellectual property is likely to jeopardize our business prospects and reputation. We have no insurance coverage against litigation costs so we would be forced to bear all litigation costs if we cannot recover them from other parties. All of the foregoing factors could harm our business and financial condition.\nWe may be exposed to infringement claims by third parties, which, if successful, could cause us to pay significant damage awards.\nThird parties may initiate litigation against us alleging infringement of their proprietary rights. In the event of a successful claim of infringement and our failure or inability to develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis, our business could be harmed. In addition, even if we are able to license the infringed or similar technology, license fees could be substantial and may adversely affect our results of operations.\nUnexpected network interruptions caused by system failures may result in reduced visitor traffic, reduced revenue and harm to our reputation.\nAs the number of Chinese websites and the amount of Chinese Internet traffic increases, we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase the scale of our systems proportionately. We are also dependent upon web browsers, Internet service providers, content providers and other website operators in China, which have experienced significant system failures and system outages in the past. Any system failure or inadequacy that causes interruptions in the availability of our services, or increases the response time of our services, as a result of increased traffic or otherwise, could reduce our user satisfaction, future traffic and our attractiveness to users and advertisers.\nIn addition, we have limited backup systems and redundancy and we have experienced system failures and electrical outages from time to time in the past which have disrupted our operations. We do not have a disaster recovery plan in the event of damage from fire, floods, typhoons, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events. If any of the foregoing occurs, we may experience a complete system shut-down. We do not carry any business interruption insurance. To improve the performance and to prevent disruption of our services, we may have to make substantial investments to deploy additional servers or one or more copies of our websites to mirror our online resources. To the extent we do not address the capacity restraints and redundancy described above, such constraints could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAcquisitions could have negative consequences, which could harm our business.\nOn November 30, 2013, we signed the Auto Mall Acquisition Agreement to purchase 100% of the equity of Zhonghe, which owns and operates the Airport International Auto Mall. Under the terms of the Auto Mall Acquisition Agreement, Shisheng will pay RMB559,768,000 (approximately $91.4 million) to Hezhong, in four annual installments with an annualized rate of interest of 6%. The initial payment of RMB240,000,000 (approximately $39.2 million) was paid within 5 business days after the signing of the Agreement. We made an installment payment of approximately $16.3 million in November 2014 and $3.2 million in January 2015. On November 10, 2015, the Company entered into a Payment Extension Agreement with Hezhong (Tianjin) International Development Ltd. Co., the former owner of Zhonghe to extend the due date for the second $18.5 million installment payment plus interest from November 30, 2015 to May 31, 2016. The unpaid amount bears interest at a rate of 6% per annum. The final installment payment remains to be due on November 30, 2016. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we incurred substantial losses on Zhonghe primarily due to the depreciation expense on the Airport International Auto Mall. We lease a portion of the Airport International Auto Mall to Car King Tianjin to operate a used car business. We believe that there is a strong market for used car sales in China and Car King Tianjin will provide us with opportunities for long-term growth. In addition, we are considering using this facility to expand into the retail automobile sales market, which may generate overall higher gross margins. However, it is uncertain that these plans will be successfully implemented and will generate any profits.\nAdditional acquisitions could require significant capital infusions and could involve many risks including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf Difficulty integrating the acquired company\u2019s personnel, products, product roadmaps, technologies, systems, processes and operations, including product delivery, order management, and information systems;\n\u25cf Difficulty in forming the acquired company\u2019s financial policies and practices to our policies and practices and in implementing and maintaining adequate internal systems and controls over financial reporting and information systems of the acquired company;\n\u25cf Diversion of management\u2019s attention and disruption of ongoing business;\n\u25cf Difficulty in combining service and technology offerings and entering into new markets or geographical areas in which we have no or limited direct experience and where our competitors may have stronger market positions;\n\u25cf Loss of management, sales, technical or other key personnel;\n\u25cf Revenue from the acquired companies not meeting our expectations, and the potential loss of the acquired companies\u2019 customers, distributors, resellers, suppliers, or other partners;\n\u25cf Delays or difficulties and the attendant expense in evaluating, coordinating, and combining administrative, sales, research and development and other operations, facilities, and relationships with third parties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures, including financial controls and controls over information systems;\n\u25cf Incurring amortization expense related to intangible assets and recording goodwill and non-amortizable assets that will be subject to impairment testing and possible impairment charges;\n\u25cf Dilution of existing stockholders as a result of issuing equity securities, including the assumption of any stock options or other equity awards issued by the acquired company;\n\u25cf Overpayment for any acquisition or investment or unanticipated costs or liabilities;\n\u25cf Responsibility for the liabilities of the acquired company, including any potential intellectual property infringement claims or other litigation; and\n\u25cf Incurring substantial write-offs, restructuring charges, and transactional expenses.\nOur failure to manage these risks and challenges could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, if we do not successfully address these challenges in a timely manner, we may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits or synergies on which the value of a transaction was based. Future transactions could cause our financial results to differ from expectations of market analysts or investors for any given quarter, which could, in turn, cause a decline in our stock price.\nWe may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including industry and market conditions, our ability to successfully implement new business plan and marketing initiatives. On November 10, 2015, the Company entered into a Payment Extension Agreement with Hezhong (Tianjin) International Development Ltd. Co., the former owner of Zhonghe to extend the due date for the second $18.5 million installment payment plus interest from November 30, 2015 to May 31, 2016. The unpaid amount bears interest at a rate of 6% per annum. The final installment payment remains to be due on November 30, 2016. We anticipate that we may need to raise additional funds in order to grow our business, implement our business strategy and fund the future payments of the payable related to the Zhonghe Acquisition. We anticipate that any such additional funds may be raised through equity or debt financings. Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that are not favorable to us. Even if we are able to raise capital through equity or debt financings, as to which there can be no assurance, the interest of existing shareholders in our company may be diluted, and the securities we issue may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our common stock or may otherwise materially and adversely affect the holdings or rights of our existing shareholders. If we cannot obtain adequate capital, we may not be able to fully implement our business strategy and may not make the payments due to the banks or to the seller of Zhonghe, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. See also \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nWe may be required to write down our real estate property and a significant impairment charge would adversely affect our operating results.\nAt December 31, 2015, the carrying value of the Airport International Auto Mall on our consolidated balance sheet was approximately $61 million. The fair market value of this property is affected by the condition of the real estate market in China, especially in Tianjin. Even though the real estate market has been on an upward trend in recent years, it is uncertain that this trend will continue. If the Chinese real estate market declines, the market value of our real estate property may decline below its carrying value on our consolidated balance sheet. As a result, we may be required to record a significant amount of impairment charge which will adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The Company engaged a third party specialist to perform a real estate appraisal for the Airport International Auto Mall at December 31, 2015. The Company determined that the fair value of the Airport International Auto Mall exceeded its carrying value. The fair value was determined using three approaches including (i) the income approach which is based on the estimated future discounted cash flow generated from this property, (ii) the market approach which is based on the current market value of comparable properties, and (iii) the replacement cost approach. Based on results of the real estate appraisal, the fair market value exceeded the carrying value of the Airport International Auto Mall at December 31, 2015. As a result, the Company recorded no impairment on the Airport International Auto Mall during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDuring the course of the impairment evaluation for the Airport Auto Mall Automotive Services reporting unit at December 31, 2014, the Company determined that the carrying value of the Airport International Auto Mall exceeded its fair value. The fair value was determined using the income approach to valuation, which was based on the estimated future discounted cash flow generated from this property. Consequently, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $3,003,809 during the year ended December 31, 2014, which represented the excess of the carrying value of this property over its estimated fair value.\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be evaluated for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered are changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable, which include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, a decrease in future cash flows, and slower growth rates in our industry. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined, resulting in an impact on our results of operations. As of December 31, 2015, we performed an impairment test on our goodwill and customer relationships for the Sales of Automobiles unit which was initially acquired through the Zhonghe acquisition. Due to the uncertainties on implementation of the retail automobile sales and the historical net loss incurred by Zhonghe\u2019s sales of automobile reporting unit, the Company believed the indicators for impairments existed at December 31, 2015. As a result, the Company conducted a 2-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the Sales of Automobiles unit with its carrying value. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value, the management performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of Sales of Automobiles unit\u2019s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. The amount, by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, if any, was recognized as an impairment loss. Upon the completion of the evaluation, the Company concluded that an impairment on the goodwill existed at December 31, 2015. The fair values were estimated based on the future discounted cash flow generated from this reporting unit. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment loss on goodwill of $3,962,422 related to the Sales of Automobiles unit for the fiscal year 2015.\nIn addition, the customers acquired from the Zhonghe acquisition on November 30, 2013 generated substantially less sales during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to those in 2014 and the periods prior to the our acquisition. The Company measured the carrying amount of the intangible asset against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with this asset. Should the sum of the expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value of the asset being evaluated, an impairment loss would be recognized. The impairment loss would be calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. The fair value is measured based on quoted market prices, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows. The evaluation of asset impairment requires the Company to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated. These assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. Upon the completion of the evaluation, the Company concluded that an impairment on the customer relations existed at December 31, 2015. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment loss on customer relations of $318,992 related to the Sales of Automobiles unit for the fiscal year of 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company performed an impairment test on our goodwill for the Sales of Automobiles and Airport Auto Mall Automotive units. Due to the significant vacant space not being rented out at the Airport International Auto Mall property, the continued loss from Car King Tianjin, the Company\u2019s actual operating profits and cash flows being lower than expected during fiscal year 2014, and the estimated fair value being less than the carrying value for the Airport Auto Mall Automotive unit, the Company concluded that an impairment existed at December 31, 2014. The fair values were estimated based on the future discounted cash flow generated from these reporting units. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment loss on goodwill of $16,041,383 related to the Airport Auto Mall Automotive unit for the fiscal year 2014.\nWe incur significant costs ensuring compliance with US corporate governance and accounting requirements.\nWe incur significant legal and financial compliance costs associated with our public company reporting requirements, costs associated with applicable corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rules implemented by the SEC. We also expect that these applicable rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) or as executive officers. We are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these applicable rules, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.\nThe staff of our accounting department lack training and experience in U.S. accounting principles, which may result in accounting errors in the financial statements that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d).\nOur executive offices are located in Tianjin in the PRC. Our entire bookkeeping and accounting staff is located there. Our books and records are maintained in Chinese, using Chinese accounting principles. Chinese accounting principles vary in many important respects from US accounting principles. To file our Company\u2019s financial statements with the SEC, our accounting staff must convert the financial statements from Chinese accounting principles to US accounting principles. However, none of the members of our accounting staff has extensive experience or training in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP. Neither do we have any employee who has previous experience in accounting for a US public company. This situation creates a risk that the financial statements we file with the SEC will fail to present our financial condition and/or results of operations as required by SEC rules and the principles of accounting generally applied in the United States.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE PEOPLE\u2019S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\nPolitical and economic policies of the PRC government could affect our business; PRC economic reform policies or nationalization could result in a total investment loss in our common stock.\nAll of our business, assets and operations are located in China, and all of our revenues are derived from our operations in China. Accordingly, our business, financial condition and results of operations are affected to a significant degree by economic, political and legal developments in China. Changes in political, economic and social conditions in China, adjustments in PRC government policies or changes in laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The economy of China differs from the economies of most countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in a number of respects, including:\n\u25cf structure;\n\u25cf level of government involvement;\n\u25cf level of development;\n\u25cf level of capital reinvestment;\n\u25cf growth rate;\n\u25cf control of foreign exchange; and\n\u25cf methods of allocating resources.\nSince 1949, China has primarily been a planned economy subject to a system of macroeconomic management. Although the Chinese government still owns the majority of productive assets in China, economic reform policies since the late 1970s have emphasized decentralization, autonomous enterprises and the utilization of market mechanisms. Because many reforms are unprecedented or experimental, they are expected to be refined and improved. Other political, economic and social factors, such as political changes, changes in the rates of economic growth, unemployment or inflation, or in the disparities in per capita wealth between regions within China, could lead to further readjustment of the reform measures. This refining and readjustment process may negatively affect our operations.\nIf the PRC imposes restrictions to reduce inflation, future economic growth in the PRC could be severely affected.\nChina\u2019s economy registered a high rate of growth in the decade ending in 2010. Even though the growth rate began to slow starting in 2011, it has continued to grow at a rate in the high single digits since 2011. However, China\u2019s growth rate has not been evenly spread among all sectors of the economy, nor have all geographical regions of the country experienced the same levels of growth. Furthermore, the type of rapid growth that China is currently experiencing is often related to an increased risk of inflation. If the need arises to control inflation, the Chinese government may take similar measures as it has done in the past, including restrictions on the availability of domestic credit, reductions of the purchasing capability of certain of our customers, and limited re-centralization of the approval process for purchases of some foreign products. If similar restrictions are imposed, it may lead to a slowing of economic growth and reduce credit to finance the purchase of vehicles.\nThe PRC government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities.\nThe PRC government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, land use rights, property and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations.\nAccordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties or joint ventures.\nThe recent nature and uncertain application of many PRC laws applicable to us create an uncertain environment for business operations and they could have a negative effect on us.\nThe PRC legal system is a civil law system. Unlike the common law system, the civil law system is based on written statutes in which decided legal cases have little value as precedent. Furthermore, although China has made considerable progress in introducing new laws and regulations concerning foreign investment, corporate organization and governance, commerce and trade and taxation, these laws and regulations are relatively new, and the interpretation and enforcement of these laws involve significant uncertainties. Furthermore, the promulgation of new laws, changes of existing laws and the abrogation of local regulations by national laws could have a negative impact on our business and business prospects. In addition, as these laws, regulations and legal requirements are relatively recent, their interpretation and enforcement involve significant uncertainty.\nOur revenue and net income (loss) may be materially and adversely affected by any economic slowdown in China as well as globally.\nThe success of our business ultimately depends on consumer spending. We derive substantially all of our revenue from China. As a result, our revenue and net income are impacted to a significant extent by economic conditions in China and globally. The global economy, markets and levels of consumer spending are influenced by many factors beyond our control, including consumer perception of current and future economic conditions, political uncertainty, levels of employment, inflation or deflation, real disposable income, interest rates, taxation and currency exchange rates.\nThe PRC government has in recent years implemented a number of measures to control the rate of economic growth, including by raising interest rates and adjusting deposit reserve ratios for commercial banks as well as by implementing other measures designed to tighten credit and liquidity. These measures have contributed to a slowdown of the PRC economy. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, China's GDP growth rate was 6.9% in 2015, a decline of 50 basis points from 7.4% in 2014. Any continuing or worsening slowdown could significantly reduce domestic commerce in China, including the spending on luxury automobiles. An economic downturn, whether actual or perceived, a further decrease in economic growth rates or an otherwise uncertain economic outlook in China or any other market in which we may operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrency conversion and exchange rate volatility could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe PRC government imposes control over the conversion of Renminbi (\u201cRMB\u201d) into foreign currencies. Under the current unified floating exchange rate system, the People\u2019s Bank of China publishes an exchange rate (the \u201cPBOC exchange rate\u201d), based on the previous day\u2019s dealings in the inter-bank foreign exchange market. Financial institutions authorized to deal in foreign currency may enter into foreign exchange transactions at exchange rates within an authorized range above or below the PBOC exchange rate according to market conditions.\nEnterprises in the PRC that require foreign exchange for transactions relating to current account items, may, without approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (\u201cSAFE\u201d), effect payment from their foreign exchange account or convert and pay at the designated foreign exchange banks by providing valid receipts and proofs.\nConvertibility of foreign exchange in respect of capital account items, such as direct investment and capital contribution, is still subject to certain restrictions, and prior approval from the SAFE or its relevant branches must be sought.\nThe value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions and the foreign exchange policy adopted by the PRC government. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its policy of pegging the value of the RMB to the U.S. dollar. Following the removal of the U.S. dollar peg, the RMB appreciated more than 20% against the U.S. dollar over the following three years. Between July 2008 and June 2010, this appreciation halted and the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar remained within a narrow band. Since June 2010, the PRC government has allowed the RMB to appreciate slowly against the U.S. dollar again, and it has appreciated more than 10% since June 2010. In April 2012, the PRC government announced that it would allow more RMB exchange rate fluctuation. On August 11, 2015, the PRC government set the central parity rate for the RMB nearly 2% lower than that of the previous day and announced that it will begin taking into account previous day's trading in setting the central parity rate. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the RMB devalued over 5.5% against the U.S. dollars. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar in the future. There remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a more flexible currency policy, which could result in greater fluctuation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. As substantially all of our financial assets and operations are located in China and are denominated in RMB, any significant revaluation of the RMB may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenues and financial condition. For example, to the extent that we need to convert United States dollars into RMB for our operations, appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the RMB amount we would receive. Conversely, if we decide to convert RMB into the U.S. dollar for other business purposes and the U.S. dollar appreciates against the RMB, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the RMB we convert would be reduced.\nLaws and regulations applicable to the Internet in China remain unsettled and could have a material adverse effect on Internet\u2019s growth and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGrowth of the Internet in China could be materially and adversely affected by governmental regulation of the industry. Due to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet and other online services, it is possible that regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet or other services covering issues such as user privacy, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, antitrust and characteristics and quality of products and services. Furthermore, the growth and development of the market for electronic commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online. The adoption of additional laws or regulations may slow the growth of the Internet or other services, which could in turn lead to reduced Internet traffic and increase our cost of doing business. While we are not aware of any existing or proposed regulations that have a significant direct adverse effect on our business, a restrictive regulatory policy regarding the Chinese Internet industry would have a material adverse effect on us by slowing the industry\u2019s growth in China.\nWe may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions in China based on United States or other foreign laws against us.\nWe conduct our operations in China and all of our assets are located in China. In addition, most of our directors and executive officers reside within China, and substantially all of the assets of these persons are located within China. As a result, it may not be possible to effect service of process within the United States or elsewhere outside China upon those directors or executive officers, including with respect to matters arising under US federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws. Moreover, our Chinese counsel has advised us that China does not have treaties with the US and many other countries that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgment of courts. As a result, recognition and enforcement in China of judgments of a court of the US or any other jurisdiction in relation to any matter may be difficult or impossible.\nRestrictions on paying dividends or making other payments to us bind our subsidiaries in China.\nWe are a holding company and do not have any assets or conduct any business operations in China other than our investments in our subsidiaries in China. As a result, our ability to pay dividends and to finance any debt we may incur depends upon dividends paid by our PRC subsidiaries. If our PRC subsidiaries or any newly formed subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing their debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends to us. In addition, our PRC subsidiaries are permitted to pay dividends to us only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Under PRC laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiaries are required to allocate at least 10% of their after-tax profits each year, if any, to PRC statutory reserves before distributing dividends until the balance of such fund has reached 50% of its registered capital. Our PRC subsidiaries with foreign investment are also required to further set aside a portion of its after-tax profits to fund the employee welfare fund at the discretion of the board. Although PRC statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of our PRC subsidiaries, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation of any of our PRC subsidiaries.\nThe Chinese government also imposes controls on the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. We may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency. If we or any of our subsidiaries are unable to receive all of the revenues from our operations through these arrangements, we may be unable to effectively finance our operations or pay dividends on our common stock.\nOur significant amount of deposits in certain banks in China may be at risk if these banks go bankrupt during our deposit period, and the risk of bankruptcy of the banks with which we have lines of credit may adversely affect our ability to provide financial services to our customers.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $7.1 million of cash deposited in banks, such as time deposits and bank notes, and $23.8 million of restricted cash, which constitute substantially all of our total cash and cash equivalents (both unrestricted and restricted) as of December 31, 2015. The terms of these deposits are, in general, up to twelve months. Historically, deposits in Chinese banks are secure due to the state policy on protecting depositors\u2019 interests. However, China promulgated a new Bankruptcy Law in August 2006, which came into effect on June 1, 2007, and which contains a separate article expressly stating that the State Council may promulgate implementation measures for the bankruptcy of Chinese banks based on the Bankruptcy Law. Under the new Bankruptcy Law, a Chinese bank may go bankrupt. In addition, since China\u2019s accession to the WTO, foreign banks have been gradually permitted to operate in China and have been competitors against Chinese banks in many aspects, especially since the opening of Chinese business to foreign banks in late 2006. Therefore, the risk of bankruptcy of those banks in which we have deposits has increased. In the event of bankruptcy of one of the banks which holds our deposits, we are unlikely to claim our deposits back in full since we are unlikely to be classified as a secured creditor based on PRC laws. In the event that one or more of our banks files for bankruptcy protection, our ability to offer Financing Services to our customers may be materially and adversely impacted, thereby having a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nPRC regulations relating to acquisitions of PRC companies by foreign entities may create regulatory uncertainties that could restrict or limit our ability to operate\nOn August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies namely, the PRC Ministry of Commerce, the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (\u201cSASAC\u201d), the State Administration for Taxation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (\u201cCSRC\u201d), and SAFE, jointly adopted the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (the \u201cM&A Rules\u201d), which became effective on September 8, 2006, as amended on June 22, 2009. The M&A Rules significantly revised China\u2019s regulatory framework governing onshore-to-offshore restructurings and foreign acquisitions of domestic enterprises. The M&A Rules signify greater PRC government attention to cross-border merger, acquisition and other investment activities, by confirming MOFCOM as a key regulator for issues related to mergers and acquisitions in China and requiring MOFCOM approval of a broad range of merger, acquisition and investment transactions. Further, the M&A Rules establish reporting requirements for acquisition of control by foreigners of companies in key industries, and reinforce the ability of the Chinese government to monitor and prohibit foreign control transactions in key industries. Among other things, the M&A Rules include new provisions that purport to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle, or SPV, formed for listing purposes and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals must obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such SPV\u2019s securities on an overseas stock exchange. However, the application of this PRC regulation remains unclear regarding the scope and applicability of the CSRC approval requirement.\nWe are committed to complying with and to ensuring that our beneficial owners who are subject to the M&A Rules will comply with the relevant rules. However, we cannot assure you that all of our current or future beneficial owners who are PRC residents will comply with our request to make or obtain any applicable registrations or comply with these rules. Any failure by any of our current or future beneficial owners to comply with relevant requirements under this regulation could subject us to fines or sanctions imposed by the PRC government, including restrictions on our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends or make distributions to us and our ability to increase our investment in our PRC subsidiaries.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe market price for shares of our common stock could be volatile; the sale of material amounts of our common stock could reduce the price of our common stock and encourage short sales.\nThe market price for the shares of our common stock may fluctuate in response to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Such factors may include, without limitation, the general economic and monetary environment, quarter-to-quarter variations in our anticipated and actual operating results, future financing activities and the open-market trading of our shares in particular.\nFrom time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, a stockholder (or stockholders whose shares are aggregated) who has satisfied a six month holding period may, under certain circumstances, sell within any three-month period a number of securities which does not exceed the greater of 1% of the then outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume of the class during the four calendar weeks prior to such sale. Rule 144 also permits, under certain circumstances, the sale of securities, without any limitations, by a non-affiliate of our Company that has satisfied a one year holding period. Any substantial sale of common stock pursuant to Rule 144 may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOne stockholder exercises significant control over matters requiring stockholder approval.\nBright Praise Enterprises Limited has voting power equal to approximately 40.85% of our voting securities. As a result, Bright Praise Enterprises Limited, through such stock ownership, exercises significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership in Bright Praise Enterprises Limited may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us that may be otherwise viewed as beneficial by stockholders other than Bright Praise Enterprises Limited.\nIf we fail to develop or maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial statements, which would harm the trading price of our common stock.\nCompanies that file reports with the SEC, including us, are subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX 404. SOX 404 requires management to establish and maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting and annual reports on Form 10-K filed under the Exchange Act to contain a report from management assessing the effectiveness of a company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Separately, under SOX 404, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, public companies that are large accelerated or accelerated filers must include in their annual reports on Form 10-K an attestation report of their regular auditors attesting to and reporting on management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting. Non-accelerated filers and smaller reporting companies are not required to include an attestation report of their auditors in annual reports.\nA report of our management is included under Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this report. We are a smaller reporting company and, consequently, are not required to include an attestation report of our auditor in this annual report. However, if and when we become subject to the auditor attestation requirements under SOX 404, we can provide no assurance that we will receive an unqualified report from our independent auditors.\nDuring its evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, management identified a material weakness relating to our lack of sufficient accounting personnel with an appropriate understanding of US GAAP and SEC reporting requirements.\nWe are undertaking remedial measures, which measures will take time to implement and test, to address this material weakness. There can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to remedy the material weakness identified or that additional material weaknesses or other control or significant deficiencies will not be identified in the future. If we continue to experience material weaknesses in our internal controls or fail to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, such circumstances could cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements, or adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and, if required, annual auditor attestation reports. Each of the foregoing results could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and lead to a decline in our stock price. See Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d for more information.\nWe do not foresee paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our stock, and we do not plan to pay cash dividends on our stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe may be required to raise additional financing by issuing new securities with terms or rights superior to those of our shares of common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our shares of common stock.\nWe may require additional financing to fund future operations, including expansion in current and new markets, programming development and acquisition, capital costs and the costs of any necessary implementation of technological innovations or alternative technologies. We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, the percentage ownership of our current stockholders will be reduced, and the holders of the new equity securities may have rights superior to those of the holders of shares of our common stock, which could adversely affect the market price and the voting power of shares of our common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, the holders of these debt securities would similarly have some rights senior to those of the holders of shares of common stock, and the terms of these debt securities could impose restrictions on operations and create a significant interest expense for us.\nWe may have difficulty raising necessary capital to fund operations as a result of market price volatility for our shares of common stock.\nIn recent years, the securities markets in the United States have experienced a high level of price and volume volatility, and the market price of securities of many companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have not necessarily been related to the operations, performances, underlying asset values or prospects of such companies. For these reasons, our shares of common stock can also be expected to be subject to volatility resulting from purely market forces over which we will have no control. If our business development plans are successful, we may require additional financing to continue to develop and exploit existing and new technologies and to expand into new markets. The exploitation of our technologies may, therefore, be dependent upon our ability to obtain financing through debt and equity or other means.\nWe are responsible for the indemnification of our officers and directors which could result in substantial expenditures, which we may be unable to recoup.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws provide for the indemnification of our directors and officers, under certain circumstances, against attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses incurred by them in any litigation to which they become a party arising from their association with or activities on behalf of us. This indemnification policy could result in substantial expenditures, which we may be unable to recoup.\nWe rely on our PRC subsidiaries for the distribution of any dividends to our shareholders.\nWe are a company incorporated in the United States and our cash flow depends on dividends from our PRC subsidiaries. In order for us to distribute any dividends to our shareholders, we will rely on dividends distributed by our PRC subsidiaries. PRC regulations currently permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Under current PRC laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiaries are required, where applicable, to allocate a portion of their net profits to PRC statutory reserves before distributing dividends, including at least 10% of their net profit to PRC statutory reserves until the balance of such fund has reached 50% of their registered capital. These reserves can only be used for specific purposes, including making-up cumulative losses of previous years, conversion to our equity capital, and application to business expansion, and are not distributable as dividends. Further, if our PRC subsidiaries incur debt in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. Our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 restricted net assets as of December 31, 2015 amounted to approximately $2,126,000.\nTechniques employed by short sellers may drive down the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is in the short seller\u2019s best interests for the price of the stock to decline, many short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a stock short. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market.\nPublic companies that have substantially all of their operations in China have been the subject of short selling. Much of the scrutiny and negative publicity has centered around allegations of a lack of effective internal control over financial reporting resulting in financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result, many of these companies are now conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations and, in the interim, are subject to shareholder lawsuits and/or SEC enforcement actions.\nIt is not clear what effect such negative publicity would have on the Company, if any. If the Company were to become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, the Company could have to expend a significant amount of resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend itself. While the Company would strongly defend against any such short seller attacks, the Company may be constrained in the manner in which it can proceed against the relevant short seller by principles of freedom of speech, applicable state law or issues of commercial confidentiality. Such a situation could be costly and time-consuming, and could distract the Company\u2019s management from growing the Company. Even if such allegations are ultimately proven to be groundless, allegations against the Company could severely impact its business operations and stockholders equity, and any investment in the Company\u2019s stock could be greatly reduced or rendered worthless.\nA DTC \u201cGlobal Lock\u201d on the electronic clearing of trades in our securities in the future may affect the liquidity of our stock and our ability to raise capital\nOn July 16, 2014, the Company received a letter from the Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d), notifying the Company of DTC\u2019s intention to suspend all book-entry services provided to its participants with respect to the common shares of the Company (a \u201cGlobal Lock\u201d). On October 13, 2014, the Company received notice from DTC that it was suspending the notice of Global Lock contained in this letter. DTC reserved its right to proceed with the institution of a Global Lock in the future, but noted that no Global Lock would be instituted without first providing to the Company notice and an opportunity to object. If a Global Lock were to be imposed, the Company\u2019s common shares would not be eligible for delivery, transfer or withdrawal through DTC until the Global Lock was removed, if ever.", "PERMNO": 92936, "SIC": 5010, "TIC": "CALI"}
