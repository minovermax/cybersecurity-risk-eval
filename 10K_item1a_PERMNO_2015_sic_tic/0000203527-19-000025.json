{"cik": "203527", "company": "VARIAN MEDICAL SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-11-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The occurrence of any of the following risks or of unknown risks and uncertainties may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESSES\nOur performance depends on successful improvements to our existing products and services, commercialization of new products and services and increasingly on our ability to anticipate emerging trends in oncology diagnosis, treatment and management.\nThe markets in which we operate are characterized by rapid change and technological innovation. Our performance depends on the successful commercialization of new products and services that reflect and respond to changes in the marketplace, technology and customer demands and increasingly on our ability to anticipate emerging trends in oncology diagnosis, treatment and management.\n\u2022\nOur Oncology Systems hardware and software products often have long development and government approval cycles, are technologically complex and must demonstrate high levels of performance and functionality to remain competitive.\n\u2022\nOur software products compete in markets characterized by rapid technological advances, changing delivery models, evolving standards and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. We are expanding our software product lines and investing in the development of cloud and software-as-a-service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) solutions. The development and introduction of new software platforms and delivery models, as well as different business models, is complex and involves many technological, regulatory and legal hurdles. We cannot assure you that we can successfully develop and implement such platforms or models or that our customers will accept them.\n\u2022\nOur Proton Solutions products require intensive planning, design, development, testing and capital commitment. Because of the large footprint and high price of many proton therapy systems, there is increasing demand for the development of smaller, more compact proton therapy systems. Although we have introduced our ProBeam\u00ae Compact single-room proton therapy solution and our ProBeam 360 single room and multi-room systems, other companies have more experience offering smaller, less expensive proton therapy systems. Our competitiveness will depend on our ability to continue to timely develop new technologies to reduce the size and price of our system or provide additional features and functionality that our competitors do not.\n\u2022\nOur Interventional Solutions business offers products for interventional oncology procedures and treatments, including cryoablation, microwave ablation and embolization The success of our Interventional Oncology business will depend on general market penetration and acceptance of interventional solutions among physicians, the medical community, healthcare payors and patients, and our ability to develop and successfully market technologically competitive products and win market share from other companies in spaces where they have greater resources than we do.\n\u2022\nIn addition to hardware and software products for oncology care, we offer treatment planning and quality assurance as a service, which allows remote delivery and support of care in understaffed locations to utilize technology on a per patient basis. Our ability to realize the full potential of these services will depend heavily on our ability to deploy them using AI-based software solutions and developing such software solutions.\nWe may need to spend more time and money than anticipated to develop and introduce new products, product enhancements or services. We may not be able to recover all or a meaningful part of our investments. New products may adversely impact orders and sales of our existing products or make them less desirable or even obsolete. In addition, certain costs, including installation and warranty costs, associated with new products may be disproportionately greater than the costs associated with existing products, and if we are unable to lower these costs over time, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to successfully develop and introduce new products, product enhancements and services depends, among other things, on our ability to:\n\u2022\nproperly identify and respond to customer needs;\n\u2022\ndemonstrate the value proposition of new products and services;\n\u2022\nlimit the time required from proof of feasibility to routine production;\n\u2022\ntimely and efficiently comply with internal quality assurance systems and processes;\n\u2022\nlimit the timing and cost of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\naccurately predict and control costs associated with inventory overruns or shortages caused by phase-in of new products and services and phase-out of old products and services;\n\u2022\nprice our products and services competitively and profitably;\n\u2022\nmanufacture, deliver and install our products in sufficient volumes on time, and accurately predict and control costs associated with manufacturing, installation, warranty and maintenance of the products; and\n\u2022\nmanage customer demands for new and old products and services, and optimize complementary product lines and services.\nWe cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully commercialize new products because commercialization involves compliance with complex quality assurance processes, including the Quality System Regulation (\u201cQSR\u201d) of the FDA. Failure to complete these processes on a timely and efficient basis could result in delays that could affect our ability to attract or retain customers, or could cause customers to delay or cancel orders.\nIn addition, a portion of our Oncology Systems\u2019 product revenue is generally tied to installation and acceptance of the product, and our recognition of revenue associated with new products may be deferred where it takes longer to manufacture or install the new products. Customers may also decide not to upgrade their equipment, or customers may delay delivery of some of our more sophisticated products because of the longer preparation and renovation of treatment rooms required.\nWe compete in highly competitive markets, and we may lose market share to companies with greater resources or more effective technologies, or be forced to reduce our prices.\nThe markets for cancer treatment are characterized by rapidly evolving technology, intense competition and pricing pressure. In radiotherapy and radiosurgery markets, we compete primarily with Elekta AB and Accuray Incorporated. In addition, our software products compete with the product offerings of a variety of companies, such as Philips Medical Systems, RaySearch Laboratories AB and Brainlab AG.\nNew competitors may enter our markets and have already entered some of our newer markets such as radiosurgery, VMAT and proton therapy. Established enterprise software developers with greater software development capability may enter the markets for cancer treatment software. Some of these competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources. To compete successfully, we must provide technically superior, proven products that deliver more precise, cost-effective, high quality clinical capabilities, in a complete package of products and services, and do so ahead of our competitors.\nAs our Oncology Systems products are generally sold on a basis of total value to the customer, our business may suffer when purchase decisions are based solely upon price, which can happen if hospitals and clinics give purchasing decision authority to group purchasing organizations. New competitors may also delay the purchasing decisions of customers if customers decide to evaluate the products of such competitors along with ours, potentially extending our sales cycle and adversely affecting our gross orders and revenues.\nThe shift in the proportion of sales outside the United States towards emerging market countries, which typically purchase less complex, lower-priced products compared to more developed countries, and which usually have stiffer price competition and longer periods from placement of orders to revenue recognition, could also adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe market for proton therapy products is still developing and is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and pricing pressure. Our primary competitors in the proton therapy market are Hitachi Heavy Industries, Ion Beam Applications S.A. and Mevion Medical Systems. Our ability to compete successfully depends, in part, on our ability to lower our product costs, and develop and provide technically superior, proven products that deliver precise, cost-effective, high quality capabilities.\nThe market for interventional solutions products is relatively new, still developing and is marked by a wide variety of products, many of which have had varying degrees of market acceptance. Our primary competitors in the interventional solutions market include Boston Scientific Corp., Terumo Medical Corp., Merit Medical Systems, AngioDynamics, Medtronic and Johnson & Johnson, many of which have greater experience in the interventional oncology market and more financial and other resources than we do.\nThe successful development of alternative therapies for cancer (e.g. pharmaceutical treatments such as immunotherapy), increased efficacy information about new therapies or existing products, pricing decisions by competitors and the rate of market penetration by competitive products may render our products obsolete, result in lost market share for us, reduce utilization of our products, lower prices, and reduce product sales and operating margins.\nThe timing of our competitors\u2019 introduction of products into the market could affect the market acceptance and market share of our products. Some competitors offer specialized products that provide, or may be perceived by customers to provide, a marketing advantage over our mainstream cancer treatment products. Also, some of our competitors may not be subject to the same standards, regulatory and/or other legal requirements that we are subject to, and therefore, they could have a competitive advantage in developing, manufacturing and marketing products and services. Any inability to develop, gain regulatory approval for and supply commercial quantities of competitive products to the market as quickly and effectively as our competitors could limit market acceptance of our products and reduce our sales. In addition, some of our smaller competitors could be acquired by larger companies that have greater financial strength and resources, which could enable them to compete more aggressively and effectively. Our competitors could also acquire some of our suppliers or distributors, which could disrupt supply or distribution arrangements and result in less predictable and reduced revenues in our businesses.\nThe interoperability of radiation oncology treatment products is becoming increasingly important, and sales of our products could fall if we fail to establish interoperability.\nAs radiation oncology treatment becomes more complex, our customers are increasingly focused on ease-of-use and interconnectivity. We have directed substantial product development efforts into (1) increasing the interconnectivity of our products for more seamless operation within a system, (2) making our software products easier to use and (3) reducing setup and treatment times to increase patient throughput. Our equipment and software are highly sophisticated, and a high level of training and education is required to use them safely and effectively.\nWe have emphasized an \u201copen systems\u201d approach that allows customers to \u201cmix and match\u201d our individual products, incorporate products from other manufacturers, share information with other systems or products and offer various methods of radiation and chemotherapy treatment. We have done this based on our belief that such interconnectivity will increase the acceptance and adoption of IMRT, IGRT and VMAT and will stimulate demand for our products. There are competitive \u201cclosed-ended\u201d dedicated-use systems that place simplicity of use ahead of flexibility. If we have misjudged the importance to our customers of maintaining an \u201copen systems\u201d approach, or if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to increase interconnectivity, enhance ease-of-use and reduce setup and treatment times, our revenues could suffer. Obtaining and maintaining interoperability and compatibility can be costly and time-consuming. While we try to use standard published protocols for communication with widely-used oncology products manufactured by other companies, if we cannot do this, we may need to develop individual interfaces so that our products communicate correctly with other products.\nWhen other companies modify the design or functionality of their products, this may affect their compatibility with our products. In addition, when we improve our products, customers may be reluctant to adopt our new technology due to potential interoperability issues. For example, a clinic may be unwilling to implement one of our new technologies because its third-party software does not yet communicate correctly with our new product. Our ability to obtain compatibility with products of other companies may depend on our ability to obtain adequate information from them regarding their products. In many cases, these third parties are our competitors and may schedule their product changes or delay their release of relevant information to place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nWhen we modify our products to make them interoperable or compatible with third-party products, we may be required to obtain additional regulatory clearances. This process is costly and could delay our ability to release our products for commercial use. It is also possible that, despite our efforts, we may not be able to make our products interoperable or compatible with widely used third-party products or may only be able to do so at a prohibitive expense, making our products less attractive to our customers.\nDisruption of our critical information systems or material cyberattacks or security breaches of our products may adversely affect our business and customer relations.\nInformation technology helps us operate efficiently, interface with and support our customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, and produce our financial statements. There is an increasing threat of information security attacks for companies such as Varian. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to, among other things, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through a security breach. Such security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of information, litigation and possible liability to employees, customers and regulatory authorities. If our data management systems fail to effectively collect, secure, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired. Any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and the timeliness with which we report our operating results internally and externally.\nWe manufacture and sell (i) hardware products that rely upon software systems to operate properly and (ii) software products that deliver treatment instructions and store confidential patient information. Both types of products often are connected to and reside within our customers' information technology infrastructures. While we have implemented security measures to protect our hardware and software products from unauthorized access, these measures may not be effective in securing these products, particularly since techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. Additionally, we are developing and offering cloud and SaaS software products which reside with and are hosted by third-party providers. A security breach, whether of our products, of our customers\u2019 network security and systems or of third-party hosting services, could disrupt treatments occurring on our products, disrupt access to our customers' stored information, such as patient treatment delivery instructions, and could lead to the loss of, damage to or public disclosure of our customers\u2019 stored information, including patient health information. Such an event could have serious negative consequences, including possible patient injury, regulatory action, fines, penalties and damages, reduced demand for our solutions, an unwillingness of our customers to use our solutions, harm to our reputation and brand, and time-consuming and expensive litigation, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nIf we were to experience a significant cyberattack or security breach of our information systems or data, the costs associated with the investigation, remediation and potential notification of the breach to customers and counter-parties could be material.\nWe carry a limited amount of insurance for cybersecurity liability, and our insurance coverage may be inadequate. In the future, our insurance coverage may be expensive and/or not be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts, if at all.\nWe may offer extended payment terms to certain customers, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe offer extended payment terms for certain qualified customers. As of September 27, 2019, customer contracts with remaining terms of more than one year amounted to approximately 4% of our net trade and unbilled receivables.\nWhile we qualify customers to whom we offer extended payment terms, their financial positions may change adversely over the longer payment term. Many of the customers to which we offer such extended payment terms are located in underdeveloped legal systems for securing debt and enforcing collection of debt. Concerns over economic instability could also make it more difficult for us to collect outstanding receivables. This may result in an increase in payment defaults and uncollectible accounts, or could cause us to increase our bad debt expense, which would adversely affect our net earnings. In addition, extended payment terms decrease our cash flow from operations.\nIn addition to extended payment terms, in some cases the purchase price for our hardware products is also variable based on the number of patients treated with the product, which may make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue.\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our sales or make them less predictable.\nRevenues outside of the United States accounted for approximately 57%, 55%, and 53% of our total revenues during fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Correspondingly, we must provide significant service and support globally. We intend to continue to expand our presence in international markets and expect to expend significant resources in doing so. We cannot assure you that we will be able to recover these investments in international markets.\nOur results of operation could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nlower sales prices and gross margins usually associated with sales of our products and services in international regions, and in emerging markets in particular;\n\u2022\nthe longer payment cycles associated with many foreign customers;\n\u2022\nthe typically longer periods from placement of orders to revenue recognition in certain international and emerging markets;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in interpreting or enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through the legal systems of many foreign countries;\n\u2022\nunstable regional political and economic conditions or changes in restrictions on trade between the United States and other countries;\n\u2022\nchanges in the political, regulatory, safety or economic conditions in a country or region, including as a result of the pending United Kingdom (the \u201cU.K.\u201d) exit from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) (\u201cBrexit\u201d);\n\u2022\nthe imposition by governments, including the United States, of additional taxes, tariffs, global economic sanctions programs or other restrictions on foreign trade;\n\u2022\nany inability to obtain required export or import licenses or approvals;\n\u2022\nany inability to comply with export or import laws and requirements or any violation of sanctions regulations, which may result in enforcement actions, civil or criminal penalties and restrictions on exportation;\n\u2022\nany increase in the cost of trade compliance functions to comply with changes to regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain proper business licenses or other documentation, or to otherwise comply with local laws and requirements to conduct business in a foreign jurisdiction; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility that it may be more difficult to protect our intellectual property in foreign countries.\nTariffs or cross-border trade restrictions could increase the cost of our products.\nBetween July 2018 and May 2019, the Trump Administration imposed a series of tariffs, ranging from 5% to 25%, on numerous products imported into the United States from China, including Varian\u2019s radiotherapy systems manufactured in China and certain components used in our manufacturing and service activities. In July and August of 2018, China retaliated against the U.S. tariffs by imposing its own series of tariffs, ranging from 10% to 25%, on certain products imported into China from the United States, including Varian\u2019s radiotherapy systems and certain manufacturing and service components.\nWe participated in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (\u201cUSTR\u201d) process to seek product-specific exclusions from the U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. To date, USTR has granted tariff exclusions for four products: certain radiotherapy systems manufactured in China, as well as three key components of the radiation therapy systems that we manufacture in the United States: multi-leaf collimators, certain printed circuit board assemblies and tungsten shielding. We submitted an additional U.S. exclusion request in September 2019, in relation to a manufacturing component, which request is pending.\nIn June and July 2019, Varian submitted formal requests to the Chinese government for exclusions from the Chinese retaliatory tariffs for manufacturing inputs, service parts and radiotherapy systems imported into China from the United States. In September 2019, the Chinese government granted a tariff exclusion for medical linear accelerators, including our radiotherapy systems. The other exclusion requests are still pending.\nThe U.S. and Chinese government tariff exclusions have retroactive effect and are valid for one-year periods, with anticipated renewal processes.\nThese tariffs and any additional tariffs or tariff increases imposed by the United States or China that apply to our systems or component parts could increase the costs of our products and adversely impact the competitiveness of our products and/or our operational results in the future. In addition, while to date several of our exclusion requests to USTR and China have been successful, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional tariff exclusion requests or that any existing tariff exclusions that have been granted will be renewed. In addition, while we believe we are eligible for refunds for tariffs that have been levied following the grant of the tariff exclusions, there can be no assurance that we will ultimately receive such refunds, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates may impact our results.\nBecause our business is global, and payments are generally made in local currency, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can impact our results by affecting product demand, or our revenues and expenses, and/or the profitability in U.S. Dollars of products and services that we sell in foreign markets.\nWhile we use hedging strategies to help offset the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the protection these strategies provide is affected by the timing of transactions, the effectiveness of the hedges, the number of transactions that are hedged and forecast accuracy. If our hedging strategies do not offset these fluctuations, our revenues, margins and other operating results may be adversely impacted. Furthermore, movements in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial results positively or negatively in one period and not in another, making it more difficult to compare our financial results from period to period.\nIn addition, our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis, typically up to the next twelve-month period. Therefore, we are exposed to currency fluctuations over a longer term. Long-term movements in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect the competitiveness of our products in the local currencies of our international customers. A substantial portion of our international sales are priced in local currencies, although our cost structure is weighted towards the U.S. Dollar. Therefore, the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar may adversely affect our competitiveness and financial results, as our foreign competitors may have cost structures based in other currencies and they may be more competitive when the U.S. Dollar strengthens against those currencies.\nChanges in monetary or other policies here and abroad, including as a result of economic and or political instability, or in reaction thereto, would also likely affect foreign currency exchange rates. Furthermore, if one or more European countries were to replace the Euro with another currency, our sales into these countries, or into Europe generally, would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established.\nUnfavorable results of legal proceedings could adversely affect our financial results.\nFrom time to time, we are a party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings, claims and government inspections or investigations and other legal matters, both inside and outside the United States, including product liability claims and intellectual property claims. For example, in October 2018, Best Medical International, Inc. (\"Best Medical\") filed a complaint for patent infringement against us in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that several of our products infringe several of Best Medical's patents. Based on currently available information, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of loss or range of losses, if any, arising from this matter. Legal proceedings are often lengthy, taking place over a period of years before the outcome is final. Litigation is subject to significant uncertainty and may be expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.\nIf a legal proceeding were finally resolved against us, it could result in significant compensatory damages, and in certain circumstances punitive or trebled damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief imposed on us. If our existing insurance does not cover the amount or types of damages awarded, or if other resolution or actions taken as a result of the legal proceeding were to restrain our ability to market one or more of our material products or services, our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, legal proceedings, and any adverse resolution thereof, can result in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact our business.\nConsolidation among our oncology systems customers could adversely affect our sales of oncology products.\nWe have seen and may continue to see some consolidation among our customers in our Oncology Systems business, as hospitals and clinics combine through mergers and acquisitions, and as they join group purchasing organizations or affiliated enterprises. In addition, we have seen and may continue to see integration of equipment and information systems among hospitals as they consolidate their networks. As customers consolidate and/or integrate, the volume of product sales to these customers might decrease. Alternatively, order size may increase, as customers combine orders as one entity, or as groups of organizations combine their purchases. If orders increase in size and require more customer approvals, the purchasing cycle for our Oncology Systems products could lengthen. Both increased order size and extended purchasing cycles could cause our gross orders to be more volatile and less predictable and could result in longer overall order to revenue cycles. In addition, some customers appear to be developing new partnerships across clinical specialties to prepare for the possibility of operating in an accountable care organization (\u201cACO\u201d) environment and the possibility of bundled reimbursement payments. Group purchasing organizations often focus on pricing as the determinant in making purchase decisions. A reduction in pricing could negatively impact gross orders, future revenues and gross margins.\nOur business will suffer if we are unable to provide the significant education and training required for the healthcare market to accept our products.\nIn order to achieve market acceptance for our radiation therapy products, we often need to (i) educate physicians about the use of treatment procedures such as IMRT, IGRT, VMAT, SRS, SBRT, proton therapy or procedures using our interventional oncology products, (ii) overcome physician objections to some of the effects of the product or its related treatment regimen, (iii) convince healthcare payors that the benefits of the product and its related treatment process outweigh its costs, and (iv) help train qualified physicists in the skilled use of the product. For example, the complex and dynamic nature of IMRT and IGRT requires significant education of hospital personnel and physicians regarding the benefits of and practices associated with IMRT and IGRT. Further, the complexity and high cost of proton therapy requires similar significant education, as well as education regarding construction and facility requirements. We have devoted and will continue to devote significant resources to marketing and educational efforts to (a) create awareness of IMRT, IGRT, VMAT radiotherapy, SRS, SBRT, proton therapy or procedures using our interventional oncology products, (b) encourage the acceptance and adoption of our products for these technologies and (c) promote the safe and effective use of our products in compliance with their operating procedures. Future products may not gain adequate market acceptance among physicians, patients and healthcare payors, even if we spend significant time and expense educating them about these products.\nOur business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain qualified personnel.\nOur future success depends, to a great degree, on our ability to retain, attract, expand, integrate and train our management team and other key personnel, such as qualified engineering, service, sales, marketing and other staff. We compete for key personnel with other medical equipment and software manufacturers, as well as universities and research institutions. As we continue to grow our software revenues, we face intense competition for personnel from software and technology companies. Because this competition is intense, compensation-related costs could increase significantly if the supply of qualified personnel decreases or demand increases. If we are unable to hire and train qualified personnel, we may not be able to maintain or expand our\nbusiness. In addition, some of our executive officers have had long careers at our company. If these executives retire or leave, and we are unable to locate qualified or suitable replacements in a timely manner, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe may not realize expected benefits from acquisitions of or investments in businesses, products or technologies, which could harm our business.\nWe need to grow and evolve our businesses in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. From time to time we may decide to execute on our strategy of becoming the global leader in multi-disciplinary, integrated cancer care solutions through the acquisition of, or investments in, businesses, products or technologies, rather than through organic development. For example, we completed five acquisitions in fiscal year 2019. Identifying suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to identify suitable candidates or successfully complete identified acquisitions. In addition, negotiating and completing an acquisition can divert our management and key personnel from our current business operations, which could harm our business and adversely affect our financial results.\nThere can be no assurance that the businesses, products or technologies we acquire, or the businesses we invest in, will become profitable or remain so. It may cost us more than anticipated to commercialize acquired business product lines, as we experienced with our proton therapy systems, or require us to increase our research and development, sales and marketing or general and administrative expenses, any of which could adversely impact our results of operations. Moreover, our failure to successfully manage the growth of an acquired businesses could have an adverse impact on the overall financial performance of our business.\nFactors that will affect the success of our acquisitions include:\n\u2022\nour ability to retain key employees of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nthe performance of the acquired businesses and their technologies, products or services;\n\u2022\nour ability to integrate the operations, financial and other systems of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the combined company to achieve synergies such as increasing sales of the combined company\u2019s products and services, achieving expected cost savings and effectively combining technologies to develop new products and services;\n\u2022\nany disruption in order fulfillment or loss of sales due to integration processes;\n\u2022\nincreases in our risk of litigation, as a third-party may be more likely to assert a legal claim following an acquisition because of perceived deeper pockets or perceived greater value of a claim;\n\u2022\nthe absence of adequate internal controls and/or the presence of fraud in the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain or grow the acquired company\u2019s customers, suppliers, distributors or other partners;\n\u2022\nany decrease in customer and distributor loyalty and product orders caused by dissatisfaction with the product lines and sales and marketing practices of the acquired businesses, including price increases; and\n\u2022\nour assumption of known contingent liabilities, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, or unknown liabilities that come to light, in each case to the extent that the realization of such liabilities increases our expenses or adversely affects our business or financial position.\nWhen we acquire a business, we allocate the total purchase price to the acquired businesses\u2019 tangible assets and liabilities, identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based on their fair values as of the date of the acquisition, and we record the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. If we fail to achieve the anticipated growth or cash flows from an acquisition, or if we decide to sell assets or a business, we may be required to recognize an impairment loss on the write down of our assets and goodwill, which could adversely affect our financial results. In addition, from time to time we structure our acquisitions to include earnout provisions that require us to pay the sellers of the businesses we acquire additional cash payments upon the accomplishment of financial performance or developmental milestones in the periods following the acquisition closing date. Any changes to our estimate of the expected earnout payments after the close of the acquisition up to and including the final payment, would generally be reflected on our statement of earnings. Moreover, acquisitions can result in\npotentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or expenses, or other charges, any of which could harm our business and affect our financial results.\nAdditionally, we have investments in privately held companies. These investments are inherently risky, in some instances because the markets for the technologies or products these companies have under development may never materialize or achieve expectations. If these companies do not succeed, we may be forced to record impairment charges and could lose some or all of our investment in these companies.\nOur efforts to integrate acquired businesses may not be successful, and this may adversely affect our financial results.\nThe success of business acquisitions may depend on our ability to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business. Integrating the operations of acquired businesses requires significant efforts, including the coordination of operations, manufacturing, personnel, information technologies, research and development, sales and marketing and finance. These efforts can be compounded when the acquisitions are in new geographies or business lines. If these integration efforts are not successful, the anticipated benefits and synergies of the acquisition may not be realized fully, may take longer to realize than expected, or may not be realized at all. Our efforts to successfully integrate acquisitions may also result in additional expenses and divert significant amounts of management\u2019s time from other projects.\nAcquiring or implementing new business lines or offering new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may acquire or implement new business lines or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. For example, with our June 2019 acquisition of Cancer Treatment International (\u201cCTSI\u201d), we entered the healthcare provider space and plan to expand into treatment planning and service, and with our July and August 2019 acquisitions of Endocare and Alicon we entered the Interventional Oncology market. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts. We may invest significant time and resources in developing, marketing, or acquiring new lines of business and/or offering new products and services. Initial timetables for the introduction and development or acquisition of new lines of business and/or the offering of new products or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may prove to be unachievable. Our lack of experience or knowledge, as well as external factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the success of an acquisition or the implementation or of a new line of business or a new product or service. Entry into a new line of business and/or offering a new product or service may also subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar and may lead to increased litigation or regulatory risk. Furthermore, any new business line and/or new product or service could have an adverse impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. New business lines or new products and services within existing lines of business could affect the sales and profitability of existing lines of business or products and services, including as a result of sales channel conflicts. Other risks include: (i) potential diversion of management\u2019s attention, available cash, and other resources from our existing businesses; (ii) unanticipated liabilities or contingencies; (iii) the need for additional capital and other resources to expand into or acquire the new line of business; (iv) potential damage to existing customer relationships, lack of customer acceptance or inability to attract new customers; and (v) the inability to compete effectively. These risks would be magnified to the extent that any new business line would result in a significant increase in operations in developing markets. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the implementation or acquisition of new lines of business or the offering of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nLosing distributors may harm our revenues in some territories.\nWe have strategic relationships with a number of key distributors for sales and service of our products. If these strategic relationships end and are not replaced, our revenues from product sales or the ability to service our products in the territories serviced by these distributors could be adversely affected.\nThe results of studies and clinical trials are highly uncertain.\nWe have in the past conducted, and, in the future may continue to conduct, clinical trials related to prospective new therapies and technologies, including most recently pre-clinical studies in relation to ultra-high dose rate cancer treatments using our ProBeam platform. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of product candidates or new therapies and technologies may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials, and favorable data from interim analyses do not ensure that the final results of a trial will be favorable. Product candidates or new therapies and technologies may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials, or despite having produced favorable data in connection with an interim analysis. A number of companies in our industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising\nresults in earlier trials. In addition, even if such clinical trials are successfully completed, we cannot guarantee that the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities will interpret the results as we do, and more trials could be required before we submit our product candidates, new therapies or technologies for approval. To the extent that the results of trials are not satisfactory to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for support of a marketing application or desired reimbursement classification product codes, we may be required to expend significant resources, which may not be available to us, to conduct additional trials in support of potential approval of our product candidates, new therapies or technologies.\nOur credit facility restricts certain activities, and failure to comply with this agreement may adversely affect our business, liquidity and financial position.\nWe maintain a credit facility that contains affirmative and negative covenants that could restrict our operating and financing activities. These provisions limit our ability to, among other things, incur future indebtedness, contingent obligations or liens, guarantee indebtedness, make certain investments and capital expenditures, sell stock or assets and pay dividends, and consummate certain mergers or acquisitions. Because of the restrictions on our ability to create or assume liens, we may find it difficult to secure additional indebtedness if required.\nWe have in the past used borrowings under our credit facility to fund the repurchase of our shares, and we may continue to do so in the future. Furthermore, if we fail to comply with the credit facility requirements, we may be in default. Upon an event of default, if the credit agreement is not amended or the event of default is not waived, the lender could declare all amounts outstanding, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this happens, we may not be able to make those payments or borrow sufficient funds from alternative sources to make those payments. Even if we were to obtain additional financing, that financing may be on unfavorable terms.\nChanges in the interpretation or application of generally accepted accounting principles may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe prepare our financial statements to conform to GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various other regulatory or accounting bodies. A change in interpretations of, or our application of, these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced. In addition, when we are required to adopt new accounting standards, our methods of accounting for certain items may change, which could cause our results of operations to fluctuate each period. We may introduce new products or new technologies that require us to apply different accounting principles than we have applied in past periods, including accounting principles regarding revenue recognition. The application of different types of accounting principles and related potential changes may also make it more difficult to compare our financial results to prior periods, and the trading price of VMS common stock could suffer or become more volatile.\nOur operations are vulnerable to interruption or loss due to natural or other disasters, power loss, strikes and other events beyond our control.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our activities, including manufacturing, administration and data processing at facilities located in the State of California and other seismically active areas that have experienced major earthquakes and other natural disasters. We carry limited earthquake insurance that may not be adequate or continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms. In addition, we have operations in parts of the world, including cancer centers in parts of India, which have experienced natural disasters such as tsunamis, floods and drought. A major earthquake or other disaster (such as a major fire, hurricane, flood, drought, tsunami, volcanic eruption or terrorist attack) affecting our facilities, or those of our suppliers, could significantly disrupt our operations, and delay or prevent product manufacture and shipment during the time required to repair, rebuild or replace the damaged facilities. These delays could be lengthy and costly. If any of our customers\u2019 facilities are adversely affected by a disaster, shipments of our products could be delayed. Additionally, customers may delay purchases of our products until operations return to normal or may move to a competitor that can meet their desired delivery time frame. In addition, our facilities may be subject to a shortage of available electrical power and other energy supplies. Any shortages may increase our costs for power and energy supplies or could result in blackouts, which could disrupt the operations of our affected facilities and harm our business. Further, our products are typically shipped from a limited number of ports, and any disaster, strike or other event blocking shipment from these ports could delay or prevent shipments and harm our business. In addition, concerns about terrorism, the effects of a terrorist attack, political turmoil or an outbreak of epidemic diseases could have a negative effect on our business operations, those of our suppliers and customers, and the ability to travel, resulting in adverse consequences on our revenues and financial performance.\nThe decision by British voters to exit the E.U. may negatively impact our operations.\nIn June 2016, a majority of voters in the U.K. elected to withdraw from the E.U. (often referred to as Brexit) in a national referendum. On October 17, 2019, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the E.U. agreed to new terms for the country\u2019s exit from the E.U., which must be approved by the British Parliament. As of the date of this filing, the British Parliament has not agreed upon the terms of the withdrawal, which was extended until January 31, 2020. The referendum and ongoing negotiations have created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U.\nIf the U.K. leaves the E.U. with no agreement, it will likely have an adverse impact on labor and trade and will create further short-term currency volatility. In the absence of a future trade deal, the U.K.\u2019s trade with the European Union and the rest of the world would be subject to tariffs and duties set by the World Trade Organization, which could result in higher importation costs for our products. In addition, the movement of goods between the U.K. and the remaining member states of the E.U. will be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks, leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure. Moreover, currency volatility could drive a weaker British pound, which could result in a decrease in the profitability of our U.K. operations. Any adjustments we make to our business and operations as a result of Brexit could result in significant expense and take significant time to complete.\nWhile we have not experienced any material financial impact from Brexit on our U.K. business to date, sales into the U.K. represented approximately 3% of our total revenues in fiscal year 2019, and we cannot predict its future implications. Any impact from Brexit on our business and operations over the long term will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, tax treaties, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations the U.K. conducts.\nWe work in international locations with high security risks, which could result in harm to our employees or contractors or cause us to incur substantial costs.\nWe work in some international locations where there are high security risks, which could result in harm to our employees and contractors or substantial costs to maintain the safety of our personnel. Some of our services are performed in high-risk locations or adjacent locations where the country or surrounding area is suffering from political, social, or economic issues, war or civil unrest, or is experiencing a high level of criminal or terrorist activity. Despite the precautions that we take, the safety of our personnel in these locations may continue to be at risk, and we may in the future suffer the loss of employees and contractors, which could harm our business and operating results.\nProduct defects or misuse may result in material product liability or professional errors and omissions claims, litigation, investigation by regulatory authorities or product recalls that could harm our future financial results.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacture, sale, installation, servicing and support of medical devices and other devices that deliver radiation. Because our products are involved in the intentional delivery of radiation to the human body and other situations where people may come into contact with radiation, the possibility for significant injury and/or death exists. Our products operate within our customers\u2019 facilities and network systems, and under quality assurance procedures established by the facility that ultimately delivers radiation to patients. Human and other errors or accidents may arise from the operation of our products in complex environments, particularly with products from other vendors, where interoperability or data sharing protocol may not be optimized even though the equipment or system operates according to specifications. In addition, if the integrity of a catheter used as part of our cryoablation system is compromised, serious injury or death may occur. As a result, we may face substantial liability to patients, our customers and others for damages resulting from the faulty, or allegedly faulty, design, manufacture, installation, servicing, support, testing or interoperability of our products with other products, or their misuse or failure. In addition, third-party service providers could fail to adequately perform their obligations, which could subject us to further liability. We may also be subject to claims for property damages or economic loss related to or resulting from any errors or defects in our products, or the installation, servicing and support of our products. Any accident or mistreatment could subject us to legal costs, litigation, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation, whether or not our products or services were a factor. In connection with our products that collect and store patient treatment data, we may be liable for the loss or misuse of such private data or personal information, if those products fail or are otherwise defective.\nProduct liability actions are subject to significant uncertainty and may be expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. If a product liability action were determined against us, it could result in significant damages, including punitive damages, and our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nAdverse publicity regarding any accidents or mistreatments could cause patients to be less receptive to radiotherapy or radiosurgery treatments, to question the efficacy of radiation therapy and radiosurgery and to seek other methods of treatment.\nAdverse publicity could also result in additional regulation that could adversely affect our ability to promote, manufacture and sell our products.\nIn addition, if a product we design or manufacture was defective or found to be so by a competent regulatory authority, we may be required to correct or recall the product and notify other regulatory authorities. The adverse publicity resulting from a correction or recall, however imposed, could damage our reputation and cause customers to review and potentially terminate their relationships with us. A product correction or recall could consume management time, cause us to lose new orders, cause customers to cancel or delay installation of existing orders, or cause us to incur significant costs, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operation.\nWe maintain limited product liability and healthcare professional liability insurance coverage and do not maintain errors and omissions insurance. Our product liability and healthcare professional liability insurance policies are expensive and have high deductible amounts and self-insured retentions. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate, and future policies may not be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts, if at all. If a material claim is successfully brought against us, we may have to pay substantial damages if they are not covered by insurance.\nWe are subject to certain risks related to the separation of our former imaging components business into Varex Imaging Corporation.\nOn January 28, 2017, we completed the separation of our former Imaging Components business through the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common stock of Varex Imaging Corporation (\u201cVarex\u201d) to our stockholders. We obtained an opinion of outside counsel to the effect that the separation will qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free to both Varian and its stockholders for United States federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. An opinion of outside counsel represents their legal judgment but is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) or any court. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reflected in the opinion or that a court would not sustain such a challenge.\nADDITIONAL RISKS RELATING TO OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS\nWe may face delays in the installation of our software products, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe may face delays in the installation and acceptance of our software products, which may take more time from order to completion of installation and acceptance than our hardware products. Though several of our software products are cloud-enabled, many of our current software product offerings are designed as on-premise products which must be installed on customer systems on-site. Delays in installation of our software products may arise as a result of a variety of factors, including (i) longer installation timetables resulting from challenges in coordinating on-site visits with the customer personnel, (ii) customer IT systems not being ready to host the installation, or (iii) the planning and customization required to deploy our software products in order to be compatible with a customer\u2019s unique, complex and/or dated health IT systems. Delays in installation of our software products could result in delays in our ability to recognize revenues from the sale of these products, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial performance.\nThe need to maintain and service multiple versions of the same software product across our installed base of customers could adversely affect our ability to release upgraded or new products.\nBecause there is no uniform practice among our customer base of updating to more recent versions of our software products and, for a variety of reasons, many of our customers do not regularly update to the newest version of our software products, at any point in time our installed base of customers may be running several different versions of our software products. The need to maintain and service multiple versions of the same software product across our installed base of customers can be cumbersome, time consuming and may require more personnel and other resources than would be the case if all of our customers utilized the same versions of our software products. Moreover, the fact that not all of our customers run the same version of our software products can complicate our ability to efficiently release upgrades to, or new versions of, our software products across our installed base. Similar complications to the release and installation of upgrades may be experienced with certain of our cloud-enabled products that have been developed using single tenant architecture, such as our 360 Oncology product. In addition, in many instances, unless a customer has a certain version of our software products installed, their system will not be compatible with certain of our other software or hardware products. Our inability to release new versions of software to customers or to sell customers other products because of incompatibility issues hurts our revenues and may make revenue projection less predictable.\nCoding errors in our software and cloud offerings could adversely affect our results of operations.\nDespite extensive testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service, our software and cloud offerings sometimes contain coding or manufacturing errors that can impact their function, performance and security, and result in other negative consequences. The detection and correction of any errors in released software or cloud offerings can be time consuming and costly. Errors in our software or cloud offerings could affect their ability to properly function or operate with other software, hardware or cloud offerings, delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services, create security vulnerabilities in our products or services, and adversely affect market acceptance of our products or services. If we experience errors or delays in releasing our software or cloud offerings or new versions thereof, our sales could be affected, and revenues could decline.\nWe may not be successful in transitioning our customer base to software solutions deployed via cloud and SaaS solutions.\nWe are expanding our software product lines and investing in the development of cloud and SaaS solutions. Cloud and SaaS solutions for use in the health care industry must comply with stringent regulations in many of the countries in which our customers are located, particularly in relation to the use and storage of patient health data and privacy, and the regulations vary on a country-by-country basis. Our software products must be compliant with applicable regulation in the country in question before we can operationalize our offerings for customers located in those countries. Ensuring the compliance of our cloud and SaaS solutions with applicable regulation may take longer than expected, occur more slowly in certain countries than in others, require that design changes be developed into our products, or require more financial resources than anticipated.\nIn addition, even where our cloud and SaaS solutions are compliant with applicable regulation, customers may nevertheless refuse to adopt our products for numerous reasons, particularly in regards to the security of patient health data. Moreover, unless and until our cloud and SaaS solutions find general acceptance among our customer base, we would likely need to maintain and continue to develop both our on-premise software product offerings and our cloud and SaaS solution platforms, which could prevent us from realizing the full benefits and efficiencies from transitioning to a cloud platform, result in higher costs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial performance.\nAn increase in the prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors could also unfavorably impact the pricing of our on-premise software offerings and have a dampening impact on overall demand for our on-premise software product and related service offerings, which could reduce our revenues and profitability. In addition, to the extent that demand for our cloud offerings increases in the future, we may experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of revenue recognition between our software licenses and our cloud offering arrangements.\nFurthermore, our cloud and SaaS software products may reside upon and be hosted by third party providers. A security breach, whether of our products, of our customers\u2019 network security and systems or of third-party hosting services, could disrupt treatments utilizing our products, disrupt access to our customers\u2019 stored information, such as patient treatment delivery instructions, and could lead to the loss of, damage to or public disclosure of our customers\u2019 stored information, including patient health information.\nBecause we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our SaaS solutions over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in our SaaS business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nWe recognize SaaS related revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter relating to our SaaS products is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. Any such decline, however, could negatively impact our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our SaaS solutions, and potential changes in our attrition rate, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods.\nCertain software that we use in our products is licensed from third parties and, for that reason, may not be available to us in the future, which has the potential to delay product development and production or cause us to incur additional expenses.\nSome of our software products contain software licensed from third parties. Some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us or allow our products to remain competitive. The loss of these third-party licenses or the inability to maintain any of them on commercially acceptable terms could delay development of future products or the enhancement of existing products. We may also choose to pay a premium price for such a license in certain circumstances, thereby reducing the gross margin of our software sales.\nADDITIONAL RISKS RELATING TO OUR PROTON SOLUTIONS BUSINESS\nWe participate in project financing for our Proton Solutions business, which has resulted in impairment charges and could result in payment defaults that adversely affect our financial results.\nWe have participated along with others in providing financing for the construction and start-up operations of several proton therapy centers and may provide financing to other proton therapy customers in the future. As of September 27, 2019, we had $165.2 million of loans outstanding, including accrued interest, available-for-sale securities, notes receivable and short-term senior secured debt related to Proton Solutions customers. See \u201cManagement Discussion and Analysis - Overview - Proton Solutions\u201d and Note 15, \"Proton Solutions Loans and Investment,\" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the carrying value of our outstanding loans relating to the establishment of proton therapy centers. Providing such financing has adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our financial results, since a center may not be completed on time or within budget, or may not generate sufficient patient volumes and revenues to support scheduled loan payments or facilitate a refinancing. If a borrower does not have the financial means to pay off loan amounts owing to us, and if we cannot recover loan amounts owing to us from the sale of any collateral or through other means, or in the event of a bankruptcy of the borrower, we may be required to write-off all, or a portion, of the loans, which would adversely affect our financial results. For example, in fiscal year 2017, the California Proton Therapy Center, LLC (\u201cCPTC\u201d), to which we had project financing outstanding, filed for bankruptcy and we recorded $51.4 million in impairment charges related to that financing. We also recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $37.8 million related to CPTC and one other proton center in fiscal year 2017. Similarly, in fiscal year 2018, we recorded impairment charges of $22.1 million on our subordinated loans to the Maryland Proton Therapy Center (\u201cMPTC\u201d). Please refer to \u201cManagement Discussion and Analysis - Overview - Varian Proton Solutions\u201d and Note 15, \"Proton Solutions Loans and Investment,\" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of the impairment of the loan we extended. Any impairment charges relating to our Proton Solutions business could have a material adverse impact our operating results and financial position.\nThe financial results of our Proton Solutions business may be unpredictable and if our proton customers are unsuccessful, our financial results will be adversely affected.\nThe success of our Proton Solutions business will depend upon the widespread awareness, acceptance and adoption by the oncology market of proton therapy systems for the treatment of cancer. This technology is expensive and has not been widely adopted. Future developments may not be adopted as quickly as technological developments in more traditional areas of radiation therapy.\nSince proton therapy projects are generally large, highly customized and more complex than projects in our Oncology Systems radiotherapy business, planning for these projects takes more resources. Many of the components used in proton therapy equipment require long lead times, which may require an increase in our inventory levels. This may cause fluctuations in the operating results of Proton Solutions that may make it difficult to predict our results and compare our results from period to period.\nThe construction of a proton therapy facility requires significant capital investment and may involve complex project financing. Consequently, this business is vulnerable to deterioration in general economic and market conditions. Economic downturns that result in a contraction in credit markets, have made and may continue to make it more difficult for potential customers of this business to find appropriate financing for large proton therapy projects, which could cause them to delay or cancel their projects, or request payment concessions in their agreements with us, which could adversely impact our operating results.\nProton therapy is expensive and changes in reimbursement rates for proton therapy treatments or uncertainty regarding these reimbursement rates can affect growth or demand for our Proton Solutions products and services.\nAfter a proton therapy facility is established, there can be no assurance that it will have sufficient patient volume to be successful or profitable. If a proton treatment center cannot generate sufficient patient volume, it may lead to a need to refinance or renegotiate debt, seek concession on payments, or ultimately insolvency and bankruptcy, as in the case of CPTC and the Rinecker Proton Therapy Center in Germany, which has and may in the future require us to impair loans if we have extended loans to the proton treatment center, or to record an allowance for doubtful accounts against accounts receivables due from the proton treatment center.\nOur estimates as to future operating results include certain assumptions about the future results of Proton Solutions\u2019 business. If we are incorrect in our assumptions, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected. It is possible that Proton Solutions could perform significantly below our expectations due to a number of factors that cannot be predicted with certainty,\nincluding future market conditions, market acceptance of proton therapy and reimbursement rates. These factors could adversely impact Proton Solutions' ability to meet its projected results. For example, during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, we recorded a goodwill charge of $50.5 million for the full value of the Proton Solutions reporting unit goodwill, which resulted from a downward revision of forecasted future cash flows attributable to continued weakness in proton therapy markets and lower than expected results as compared to prior forecasts.\nWe compete for many proton therapy system sales through tenders, where parties compete on price and other factors. Many companies sell their products at a lower price than we do. If we are unable to lower our prices or our customers are not willing to pay for additional features and functionality that we may provide, we may lose sales, and if we lower our prices to gain business, our margins and other financial results may suffer. Further, the award of certain proton therapy system orders may be subject to challenge by third parties, which can make these orders more unpredictable than orders for other products. Because an order for a proton therapy system can be large and complex, and the sales cycle for proton therapy projects may take several years, an order in one fiscal period may cause our gross orders and revenues to vary significantly, making it difficult to predict and compare our results of operations from period to period.\nWe expect that a limited number of customers will account for a substantial portion of Proton Solutions' business for the foreseeable future. In instances where one customer undertakes multiple proton center projects, an adverse event with respect to one project could cause an adverse event with respect to the other projects, which in turn could adversely impact our operating results and financial position.\nOur Proton Solutions business may subject us to increased liability.\nOur Proton Solutions' business may subject us to increased liability. For example, because proton therapy projects are large in scale and require detailed project planning, failure to deliver or delays in delivering on our commitments could result in greater than expected liabilities, as we could be required to indemnify business partners and customers for losses suffered or incurred if we are unable to deliver our products in accordance with the terms of customer contracts. Additionally, customers have in the past requested and may in the future request that the systems vendor, as the primary technology provider, provide guarantees for and suffer penalties in relation to the overall construction project. Since the cost of a proton therapy center project can often exceed $100 million, the amount of potential liability and potential for financial loss would likely be higher than the levels historically assumed by us for our traditional radiation therapy business and may also exceed the project\u2019s value. Insurance covering these contingencies may be unobtainable or expensive. If we cannot reasonably mitigate or eliminate these contingencies or risks, our ability to competitively bid upon proton center projects will be negatively impacted or we may be required to assume material amounts of potential liability, all of which may have adverse consequences to us.\nADDITIONAL RISKS RELATED TO OUR CANCER TREATMENT SERVICES INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS\nIn June 2019, we acquired CTSI, which through its America Oncology Institute (\u201cAOI\u201d) business operates nine multi-disciplinary cancer centers and one specialty hospital in India, and one multi-disciplinary cancer center in Sri Lanka, as of September 27, 2019 (collectively, \u201ccancer centers\u201d). CTSI also operates AmPath, a full-service reference laboratory and pathology provider in India. Our AOI and AmPath businesses subject us to a number of risks, including those set forth below.\nOur cancer center operations may not be profitable, and the operation or development of existing and future cancer centers could cause us to incur unexpected costs.\nThe operation and development of cancer centers is subject to a number of risks, including the inability to obtain regulatory permits or approval, delays in the construction of facilities and environmental liabilities related to the disposal of radioactive, chemical and medical waste. Our strategy includes the development of additional multidisciplinary cancer centers, and we have several cancer centers under construction and several others in various planning stages. Any failure or delay in successfully building new cancer centers, as well as liabilities from ongoing operations, could seriously harm our operating results. New cancer centers may incur significant operating losses during their initial operations, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, in some cases our cancer centers may not be profitable enough for us to recover our investment. We may decide to close or sell cancer centers, either because of underperformance or other market developments.\nOur performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians, qualified nurses and medical support staff and we face competition for staffing that may increase our labor costs and harm our results of operations.\nTypically, physicians are responsible for making admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment at the cancer centers that we operate. As a result, the success and competitive advantage of our cancer centers may depend, in part, on\nthe number and quality of the physicians and the medical staffs of our cancer centers, the admitting practices of those physicians and our maintenance of good relations with those physicians. In many cases, physicians are not employees of our cancer centers, and, in a number of the regions in which we operate, physicians have admitting privileges at other cancer centers or hospitals in addition to our cancer centers. They may terminate their affiliation with us at any time. If we are unable to provide adequate support personnel and technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians, they may be discouraged from treating patients at our facilities and our results of operations may decline.\nIn addition, we depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians and other healthcare professionals. We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management, nurses and other medical personnel. There is a nationwide shortage of nurses and other medical support personnel in India which from time to time may require us to enhance wages and benefits in order to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or require us to hire expensive temporary personnel. To the extent we cannot hire adequate numbers of medical support personnel, we may be required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets, which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our results of operation.\nWe cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by the future availability or cost of attracting and retaining talented medical support staff. If our general labor and related expenses increase, we may not be able to raise our rates correspondingly. Our failure to recruit and retain qualified management, nurses and other medical support personnel, or control our labor costs could harm our results of operations.\nOur cancer centers face competition for patients from other cancer centers, hospitals and health care providers.\nThe healthcare industry in India is highly competitive and competition among cancer centers, hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients and physicians has intensified in recent years. In all the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other cancer centers or hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our facilities. We also face competition from specialty hospitals (some of which are physician-owned) and unaffiliated freestanding outpatient centers for market share in high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel. In recent years, the number of freestanding specialty hospitals, surgery centers, emergency departments, urgent care centers and diagnostic imaging centers in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly. Furthermore, some of the hospitals that compete with our hospitals are owned by government agencies or not-for-profit organizations supported by endowments and charitable contributions and can finance capital expenditures and operations on a tax-exempt basis. If our competitors are better able to attract patients, recruit physicians, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities than we are, we may experience an overall decline in patient volumes.\nWe are subject to occupational health, safety and other similar regulations and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business and results of operations.\nOur CTSI operations in India are subject to a wide variety of Indian national and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations. Regulatory requirements affecting us include, but are not limited to, those covering: (i) air and water quality control; (ii) occupational health and safety (e.g., standards regarding blood-borne pathogens and ergonomics, etc.); (iii) waste management; (iv) the handling of asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls and radioactive substances; and (v) other hazardous materials. If we fail to comply with those standards, we may be subject to sanctions and penalties that could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our cancer centers and third-party customers of our AmPath business.\nWe are subject to medical malpractice lawsuits, class action lawsuits and other legal actions against our cancer centers and third-party customers of our AmPath business in the ordinary course of business. Some of these actions may involve large claims, as well as significant defense costs. We cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or the effect that such lawsuits may have on us. In an effort to resolve one or more of these matters, we may choose to negotiate a settlement. Amounts we pay to settle any of these matters may be material. We maintain limited healthcare professional liability insurance coverage and do not maintain errors and omissions insurance. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate, and future policies may not be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts, if at all. If a material claim is successfully brought against us, we may have to pay substantial damages if they are not covered by insurance, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS\nAny inability to obtain supplies of important components could restrict the manufacture of products, cause delays in delivery, or significantly increase our costs.\nWe obtain some of the components included in our products from a limited group of suppliers or from a single source supplier, such as the radioactive sources for high dose rate brachytherapy, klystrons for linear accelerators and specialized integrated circuits and various other components; radiofrequency components, magnets, patient positioning systems and gantry hardware for proton therapy systems, and vacuum sleeves for our cryoablation products.\nIf we lose any of these suppliers, if their operations were substantially interrupted, or if any of them failed to meet performance or quality specifications, we may be required to obtain and qualify one or more replacement suppliers. Such an event may then also require us to redesign or modify our products to incorporate new parts and/or further require us to obtain clearance, qualification or certification of these products by the FDA or obtain other applicable regulatory approvals in other countries. Events like these could significantly increase costs for the affected product and likely cause material delays in delivery of our products, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations.\nSome of our single-source suppliers provide components for some of our growing product lines. Manufacturing capacity limitations of any of our suppliers or other inability of these suppliers to meet increasing demand could adversely affect us, resulting in curtailed growth opportunities for our affected product lines. Shortage of, and greater demand for, components and subassemblies could also increase manufacturing costs if the supply/demand imbalance increases the price of the components and subassemblies. Disruptions or loss of any of our limited-sourced or sole-sourced components or subassemblies or the capacity limitations of the suppliers for these components or subassemblies could adversely affect our business and financial results and could damage our customer relationships.\nIn addition, following the separation of our former Imaging Components business into Varex in January 2017, Varex is the sole source supplier of tubes, panels and detector components used in certain of our products, such as our On-Board Imager. Any disruption or reduction in the supply of these components could result in delays or reductions in our product deliveries, which could adversely affect our business and financial results and could damage our customer relationships. Also, any unforecasted increases in the price of these components could adversely impact our profitability.\nA shortage or change in source of raw materials could restrict our ability to manufacture products, cause delays, or significantly increase our cost of goods.\nWe rely upon the supplies of certain raw materials such as tungsten, lead, iridium and copper for Oncology Systems and high-grade steel, high-grade copper and iron for Proton Solutions. Worldwide demand, availability and pricing of these raw materials have been volatile, and we expect that availability and pricing will continue to fluctuate in the future. If supplies are restricted or become unavailable or if prices increase, this could constrain our manufacturing of affected products, reduce our profit margins or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC has promulgated rules regarding disclosure of the presence in a company\u2019s products of certain metals, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d which are metals mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries, as well as procedures regarding a manufacturer\u2019s efforts to identify the sourcing of those minerals from this region. Complying with these rules requires investigative efforts, which has and will continue to cause us to incur associated costs, and could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products, or result in process or manufacturing modifications, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur financial results may suffer if we are not able to match our manufacturing capacity with demand for our products.\nMany of our products have a long production cycle, and we need to anticipate demand for our products in order to ensure adequate manufacturing or testing capacity. If we are unable to anticipate demand and our manufacturing or testing capacity does not keep pace with product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner, which may negatively impact our financial results and overall business. Conversely, if demand for our products decreases, the fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity may harm our financial results.\nWe rely on third parties to perform spare parts shipping and other logistics functions on our behalf. Disruptions at our logistics providers may adversely impact our business.\nThird-party logistics providers store a significant portion of our spare parts inventory in depots around the world and perform a significant portion of our spare parts logistics and shipping activities. If any of our logistics providers terminates its relationship with us, suffers an interruption in its business, or experiences delays, disruptions or quality control problems in its operations, or if we have to change and qualify alternative logistics providers for our spare parts, shipments of spare parts to our customers may be delayed and our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry, and we face significant costs in complying with laws and regulations. Failure or delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or complying with laws and regulations could delay or prevent product distribution, the introduction of new products or services and result in significant fines and penalties.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and our products and services are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, as discussed in \u201cPart 1, Item 1. Business - Government Regulation.\u201d Our products, services and operations are subject to regulation by the FDA, the state of California and other U.S. states, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (\"NRC\u201d) and regulatory bodies in the countries and regions in which we market our products and services. For example, we must comply with FDA medical device clearance and reporting regulations, and similar laws in numerous foreign countries, including the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), Switzerland, China, Japan and Canada; and we must comply with NRC clearance, approval and licensing requirements and other federal, state and foreign laws that regulate the use of radioactive materials. We are also subject to laws and regulations in India and Sri Lanka in relation to the operation of healthcare establishments. Compliance with these regulations can be costly, time consuming and burdensome, may negatively impact our ability to market our products and services or result in significant delays or even prevent the marketing and full commercialization of future products or services. Moreover, failure to obtain regulatory approvals or renewals in a timely manner could subject us to fines and penalties.\nAs a participant in the healthcare industry, we are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse, physician payment transparency, false claims and misleading advertisements. These laws and regulations and their enforcement are constantly undergoing change, and we cannot predict what effect, if any, changes to these laws and regulations may have on our business or the businesses of our customers. Non-compliance with \u201canti-kickback\u201d, \u201cfalse claims\u201d and transparency laws and regulations can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and potential mandatory or discretionary exclusion from healthcare programs.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations related to the collection, processing, storage, transfer and use of personal data, including under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") and data protection legislation in other foreign jurisdictions and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d) and similar laws in the United States, at both the federal and state level. The compliance and other burdens imposed by the GDPR, CCPA and similar privacy laws and regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, require us to modify our data handling practices, slow the pace at which we close sales transactions and impose additional costs and burdens. In particular, the collection, storage, transfer and use of patient information and data obtained through our AOI business operations is highly regulated by applicable law. In addition, non-compliance could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and/or significant fines, could negatively impact our reputation, and may otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs we enter new businesses or pursue new business opportunities that require clinical trials, we may seek to conduct clinical studies or trials in the United States or other countries on products that have not yet been cleared or approved for a particular indication. Additional regulations govern the approval, initiation, conduct, monitoring, documentation and reporting of clinical studies to regulatory agencies in the countries or regions in which they are conducted. Failure to comply with all regulations governing such studies could subject us to significant enforcement actions and sanctions, including halting of the study, seizure of investigational devices or data, sanctions against investigators, civil or criminal penalties, and other actions. In addition, without the data from one or more clinical studies, it may not be possible for us to secure the data necessary to support certain regulatory submissions, to secure reimbursement or demonstrate other requirements. We cannot assure you that access to clinical investigators, sites and subjects, documentation and data will be available on the terms and timeframes necessary.\nAny failure or delay in complying with one or more of the regulatory requirements we face could result in reduced sales, increased costs, delays to new product introductions, enhancements or our strategic plans, or harm to our reputation or competitiveness, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nThe Affordable Care Act includes provisions that may adversely affect our business, including an excise tax on the sales of most medical devices.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the \u201cACA\u201d) became effective in 2010. The ACA could adversely impact the demand for our products and services, and therefore our financial position and results of operations, possibly materially. Specifically, one of the components of the ACA is a 2.3% excise tax on sales of most medical devices, which include our Oncology Systems and Proton Solutions products, which took effect on January 1, 2013. In January 2018, President Trump signed into law a spending package that included a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax starting January 1, 2018 and ending December 31, 2019. This tax has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our gross margin when the moratorium expires.\nIn addition, discussions relating to the ACA have included the possibility for bundled reimbursement payments and ACOs. ACOs and bundled payment programs were established by the ACA to reward integrated, efficient care and allow providers to share in any savings they achieve through the coordination of care and meeting certain mandated quality standards. ACOs and the bundled payment programs have primarily focused on primary care. However, some customers appear to be developing new partnerships across clinical specialties to prepare for the possibility of operating in an ACO environment and bundled reimbursement payments. These and other elements of the ACA, including comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, payment system reforms (including shared savings pilots) and the reporting of certain payments by us to healthcare professionals and hospitals, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered, and may materially impact numerous aspects of our business, including the demand and availability of our products, the reimbursement available for our products from governmental and third-party payors, and medical procedure volumes. We believe that growth of the radiation oncology market, which includes both traditional radiation therapy as well as proton therapy in the United States could be adversely impacted as customers\u2019 decision-making processes are complicated by the uncertainties surrounding the implementation of the ACA and reimbursement rates for radiotherapy and radiosurgery, and that this uncertainty will likely continue into the next fiscal year and could result in a high degree of variability of gross orders and revenues from quarter-to-quarter.\nVarious healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level, and we are unable to predict which, if any of these proposals will be enacted. We are also unable to predict what effect ongoing uncertainty surrounding federal and state health reform proposals, uncertainty related to implementation of ACA provisions, and instability within insurance markets created under the ACA, will have on our customer\u2019s purchasing decisions. However, an expansion in government\u2019s role in the United States healthcare industry may adversely affect our business, possibly materially. In addition, it is possible that changes in administration and policy, including the potential repeal of all or parts of the ACA could result in additional proposals and/or changes to health care system legislation which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The full effect that a full or partial repeal of the ACA would have on our business remains unclear at this time.\nMore recently, President Trump has signed an executive order and made statements that suggest he plans to seek repeal of all or portions of the ACA, and has asked Congress to replace the current legislation with new legislation. There is uncertainty with respect to the impact President Trump\u2019s administration may have, if any, and any changes likely will take time to unfold, and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the ACA. However, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us.\nChanges to radiation oncology, reimbursements, and insurance deductibles and administration may affect demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and stock price.\nSales of our healthcare products indirectly depend on whether adequate reimbursement is available to our customers from a variety of sources, such as government healthcare insurance programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs; private insurance plans; health maintenance organizations; and preferred provider organizations. In general, employers and third-party payors in the United States have become increasingly cost-conscious, with higher deductibles imposed or encouraged in many medical plans. The imposition of higher deductibles tends to inhibit individuals from seeking the same level of medical treatments as they might seek if the costs were lower. Third-party payors have also increased utilization controls related to the use of our products by healthcare providers.\nThere is no uniform policy on reimbursement among third-party payors, and we cannot be sure that third-party payors will reimburse our customers at a level that will enable us to achieve or maintain adequate sales and price levels for our products. Without adequate support from third-party payors, the market for our products may be limited.\nOnce Medicare makes a decision to provide reimbursement for a given treatment, these reimbursement rates are generally reviewed and adjusted by Medicare annually. Private third-party payors, although independent from Medicare, sometimes use portions of Medicare reimbursement policies and payment amounts in making their own reimbursement decisions. As a result, decisions by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") to reimburse for a treatment, or changes to Medicare\u2019s reimbursement policies or reductions in payment amounts may extend to third-party payor reimbursement policies and amounts\nfor that treatment. We have seen our customers\u2019 decision-making process complicated by the uncertainty surrounding Medicare reimbursement rates and coverage for modalities and indications for radiotherapy and radiosurgery in the United States.\nFrom time to time, CMS and third-party payors may review and modify the factors upon which they rely to determine appropriate levels of reimbursement and coverage of procedures for cancer treatments. For example, CMS and third-party payors have begun to focus on the comparative effectiveness of radiation therapy versus other methods of cancer treatment, including surgery, and could modify reimbursement rates based on the results of comparative effectiveness studies. In addition, in July 2019, CMS announced a proposed alternative payment model (or \u201cAPM\u201d) pilot program for radiation oncology intended to test whether an episode-based payment structure across a cohort of U.S. hospitals and freestanding cancer centers would reduce Medicare expenditures, while preserving or enhancing the quality of care. We expect that CMS will announce the APM rules in late 2019, although the exact timing and details of the APM are uncertain. Any significant cuts in reimbursement rates or changes in reimbursement methodology or administration for radiotherapy, radiosurgery, proton therapy or brachytherapy, as a result of APM or otherwise, or concerns or proposals regarding further cuts or changes in methodology or administration, could further increase uncertainty, influence our customers\u2019 decisions, reduce demand for our products, cause customers to cancel orders, make it more difficult for us to collect payments on outstanding accounts receivable or indebtedness from our proton therapy center customers or debtors, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and stock price.\nForeign governments also have their own healthcare reimbursement systems and there can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement will be made available with respect to our products under any foreign reimbursement system.\nAny violation of federal, state or foreign laws governing our business practices may result in substantial penalties. Investigation into our business practices could cause adverse publicity and harm our business.\nAnti-corruption laws and regulations. We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-corruption laws, and similar laws in foreign countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and the Law \u201cOn the Fundamentals of Health Protection in the Russian Federation.\u201d Any violation of these laws by us or our agents or distributors could create a substantial liability for us, subject our officers and directors to personal liability and also cause a loss of reputation in the market. Transparency International\u2019s 2016 Corruption Perceptions Index found that approximately sixty-nine percent of the countries in the index, including many that we consider to be high growth areas for our products, such as China, India, Russia and Brazil, scored below 50, on a scale from 100 (very clean) to 0 (highly corrupt). We currently operate in many countries where the public sector is perceived as being more or highly corrupt. Our strategic business plans include expanding our business in regions and countries that are rated as higher risk for corruption activity by Transparency International. Moreover, our recent acquisitions of CTSI and Alicon have significantly increased our operations in India and China, respectively. Increased business in higher risk countries could subject us and our officers and directors to increased scrutiny and increased liability.\nIn addition, we have conducted, and in the future expect to conduct internal investigations or face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies. Any such investigation or proceeding results in costs and management distraction, which could adversely affect our business and financial results. An adverse outcome under any such proceeding, investigation or audit could subject us to fines, or criminal or other penalties, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nCompetition laws. We are subject to competition laws in the regions where we do business. Regulatory authorities under whose laws we operate may have enforcement powers that can subject us to sanctions and can impose changes or conditions in the way we conduct our business. In addition, an increasing number of jurisdictions provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to seek damages asserting claims of anti-competitive conduct. Increased government scrutiny of our actions or enforcement or private rights of action could adversely affect our business or damage our reputation. In addition, we have conducted, and in the future expect to conduct, internal investigations or face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies, which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or criminal or other penalties, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nEnvironmental laws impose compliance costs on our business and can result in liability.\nWe are subject to environmental laws around the world. These laws regulate many aspects of our operations, including our handling, storage, transport and disposal of hazardous materials. They can also impose cleanup liabilities, including with respect to discontinued operations. As a consequence, we can incur significant environmental costs and liabilities, some recurring and others not recurring. Although we follow procedures intended to comply with existing environmental laws, we,\nlike other businesses, can never completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from certain materials that we use in our business and, therefore, the prospect of resulting claims and damage payments. We may also be assessed fines or penalties for failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Although insurance has provided coverage for portions of cleanup costs resulting from historical occurrences, we maintain only limited insurance coverage for costs or claims that might result from any future contamination.\nFuture changes in environmental laws could also increase our costs of doing business, perhaps significantly. Several countries, including some in the EU, now require medical equipment manufacturers to bear certain disposal costs of products at the end of the product\u2019s useful life, increasing our costs. The EU has also adopted directives that may lead to restrictions on the use of certain hazardous substances or other regulated substances in some of our products sold there. These directives, along with another that requires substance information to be provided upon request, could increase our operating costs in order to maintain access to certain markets. All of these costs, and any future violations or liabilities under environmental laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nProtecting our intellectual property can be costly and we may not be able to maintain licensed rights, which would harm our business.\nWe file applications for patents covering new products and manufacturing processes. We cannot assure you that our current patents, the claims allowed under our current patents, or the patents for technologies licensed to us will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology position against competitors. Issued patents owned by, or licensed to, us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or the rights granted under the patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. We also cannot be sure that patents will be issued from any of our pending or future patent applications. Asserting our patent rights against others in litigation or other legal proceedings is costly and diverts resources. An unfavorable outcome in such litigation or proceedings could harm us. In addition, we may not be able to detect patent infringement by others or may lose our competitive position in the market before we are able to do so. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property do not prevent competitors from independently developing similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal or superior to our technology and products without infringing any of our intellectual property rights, or from designing around our proprietary technologies, which could harm us. In addition, the regulations of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nIn addition to patents, we also rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret, trademark and other laws, and contractual restrictions on disclosure, copying and transferring title (including confidentiality agreements with vendors, strategic partners, co-developers, employees, consultants and other third parties), to protect our proprietary and other confidential rights. These protections may prove inadequate, since agreements may still be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for a breach, and our trade secrets may otherwise become known to or be independently developed by others. In the event that our proprietary or confidential information is misappropriated, our business and financial results could be adversely impacted. We have trademarks, both registered and unregistered, that are maintained and enforced to provide customer recognition for our products in the marketplace, but unauthorized third parties may still use them. We also have agreements with third parties that license to us certain patented or proprietary technologies. In some cases, products with substantial revenues may depend on these license rights. If we were to lose the rights to license these technologies, or our costs to license these technologies were to materially increase, our business would suffer.\nThird parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation over patent and other intellectual property rights in the industries in which we compete. Our competitors, like companies in many high technology businesses, continually review other companies\u2019 activities for possible conflicts with their own intellectual property rights. In addition, non-practicing entities may review our activities for conflicts with their patent rights. Determining whether a product infringes a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights involves complex legal and factual issues, and the outcome of this type of litigation is uncertain. Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. We may not be aware of the intellectual property rights of others that relate to our products, services or technologies. From time to time, we receive notices from third parties asserting infringement and we are subject to lawsuits alleging infringement of third-party patent or other intellectual property rights. Any dispute regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. We may not prevail in a dispute. We do not maintain insurance for intellectual property infringement, so costs of defense, whether or not we are successful in defending an infringement claim, will be borne by us and could be significant. If we are unsuccessful in defending or appealing an infringement claim, we may be subject to significant\ndamages and our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. We may also be subject to injunctions against development and sale of our products, the effect of which could be to materially reduce our revenues.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nFluctuations in our operating results, including quarterly gross orders, revenues, margins, and cash flows may cause our stock price to be volatile, resulting in losses for our stockholders.\nWe have experienced and expect to experience periodic fluctuations in our operating results, including gross orders, revenues, margins and cash flows. Drivers of orders include the introduction and timing of announcement of new products or product enhancements by us and our competitors, as well as changes or anticipated changes in third-party reimbursement amounts or policies applicable to treatments using our products. The availability of economic stimulus packages or other government funding, or reductions thereof, may also affect timing of customer purchases. Many of our products require significant capital expenditures by our customers. Accordingly, individual product orders can be quite large in dollar amounts, which can extend the customer purchasing cycle. We have experienced this with our IGRT products, and it is especially true with our proton therapy products because of the high cost of the proton therapy equipment and the complexity of project financing. In addition, the budgeting cycles of hospitals and clinics for capital equipment purchases are frequently fixed well in advance. Economic uncertainty also tends to extend the purchasing cycle as potential customers more closely scrutinize and prioritize their capital spending budgets and analyze appropriate financing alternatives. In addition, some of our more sophisticated equipment, such as IGRT and proton therapy products, requires greater site preparation and longer construction cycles, which can delay customer decision cycles and the placement of orders even further. The timing of order placement, equipment installation and revenue recognition affect our quarterly results.\nOnce orders are received and booked into backlog, factors that may affect whether these orders become revenue (or are cancelled or deemed dormant and reflected as a reduction in the backlog amounts) and the timing of revenue include:\n\u2022\ndelay in shipment due (e.g. an unanticipated construction delay at a customer location where our products are to be installed), cancellations or rescheduling by customers, extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, port strikes or other labor actions;\n\u2022a challenge to a bid award for one or more of our products;\n\u2022delay in the installation and/or acceptance of a product;\n\u2022failure to satisfy contingencies associated with an order;\n\u2022the method of accounting used to recognize revenue;\n\u2022a change in a customer\u2019s financial condition or ability to obtain financing; or\n\u2022timing of necessary regulatory approvals or authorizations.\nOur operating results, including our margins, may also be affected by a number of other factors, many of which are out of our control, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nchanges in our or our competitors\u2019 pricing or discount levels;\n\u2022\nimposition of tariffs on our products or components and services used in our products;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity about our products and services;\n\u2022\nimpairment of loans, notes receivables, accounts receivable;\n\u2022changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022changes in the relative mix between higher margin and lower margin products;\n\u2022changes in the relative portion of our revenues represented by different geographic regions;\n\u2022fluctuation in our effective tax rate, which may or may not be known to us in advance;\n\u2022changes to our organizational structure, which may result in restructuring or other charges;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in the supply or changes in the costs of raw materials, labor, product components or transportation services;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in our operations, including our ability to manufacture products, caused by events such as earthquakes, fires, floods, terrorist attacks or the outbreak of epidemic diseases;\n\u2022\nthe unfavorable outcome of any litigation or administrative proceeding or inquiry, as well as ongoing costs associated with legal proceedings; and\n\u2022\naccounting changes and adoption of new accounting pronouncements.\nBecause many of our operating expenses are based on anticipated capacity levels and a high percentage of these expenses are fixed for the short term, a small variation in the timing of revenue recognition can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter. Our overall gross margin may also be impacted by the gross margin of our proton therapy products, which presently carry lower gross margins than do our traditional radiotherapy products. If our gross margins fall below the expectation of securities analysts and investors, the trading price of VMS common stock would likely decline.\nWe report our gross orders and backlog on a quarterly and annual basis. It is important to understand that, unlike revenues, gross orders and backlog are not governed by GAAP, and are not within the scope of the quarterly review or annual audit conducted by our independent registered public accounting firm; therefore, investors should not interpret our gross orders or backlog in such a manner. Also, for the reasons set forth above, our gross orders and backlog cannot necessarily be relied upon as accurate predictors of future revenues. Order cancellation or delays in delivery dates will reduce our backlog and future revenues, and we cannot predict if or when orders will mature into revenues. Particularly high levels of cancellations in one period will make it difficult to compare our operating results for other periods.\nIn addition, our gross orders, backlog, revenues and net earnings in one or more future periods may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the trading price of VMS common stock would almost certainly decline.", "PERMNO": 27043, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "VAR"}
