{"cik": "1556727", "company": "First Northwest Bancorp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-09-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur increased emphasis on commercial real estate lending subjects us to various risks that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nSince June 30, 2011, we have increased the amount of our commercial real estate and multi-family loans from $91.9 million, or 21.2%, of our total loan portfolio to $158.7 million, or 32.1% of our total loan portfolio, at June 30, 2015. We intend to continue to increase, subject to market demand, our origination and purchase of commercial real estate loans.\nOur increased focus on this type of lending has increased our risk profile relative to traditional one- to four-family lenders. Commercial real estate loans are intended to enhance the average yield of our earning assets; however, they do involve a different level of risk of delinquency or collection than generally associated with one- to four-family loans for a number of reasons. The repayment of commercial real estate loans typically is dependent on the successful operation and income stream of the borrowers\u2019 business, or the ability to lease the property at sufficient rates, and the value of the real estate securing the loan as collateral, which can be significantly affected by economic conditions. These loans also involve larger balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers. Some of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a single one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. Since commercial real estate loans generally have large balances, deterioration in the quality of commercial loans may result in the need to significantly increase our provision for loan losses and charge-offs will likely be larger on a per loan basis compared to consumer loans. As a result, deterioration of this portfolio could materially adversely affect our future earnings. Collateral evaluation and financial statement analysis in these types of loans also requires a more detailed analysis at the time of loan underwriting and on an ongoing basis. Finally, if we foreclose on a commercial real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral is typically longer than for a one- to four-family residence because the secondary market for most types of commercial real estate is not readily liquid, which results in less opportunity to mitigate credit risk by selling part or all of our interest in these assets. At June 30, 2015, we had $147,000 of nonperforming commercial real estate loans and no nonperforming multi-family loans in our portfolio.\nThe unseasoned nature of our commercial loan portfolio may result in errors in judging its collectability, which may lead to additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs, which would hurt our profits.\nOur commercial loan portfolio, which includes loans secured by commercial and multi-family real estate as well as business assets, has increased from $99.8 million, or 23.2% of total loans, at June 30, 2011, to $173.5 million, or 35.1% of total loans, at June 30, 2015. Included in our commercial loan portfolio at June 30, 2015, were $18.2 million of purchased loans and loan participations. A large portion of our commercial loan portfolio is unseasoned, meaning they were originated recently. Our limited experience with these borrowers does not provide us with a significant payment history pattern. Further, First Federal has not experienced a downturn in economic conditions with these borrowers. As a result, it is difficult to predict the future performance of this part of our loan portfolio. These borrowers may develop delinquency or charge-off levels above our historical experience, which could adversely affect our future performance.\nWe have a concentration of large loans outstanding to a limited number of borrowers that increases our risk of loss.\nFirst Federal has extended significant amounts of credit to a limited number of borrowers, largely in connection with high-end residential real estate and commercial and multi-family real estate loans. At June 30, 2015, the aggregate amount of loans, including unused commitments, to First Federal's five largest borrowers (including related entities) amounted to approximately $45.5 million, or 9.2% of total loans. The largest 20 borrowers at June 30, 2015 totaled $117.2 million, or 23.7% of total loans. At such date, none of the loans to First Federal's 20 largest borrowers were nonperforming loans.\nA high concentration of credit to a limited number of borrowers increases the risk in First Federal's loan portfolio. In the event that one or more of these borrowers is not able to service the contractual repayment, the potential loss to First Federal is more likely to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSlower growth in our primary market area has led us to originate and purchase loans outside of our market area which could affect the level of our nonperforming loans.\nWe currently have full service offices on the North Olympic Peninsula and in Kitsap County and a lending office in Whatcom County. The North Olympic Peninsula region, which represents our largest concentration of depositors and borrowers, has experienced limited population growth, and the region's unemployment rate is higher than both the state and national unemployment rates. As a result, we have recently begun to opportunistically originate and purchase loans outside of these areas in the counties surrounding the Puget Sound, and we may purchase loans with different credit and underwriting criteria than those we originate organically. At June 30, 2015, we had approximately $76.0 million of one- to four-family mortgage loans, $23.0 million of multi-family loans and $63.8 million of commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of the North Olympic Peninsula region and Whatcom and Kitsap counties. Included in the one- to four-family residential loans are $12.7 million and $17.5 million of one- to four-family mortgages in the states of California and Ohio, respectively. We also have multi-family and commercial real estate loans of $19.1 million and $71.8 million, respectively, located primarily in Kitsap, King, Pierce and Snohomish counties around the Puget Sound region of Washington. We have not experienced significant loan delinquencies with these out of market area loans; however, declines in economic conditions or real estate values in these markets could significantly adversely affect the level of our nonperforming loans and our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key persons may materially and adversely affect our prospects.\nWe rely heavily on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers, and certain other key management personnel, which make up our management team. The ability to attract, retain and season this management team presents risks to executing our business plan. In the past we have had significant turnover in our management team. The senior management team has been working together for two years. Our president and chief executive officer, Laurence J. Hueth, the former chief financial officer of First Federal, was appointed to his position in January 2013. Mr. Hueth joined First Federal in December 2008. Regina M. Wood, the former controller of First Federal, was appointed chief financial officer in March 2013. Ms. Wood joined First Federal in August 2006. In addition, our chief credit officer, Christopher A. Donohue, joined First Federal in April 2013. From 2005 through 2013, Mr. Donohue worked in various lending and asset resolution positions for several banks located in Nevada. In August 2013, Kelly A. Liske, was appointed our chief banking officer. Ms. Liske joined First Federal in 2006 as branch manager in Port Townsend and was later promoted to commercial relationship manager before becoming chief banking officer. In addition, Jeffrey S. Davis, our executive vice president and chief operating officer, joined First Federal on September 1, 2014, as senior vice president and bank operations officer and was appointed as executive vice president and chief operating officer on February 25, 2015. In March 2015, Mr. Davis was also put in charge of Human Resources following the resignation of Elaine T. Gentilo, Senior Vice President/Chief People Officer of First Federal.\nOur current management team was instrumental in completing the conversion and developing and implementing our current operational strategy. While we believe our current management team has the knowledge and experience to continue to effectively implement this operational strategy, we recognize that these individuals will need time to develop a cohesive and unified senior management team, which could delay the implementation of our operational strategy. The loss of the services of any of our current management team could have a material adverse impact on our operations because we would most likely have to search outside of First Federal for qualified replacements. This search may be prolonged as our current market area is considered remote. This characteristic may make it more difficult for us to find qualified replacements willing to relocate to a smaller community like ours.\nChanges in our current management team and their responsibilities may be disruptive to our business and operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we believe that our relationship with our management team is good, we cannot guarantee that all members of our management team will remain with our organization or successfully transition into their new roles.\nAdverse economic conditions in the market areas we serve could adversely impact our earnings and could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio.\nOur customer base has been historically concentrated in the North Olympic Peninsula region of Washington, in particular Clallam, Jefferson and Kitsap counties. We recently expanded our lending area to include other counties surrounding the Puget Sound and to a lesser extent other parts of Washington. In the most recent economic downturn, this region, as well as much of the rest of the state of Washington, experienced substantial\nhome price declines, increased foreclosures and above average unemployment rates. Continued weakness or further deterioration of economic conditions in the market areas we serve could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022\nloan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and services may decline, possibly resulting in a decrease in our total loans or assets;\n\u2022\ncollateral for loans made may decline further in value, exposing us to increased risk of loss on existing loans and reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power;\n\u2022\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us; and\n\u2022\nthe amount of our deposits may decrease and the composition of our deposits may be adversely affected.\nThere are local factors that may have further adverse impact on the economies in our primary market areas. For example, a study that was released in early 2012 found that areas of the Port Angeles harbor contained high concentrated levels of pollution. Clean up requirements and associated costs could materially affect local businesses and the regional economy. In addition, the health care industry is a significant source of employment within the region. Rising costs as well as changing insurance reimbursement levels have adversely affected the health care industry in recent years. If these rising costs and adverse insurance reimbursement changes continue, many health care organizations may be forced to reduce their operations, which could result in a reduction of the number of jobs, which would adversely affect unemployment rates within the North Olympic Peninsula region of Washington.\nChanging water rights in the state of Washington could adversely affect the value of undeveloped lots and subsequent use for residential and commercial activity within our market area and potentially other rural areas of the state of Washington.\nWashington Department of Ecology requirements and proposals that limit the use of water in rivers and streams, as well as the underground water in related aquifers, have increased costs for and restricted use of water in certain parts of our market area. New water use regulations currently affect both the Dungeness Valley in the east end of Clallam County and the Quilcene and Chimacum areas in Jefferson County, limiting daily use of water from new wells and increasing the cost of water usage, including the requirement of permit fees to drill new wells. These changes have had an adverse impact on the value of undeveloped lots and their subsequent use for residential or commercial activities within our market area and similar areas throughout Washington. At June 30, 2015, we had loans on 51 residential lots aggregating $3.3 million that we believe could be adversely affected, which may reduce the values of these properties.\nOur branching strategy will cause our expenses to increase and may negatively affect our earnings.\nWe are planning up to four new branch openings during the next three years. The success of our expansion strategy into new markets, however, is contingent upon numerous factors, such as our ability to select suitable locations, assess each market's competitive environment, secure managerial resources, hire and retain qualified personnel and implement effective marketing strategies. The opening of new offices may not increase the volume of our loans and deposits as quickly or to the degree that we hope, and opening new offices will increase our operating expenses. On average, de novo branches do not become profitable until three to four years after opening. We currently expect to lease rather than own the additional branches. Further, the projected time line and the estimated dollar amounts involved in opening de novo branches could differ significantly from actual results. In addition, we may not successfully manage the costs and implementation risks associated with our branching strategy. Accordingly, any new branch may negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until the branch reaches certain economies of scale. Finally, there is a risk that our new branches will not be successful even after they have been established.\nOur business may be adversely affected by credit risk associated with residential property.\nAt June 30, 2015, $293.2 million, or 59.4% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of one- to four-family mortgage loans and home equity loans secured by residential properties. Lending on residential property is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. Declines in residential real estate values securing these types of loans may increase the level of borrower defaults and losses above the recent charge-off experience on these loans. Net charge-offs of one- to four-family residential and home equity loans secured by residential properties during fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 totaled $623,000, $918,000 and $804,000,\nrespectively, or 64.8%, 75.9% and 101.5% of total net charge-offs during these periods, respectively. Further, a significant amount of our home equity lines of credit consist of second mortgage loans. For those home equity lines secured by a second mortgage, it is unlikely that we will be successful in recovering all or a portion of our loan balances in the event of default unless we are prepared to repay the first mortgage loan and such repayment and the costs associated with a foreclosure are justified by the value of the property. For these reasons we may experience higher rates of delinquencies, default and losses on loans secured by junior liens.\nOur non-owner-occupied residential real estate loans may expose us to increased credit risk.\nAt June 30, 2015, $27.0 million, or 5.5% of our total loan portfolio, was secured by non-owner-occupied residential properties consisting of one- to four-family and home equity loans. Loans secured by non-owner-occupied properties generally expose a lender to greater risk of nonpayment and loss than loans secured by owner-occupied properties because repayment of such loans depends primarily on the tenant\u2019s continuing ability to pay rent to the property owner, who is our borrower, or, if the property owner is unable to find a tenant, the property owner\u2019s ability to repay the loan without the benefit of a rental income stream. In addition, the physical condition of non-owner-occupied properties is often below that of owner-occupied properties due to lax property maintenance standards, which has a negative impact on the value of the collateral properties. Furthermore, some of our non-owner-occupied residential loan borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us, which may expose us to a greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to an owner-occupied residential mortgage loan.\nRepayment of our commercial business loans is often dependent on the cash flows of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value.\nAt June 30, 2015, we had $14.8 million, or 3.0% of total loans, in commercial business loans. Commercial business lending involves risks that are different from those associated with residential and commercial real estate lending. Real estate lending is generally considered to be collateral based lending with loan amounts based on predetermined loan to collateral values, with liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral being viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. Our commercial business loans are primarily made based on the cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The borrowers' cash flow may be unpredictable, and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Although commercial business loans are often collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of default is often an insufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may be uncollectible and inventories may be obsolete or of limited use, among other things.\nA portion of our loan portfolio is serviced by third parties, which may limit our ability to foreclose on such loans.\nAt June 30, 2015, $32.5 million of our one- to four-family and $2.3 million of our commercial real estate loan portfolios were serviced by third parties. When a loan goes into default, it is the responsibility of the third-party servicer to enforce the borrower\u2019s obligation to repay the outstanding indebtedness. We are reliant on the servicer to bring the loan current, enter into a satisfactory loan modification or foreclose on the property on behalf of First Federal. We must comply with any loan modification entered into by the servicer even if we would not otherwise agree to the modified terms, which may result in a reduction in our interest income due to the loan modification. Delays in foreclosing on property, whether caused by restrictions under state or federal law or the failure of a third party servicer to timely pursue foreclosure action, can increase our potential loss on such property, due to factors such as lack of maintenance, unpaid property taxes and adverse changes in market conditions. These delays may adversely affect our ability to limit our credit losses.\nOur lending limit may restrict our growth.\nWashington law provides that Washington chartered savings banks, such as First Federal, are subject to the same loans to one borrower restrictions as Washington chartered commercial banks, which restricts total loans and extensions of credit by a bank to 20% of its unimpaired capital and surplus. As a result, under Washington law, First Federal would be limited to loans to one borrower of $27.4 million at June 30, 2015. First Federal, however, has elected to restrict its loans to one borrower to no more than 15% of its unimpaired capital plus surplus, which was $18.5 million at June 30, 2015, or $13.0 million, whichever is less, unless specifically approved by the board loan/asset quality committee as an exception to policy. Under this policy, at June 30, 2015, First Federal\u2019s limit on loans to one borrower was $13.0 million. Subsequent to June 30, 2015, First Federal increased its loans to one borrower limit from $13.0 million to $15.0 million. This amount is significantly less than that of many of our competitors and\nmay discourage potential commercial borrowers who have credit needs in excess of our loan to one borrower lending limit from doing business with us. Our loan to one borrower restriction also impacts the efficiency of our commercial lending operation because it lowers our average loan size, which means we have to generate a higher number of transactions to achieve the same portfolio volume. We can accommodate larger loans by selling participations in those loans to other financial institutions, but this strategy is not most efficient or always available. We may not be able to attract or maintain clients seeking larger loans or may not be able to sell participations in these loans on terms we consider favorable.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance for loan losses through the provision for losses on loans which is charged against income.\nAdditionally, pursuant to our growth strategy, as we increase the amount of our commercial real estate and expand the types of collateral that will securitize these loans, the unseasoned nature of these loans will increase the risk that our allowance may be insufficient to absorb losses without significant additional provisions. Material additions to our allowance could materially decrease our net income. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses we will need additional provisions to replenish the allowance for loan losses. Any additional provisions will result in a decrease in net income and possibly capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our nonperforming assets increase, our earnings will be adversely affected.\nAt June 30, 2015, our nonperforming assets, which consist of nonaccruing loans and real estate owned, were $6.8 million, or 0.7% of total assets. Our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways:\n\u2022\nwe record interest income on a cash basis only for nonaccrual loans and any nonperforming investment securities and we do not record interest income for real estate owned;\n\u2022\nwe must provide for probable loan losses through a current period charge to the provision for loan losses;\n\u2022\nnoninterest expense increases when we write down the value of properties in our real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values or recognize other-than-temporary impairment on nonperforming investment securities;\n\u2022\nthere are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets, as well as carrying costs, such as taxes, insurance, and maintenance fees related to our real estate owned; and\n\u2022\nthe resolution of nonperforming assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract them from more profitable activity.\nIf additional borrowers become delinquent and do not pay their loans and we are unable to successfully manage our nonperforming assets, our losses and troubled assets could increase significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur securities portfolio may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in market value and interest rates.\nOur securities portfolio may be impacted by fluctuations in market value, potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income and/or earnings, both of which could adversely affect the value of our equity. Fluctuations in market value may be caused by changes in market interest rates, lower market prices for securities, and limited investor demand. Our securities portfolio is evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment, and if this evaluation shows impairment to the actual or projected cash flows associated with one or more securities, a potential loss to earnings and/or a decline in other comprehensive income may occur. There can be no assurance that declines in market value will not result in other-than-temporary impairments of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels.\nIf our real estate owned is not properly valued or declines further in value, our earnings could be reduced.\nWe obtain updated valuations in the form of appraisals and tax assessed values when a loan has been foreclosed and the property taken in as real estate owned and at certain other times during the asset\u2019s holding period. Our net book value of the loan at the time of foreclosure and thereafter is compared to the updated market value of the foreclosed property less estimated selling costs (fair value). A charge-off is recorded for any excess in the asset\u2019s net book value over its fair value. If our valuation process is incorrect, or if property values decline, the fair value of our real estate owned may not be sufficient to recover our carrying value in such assets, resulting in the need for additional charge-offs. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our real estate owned and may require us to recognize further charge-offs. Significant charge-offs to our real estate owned could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk.\nOur earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and investments and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but these changes could also affect (i) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities and (iii) the average duration of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio and other interest-earning assets. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings.\nAlthough management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations, any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Also, our interest rate risk modeling techniques and assumptions likely may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on our balance sheet. See Item 7., \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Asset and Liability Management and Market Risk,\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nDecreased volumes and lower gains on sales of mortgage loans sold could adversely impact our noninterest income.\nWe originate and sell one- to four-family mortgage loans. Our mortgage banking income is a significant portion of our noninterest income. We generate gains on the sale of one- to four-family mortgage loans pursuant to programs currently offered by Freddie Mac and other secondary market purchasers. Any future changes in their purchase programs, our eligibility to participate in such programs, the criteria for loans to be accepted or laws that significantly affect the activity of such entities could, in turn, materially adversely affect our results of operations. Further, in a rising or higher interest rate environment, our originations of mortgage loans may decrease, resulting in fewer loans that are available to be sold to investors. This would result in a decrease in mortgage banking revenues and a corresponding decrease in noninterest income. In addition, our results of operations are affected by the amount of noninterest expense associated with mortgage banking activities, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, equipment and data processing expense and other operating costs. During periods of reduced loan demand, our results of operations may be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to reduce expenses commensurate with the decline in loan originations.\nIf we are unable to effectively integrate new personnel hired to carry out our business plan our business may be adversely affected.\nWe have recently hired a number of experienced bankers, and we expect to hire additional personnel in order to successfully implement our business plan. The difficulties in hiring and training new personnel include integrating personnel with different business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures, while retaining other key employees. The process of integrating personnel could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, our operations and the loss of customers and key personnel. In addition, we may not realize expected revenue increases and other projected benefits from the increased emphasis in these areas. Any delays or difficulties\nencountered in connection with integrating and growing this portion of our operations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations or otherwise adversely affect our ability to achieve anticipated results.\nOur consideration of whole bank or branch acquisitions may expose us to financial, execution and operational risks that could adversely affect us.\nWe plan to evaluate supplementing organic growth by acquiring other financial institutions or their businesses that we believe will help us fulfill our strategic objectives and enhance our earnings. There are risks associated with this strategy, however, including the following:\n\u2022\nWe may be exposed to potential asset quality issues or unknown or contingent liabilities of the financial institutions, businesses, assets and liabilities we acquire. If these issues or liabilities exceed our estimates, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially negatively affected;\n\u2022\nOur growth initiatives may require us to recruit experienced personnel to assist in such initiatives, which will increase our compensation costs. The failure to identify, hire and retain such personnel would place significant limitations on our ability to execute our growth strategy;\n\u2022\nOur strategic efforts may divert resources or management\u2019s attention from ongoing business operations and may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny;\n\u2022\nThe acquisition of other entities generally requires integration of systems, procedures and personnel of the acquired entity into our company to make the transaction economically successful. This integration process is complicated and time consuming and can also be disruptive to the customers of the acquired business. If the integration process is not conducted successfully and with minimal effect on the acquired business and its customers, we may not realize the anticipated economic benefits of particular acquisitions within the expected time frame, and we may lose customers or employees of the acquired business. We may also experience greater than anticipated customer losses even if the integration process is successful;\n\u2022\nTo finance a future acquisition, we may borrow funds, thereby increasing our leverage and diminishing our liquidity, or raise additional capital, which could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders; and\n\u2022\nWe expect our income will increase following our acquisitions; however, we also expect our general and administrative expenses to increase.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nWe face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources. These competitors primarily include national, regional and internet banks within the various markets in which we operate. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loans, credit unions, mortgage banking finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Competitors in these nonbank sectors may have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe participate in a multiple employer defined benefit pension plan for the benefit of our employees. If we were to withdraw from this plan, or if the plan sponsor requires us to make additional contributions, we could incur a substantial expense which would negatively impact our earnings.\nWe participate in the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan for Financial Institutions, a multiple employer pension plan for the benefit of our employees. Effective February 1, 2006, we did not allow additional employees to participate in this plan. On January 31, 2010, we froze the future accrual of benefits under this plan with respect to participating employees. In connection with our decision to freeze our benefit accruals under the plan, and since then, we continue to evaluate costs associated with withdrawing from the plan. Based upon the value of the plan\u2019s assets, if we had chosen to withdraw from the plan as of June 30, 2015, we would have incurred an additional expense of up to approximately $8.6 million.\nThe actual expense that would be incurred in connection with a withdrawal from the plan is primarily dependent upon the timing of the withdrawal, the total value of the plan\u2019s assets at the time of withdrawal, general market interest rates at that time, expenses imposed on withdrawal, and other conditions imposed by Pentegra as set forth in the plan. If we choose to withdraw from the plan in the future, we could incur a substantial expense in connection with the withdrawal.\nEven if we do not withdraw from the plan, Pentegra, as sponsor of the plan, may request that we make additional contributions to the plan in excess of the contributions that we are regularly required to make, or obtain a letter of credit in favor of the plan, if our financial condition declines to the point that it triggers certain criteria contained in the plan. If we fail to make the contribution or obtain the requested letter of credit, then we may be forced to withdraw from the plan and establish a separate, single employer defined benefit plan that we anticipate would be underfunded to a similar extent as under the multiple employer plan.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions and limit our ability to get regulatory approval of acquisitions and new branches.\nThe USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions and limit our ability to get regulatory approval of acquisitions and new branch locations. Recently, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by the FDIC as insurer of our deposits, and by the DFI. As a bank holding company, First Northwest Bancorp is subject to examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve. Such regulation and supervision will govern the activities in which we may engage, primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on an institution\u2019s operations, require additional capital, reclassify assets, determine the adequacy of an institution\u2019s allowance for loan losses and determine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a material impact on us and our operations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and applicable regulations are subject to regular modification and change. Laws, rules and regulations may be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or prospects.\nWe are subject to certain risks in connection with our use of technology.\nWe rely heavily on in-house and third-party service providers for communications, information, operating and financial control systems technology, including our internet banking services and data processing systems. Any failure or interruption of these services or systems or breaches in security of these systems could result in failures or interruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan servicing and/or loan origination systems. The occurrence of any failures or interruptions may require us to identify alternative sources of such services, and we cannot assure you that we could negotiate terms that are as favorable to us, or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in our existing systems without the need to expend substantial resources, or even be able to find comparable services at all that would meet our business needs.\nWhile we have taken steps to adequately secure our computer systems, software, and networks, and assure our vendors have adequate security over technology-based systems we outsource from them, those security measures may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of a cyber attack, and therefore we may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code. A security breach could lead to the disclosure of confidential bank or customer information contained within our or our vendor's computer systems\nand networks and/or cause a significant disruption of service, which could subject us to litigation, financial losses, and reputational damage.\nOur business may be adversely affected by an increasing prevalence of fraud and other financial crimes.\nOur loans to businesses and individuals and our deposit relationships and related transactions are subject to exposure to the risk of loss due to fraud and other financial crimes. Nationally, reported incidents of fraud and other financial crimes have increased, and while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent such losses, there can be no assurance that we will not incur such losses.", "PERMNO": 15178, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "FNWB"}
