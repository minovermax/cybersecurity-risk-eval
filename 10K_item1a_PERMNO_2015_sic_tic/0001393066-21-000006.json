{"cik": "1393066", "company": "Resolute Forest Products Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-K and in other documents we file with the SEC, you should carefully consider the following factors, among others, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, future results, reputation as well as the market price of our securities. In particular, the risks described below could cause actual events to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K.\nRisks related to the COVID-19 pandemic\nThe outbreak of the pandemic caused by COVID-19 has had, and could continue to have a negative impact on financial markets, economic conditions and portions of our business. While we are unable to predict the extent, nature and duration of these impacts at this time, the global COVID-19 pandemic could negatively affect our business and results of operations, as well as the market price of our securities, in a number of ways, including the following:\n\u2022While we expect to continue to operate in all of our business segments in Canada and the U.S., we have reduced our operational footprint to levels consistent with essential or reduced needs, including the temporary idling of certain machines or facilities and implementing temporary or permanent layoffs. Further adjustments to our operational footprint, temporary or permanent, could be made as the COVID-19 pandemic situation develops.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic has already accelerated the secular demand decline for paper products like those we manufacture as widespread confinement alters consumer habits, which has had, and could continue to have an impact on pulp demand. The decline in demand and altered habits could have a permanent effect.\n\u2022Any construction slowdown in North America may result in a decline in demand for wood products. If the demand for wood products falls and we reduce harvesting and sawmill activity as a result, we could have greater difficulty obtaining the supply of timber and wood fiber required for our operations at favorable prices, or at all.\n\u2022There is lower demand for our away-from-home tissue products usually found in hotels, restaurants, schools, office buildings and other businesses or premises, and our ability to convert our tissue for the retail market may be limited.\n\u2022There is increased risk that we may not obtain raw materials, chemicals and other required supplies or services in a timely fashion and at favorable prices due to the impact of the reduced economic activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic on our suppliers, which could affect our production output and profitability.\n\u2022Additional trade restrictions or barriers could also negatively affect our supply chain as well as the sales or distribution of our products.\n\u2022The impact of the reduced economic activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers has increased our risk of credit exposure and that risk could continue to increase.\n\u2022Although the forest products industry has generally been recognized as critical or essential in locations where we operate, the current health restrictions, including social distancing measures, impact how our employees fulfill their duties, and limits the number of employees we can have at our operations, which in turn could impact our production output and costs.\n\u2022It could be difficult or costly to restart certain of our temporarily idled operations, and we could face personnel shortages if employees are no longer available or amenable to return to work.\n\u2022Should certain employees become ill from COVID-19 or unable to work, the attention of our management team could be diverted and our operations could be affected.\n\u2022The reduced operations and staffing at our facilities, remote working conditions and increased risk of obtaining supplies or services could increase the risk of non-compliance and incidents.\nIf necessary, to preserve liquidity, we could suspend or defer capital projects, as well as other strategic initiatives. Strategies to increase earnings power or generate additional cash flow, including acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions could be delayed or not materialize given the current economic uncertainty. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we could decide to permanently shut down machines or facilities and be required to record significant closure costs, remediation costs, long-lived asset impairment or accelerated depreciation charges.\nThe economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing decline in financial market returns and low-interest rate environment could continue to result in an increase in the amount by which our pension plans are underfunded by the next measurement date at year-end. This could result in a significant increase in the amount of our required future pension contributions, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIf we do not generate enough cash to fund our short-term or long-term obligations, we may have to draw further on our credit facilities to meet our obligations or seek additional sources of liquidity. The economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and any downgrade of our credit ratings could lead to greater difficulty in obtaining additional financing on favorable terms.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, including related governmental responses and economic impacts, market disruptions and changes in consumer habits, has heightened the risks and uncertainties described in the risk factors below, and should be read in conjunction therewith.\nStrategic Risks\nStrategic risks relate to our future business plans and strategies, including the risks associated with the global macro-environment in which we operate, trends in our industry, demand for our products, competitive threats, product innovation, public policy developments, changes to consumption habits, resource allocation, and strategic initiatives, including mergers and acquisitions, dispositions, and restructuring activity.\nDevelopments in non-print media and changes in consumer habits regarding the use of paper are expected to continue to adversely affect the demand for some of our key products.\nTrends in non-print media are expected to continue to adversely affect demand for traditional print media, including our papers, and our customers\u2019 products. Neither the timing nor the extent of these trends can be predicted with certainty. Our newspaper, magazine, book and catalog publishing customers could increase their use of, and compete with, non-print media, including multimedia technologies, electronic storage and communication platforms such as websites and social media, which could further reduce their consumption of newsprint, commercial printing papers or other products we manufacture, including market pulp. The demand for our paper products has weakened significantly over the past decade. This situation has accelerated since the COVID-19 pandemic as confinement and work from home has altered consumer habits, which could become permanent and also impact the demand for pulp. For example, over the 10 years ended December 31, 2020, according to industry statistics, North American newsprint demand fell by 69%, and fell by 26% in 2020.\nWe face intense competition in the forest products industry.\nWe compete with numerous forest products companies, some of which have greater financial resources. The trend toward consolidation in the forest products industry has led to the formation of sizable global producers that have greater flexibility in pricing and financial resources for marketing, investment, research and development, innovation, and expansion. Because the markets for our products are highly competitive, actions by competitors can affect our ability to compete and the volatility of prices at which our products are sold.\nThe forest products industry is capital intensive, and we require significant investment to remain competitive. Some of our competitors may be lower-cost producers in some of the businesses in which we operate. For example, the sizable low-cost hardwood and softwood grade pulp capacity in South America, which continues to grow as a result of ongoing investment and whose costs are thought to be very competitive, and the actions those mills take to gain market share, could continue to adversely affect our competitive position in similar grades. This in turn could impact our sales and cash flows, and push us to consider significant capital investments to remain competitive. Failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to offer products certified to globally recognized forestry management and chain of custody standards or meet customers\u2019 product specifications, it could adversely affect our ability to compete.\nBased on market interest, we offer a number of our products, including pulp and paper, wood and tissue, with specific designations to one or more globally recognized forest management and chain of custody standards as well as product specifications to meet customers\u2019 requirements. Our ability to conform to new or existing guidelines for certification depends on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as: changes to the standards or the interpretation or the application of the standards; the collaboration of our suppliers in timely sharing product information; the adequacy of government-implemented conservation measures; and the existence of territorial disputes between Indigenous peoples and governments. If we are unable to offer certified products, or to meet commitments to supply certified product or meet the product specifications of our customers, it could adversely affect the marketability of our products and our ability to compete with other producers.\nWe may not be successful in implementing our strategies to increase earnings power.\nOur corporate strategy is focused on continuing to transform the Company away from mature product markets and products in structurally declining demand toward a more profitable and sustainable organization over the long run. This includes maximizing value generation from structurally declining paper, growing in pulp and wood products, integrating our pulp into value-added quality tissue, and investing in product innovation, while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation.\nThe implementation of our corporate strategy is subject to uncertainty and could require significant capital investments. In addition, strategic initiatives could have unintended consequences, including, for example, a loss of certain pulp customers if our tissue segment becomes competitive with tissue products sold by those customers.\nAs part of our corporate strategy, we pursue acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions and projects to complement, expand or optimize our business, such as our entry into wood manufacturing in the U.S., and tissue production and sales. In connection with any acquisition, divestiture, strategic transaction or project, we may not successfully integrate an acquired business, assets, technologies, processes, controls, policies, and operations with ours or realize some or all of the anticipated benefits and synergies of the acquisition, divestiture, strategic transaction or project. In connection with such transactions, we may face challenges associated with entering into a new market, production location, product category, or meeting customers\u2019 demands. We may also face issues with the separation of processes and loss of synergies following the divestiture of businesses. In addition, we may not be able to successfully negotiate potential acquisitions, divestitures, strategic transactions or projects that we identify, or may not be able to obtain financing that may be needed. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, and substantial goodwill. The negotiation of any transaction and its completion may be complex, costly, and time consuming. To the extent we are unsuccessful in implementing our corporate strategy or our efforts do not achieve the anticipated outcomes, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nChanges in the political or economic conditions in the U.S., Canada or other countries in which we sell our products could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe manufacture products in the U.S. and Canada, and we sell products throughout the world. The economic and political policies of each country and region have a significant impact on our costs and the prices of, and demand for, our products. Changes in regional economies and economic policies can affect demand for our products, manufacturing and distribution costs, pricing, sales volume, and the availability or cost of insurance. These changes, in turn, can affect our results of operations. Changes to regional economies and economic policies that can bring about such effects include, among others, changes in the terms of, or countries that are parties to, bilateral and multi-lateral trade agreements and arrangements, limitations on the ability of potential customers to import products or obtain foreign currency for payment of imported products, and political and economic instability, including pandemics, significant civil unrest, acts of war or terrorist activities, or unstable or unpredictable governments in countries in which we operate or trade.\nOur business is subject to global economic conditions and is highly cyclical; soft conditions could cause a number of the risks we face to increase in likelihood, magnitude and duration.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. During periods of weak or weakening global economic conditions, we would expect any increase in unemployment or lower gross domestic product growth rates to adversely affect demand for our products as our customers delay or reduce their expenditures. For example, during an economic downturn, end consumers may reduce newspaper and magazine subscriptions as a direct result of their financial circumstances, contributing to lower demand for our products by our customers. Advertising demand in printed magazines and newspapers may also decline. Lower demand for print advertisements leads to fewer or smaller pages in, and may lead to less frequent publication of, printed newspapers, magazines and other advertisement circulars and periodicals, decreasing the demand for our products. In addition, demand for our market pulp products is generally associated with the production rates of paper producers, as well as consumption trends for products such as tissue, toweling and absorbent products.\nAn economic downturn in the U.S. or Canada could also negatively affect the U.S. or Canadian housing industry, which is a significant driver of demand for our lumber and other wood-based products. For example, a decline in housing starts or in the repair and remodeling segment could create a low level of primary demand for our lumber and other wood-based products, which we would expect to result in our wood products business operating at a lower level until there is a meaningful recovery in new residential construction demand or in the repair and remodeling sector. In addition, with less lumber demand, sawmills could generate fewer wood chips that we use in our pulp and paper mills, which could lead those mills to increase their supply from the open market, where prices can fluctuate with market conditions. We could also have less wood residue to use internally, which would increase our fossil fuel consumption and, as a result, our costs and environmental impact.\nThe forest products industry is also highly cyclical. The overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture, and consequently, our sales and profitability, reflect fluctuations in levels of end user demand. As described above, end user demand depends at least in part on general economic conditions in North America and the world, and the effect can be significant. In addition to end user demand, we have experienced cyclical changes in prices, sales volume and margins for our commodity products as a result of changing market trends and the effect of capacity fluctuations on supply and demand as well as the relative competitiveness of producers. Because our commodity products have few distinguishing qualities from producer to producer, competition is based mainly on price, which is determined by supply relative to demand, which is in turn affected by the factors described above.\nOperational Risks\nOperational risks arise from external events, processes, people and systems that affect the operation of our businesses. These include risks affecting, among other things, marketing and sales, woodlands management, production, supply chains, information management, data protection and security, including cybersecurity, human resources, and reputation.\nOur manufacturing businesses may have difficulty obtaining timber or wood fiber at favorable prices, or at all.\nWood fiber is the principal raw material we use in our business. We primarily use wood chips and logs for our pulp, tissue, and paper mills. Our wood products business is also dependent on our timber supply.\nWe depend heavily on harvesting rights and timber supply guarantees over government-owned land in Ontario and Quebec, respectively. The volume of harvest permitted under these licenses is subject to limits, which are generally referred to as the annual allowable cut (or, \u201cAAC\u201d). The AAC is reviewed regularly, typically every five years in Quebec and every 10 years in Ontario. The next AAC revision in Quebec is scheduled to take place in 2023 while Ontario is completing AAC revisions in 2021 for the forests in which we operate. About 25% of the total allowable harvesting rights in Quebec are allocated through an open auction system. The prices generated by the auction system are used to set pricing for the remainder of the AAC.\nIn addition, regulatory developments, activist campaigns and litigation advanced by Indigenous groups or other stakeholders have caused, and may cause in the future, significant reductions in the amount of timber available for commercial harvest in Canada, or that meet standards required for third-party certifications. Future regulation, particularly by Ontario, Quebec, or the federal Canadian government, as well as litigation, changes in forest management certification standards, and actions taken by activists to influence the availability of timber for commercial harvest could focus on any one or more of the use of timberlands, forest management practices, forest management and chain of custody certification standards, consultation with Indigenous groups, protection of habitats and endangered or other species, including the woodland caribou, promotion of forest biodiversity, and the response to, and prevention of, catastrophic wildfires.\nIncreased pressures on the Canadian provincial and federal governments to increase the protection of the woodland caribou, its habitat, and the boreal forest, could impact timber supply. For example, regulations relating to habitats, and endangered or other species could significantly reduce timber supply to our mills. Our access to timber may also be affected by factors such as fire and fire prevention, insect infestation, disease, ice storms, wind storms, drought, flooding, and other natural and man-made causes, which could potentially reduce supply and increase prices.\nThough timber is our primary source of fiber, wood fiber is a commodity and we also buy a significant portion of our fiber requirements on the open market. Prices for wood fiber are cyclical and subject to market influences, which could be concentrated in one or more regions due to market shifts. The timber requirements for our U.S. sawmills are met mostly by purchasing timber from timberland owners.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of timber or wood fiber at favorable prices for any of the reasons described above, our business operation could be materially and adversely affected.\nA sustained increase in the cost of purchased energy and other raw materials would lead to higher manufacturing costs, which could reduce our margins.\nOur operations consume large amounts of energy, such as electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, and wood residue, a substantial proportion of which we buy on the open market. The main raw materials we require in our manufacturing processes are wood fiber and chemicals. The prices for raw materials and energy are volatile and may change rapidly, which impacts our manufacturing costs, directly affects our results of operations and may contribute to earnings volatility.\nFor our commodity products, the relationship between industry supply and demand, rather than changes in the cost of raw materials, determines our ability to increase prices. Consequently, we may be unable to pass along increases in our operating costs to our customers. Any sustained increase in energy, chemical, or raw material prices without any corresponding increase\nin product pricing would reduce our operating margins and potentially require us to limit or cease operations of one or more of our facilities.\nWe also generate electricity at our hydroelectric facilities. There can be no certainty that we will be able to maintain the water rights necessary for our hydroelectric power generating facilities, or to renew them on favorable conditions. The closure of certain machines or facilities located in Quebec could trigger the exercise of termination rights by the Quebec government under hydro water rights agreements. The amount of electricity we can generate is also subject to the volume of rain or snowfall and is therefore variable from one year to the next.\nWe are subject to physical, financial and regulatory risks associated with global, regional, and local weather conditions, and climate change.\nOur operations and the operations of our suppliers are subject to climate variations, which impact the productivity of forests, the frequency and severity of wildfires, the availability of water, the distribution and abundance of species, and the spread of disease or insect epidemics, which in turn may adversely or positively affect timber production and availability. Over the past several years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions due to natural and man-made causes have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, hailstorms, wildfires, drought, flooding, snow, ice storms, the spread of disease, and insect infestations. Any of these natural disasters could also affect woodlands or cause variations in the cost of raw materials, such as virgin fiber. Changes in precipitation could make wildfires more frequent or more severe, and could adversely affect timber harvesting or our hydroelectric production. The effects of global, regional, and local weather conditions, and climate change, including the costs of complying with evolving climate change regulations and transition costs relating to a low carbon economy could also adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe could experience disruptions in operations or increased labor costs due to labor disputes or occupational health and safety issues.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 7,100 people, of whom approximately 3,700 were represented by various unions, primarily Unifor, and the Confederation of National Trade Unions (or, the \u201cCNTU\u201d) in Canada, and predominantly by the United Steelworkers International (or, the \u201cUSW\u201d) in the U.S. In the past year, we renewed or entered into a number of agreements with unions, covering approximately 500 employees in Canada. Collective agreements covering approximately 300 employees in Canada have expired, involving certain Canadian sawmills.\nWhile we intend to renew collective agreements, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew agreements on satisfactory terms, or that we will maintain continuously satisfactory agreements with all of our unionized employees. Should we be unable to do so, it could result in strikes, work stoppages, or disturbances by affected employees, which could cause us to experience a disruption of operations and affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOccupational health and safety issues, including relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, could also cause disruptions in operations or otherwise affect labor-related costs.\nDifficulties in our employee relations or difficulties identifying, attracting, and retaining employees for work, particularly in remote locations and certain positions with specialized skills, could lead to operational disruptions or increase our costs.\nOur ability to achieve our future goals and objectives is dependent, in part, on maintaining good relations with our employees and minimizing employee turnover at our corporate offices, mills, and woodlands operations. Work stoppages, excessive employee turnover, or difficulty in attracting and retaining employees, particularly for work in remote locations and certain positions with specialized skill sets, could lead to operational disruptions or increased costs.\nDisruptions to our supply chain, operations, or the delivery of our products, could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe success of our businesses is largely contingent on the availability of, and direct access to, raw materials, as well as our ability to ship products on a timely and cost-efficient basis. As a result, any event that disrupts or limits transportation or delivery services or the operations of our suppliers could materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, our operating results depend on the continued operation of our various production facilities and our ability to complete construction and maintenance projects on schedule. Interruptions of operations at our facilities, including interruptions caused by the events described below, could materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility, or our business as a whole, during and after the period of such operational difficulties.\nOur operations, supply chain, and transportation and delivery services are subject to potential hazards, including explosions, fires, accidental release of toxic materials, severe weather and natural disasters, mechanical and power failures, structural failures at any of our dams or hydroelectric facilities, supplier disruptions, labor shortages or other difficulties, public health measures to prevent or eradicate epidemics or pandemics, transportation interruptions, remediation complications, environmental and workplace risks, and terrorist or other violent acts.\nSome of these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, equipment, or the environment, and can result in, among other things: the suspension of operations; the shutdown of affected facilities; reputational damage; the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; workers\u2019 compensation; and claims against us with respect to workplace exposure, exposure of contractors on our premises, as well as other persons located nearby.\nWe are subject to disruptions to the information technology systems used to manage our operations and other business processes, including cybersecurity and privacy incidents that could involve sensitive company, employee, customer, vendor, and shareholder information.\nWe use information technology to securely manage operations and various business functions. We rely on various technologies to process, store, and report on our business and interact with employees, customers, vendors, and shareholders. The secure and reliable processing, maintenance, and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security design and controls, and those of our third-party providers, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to interruptions, breakdowns, cyberattacks or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance, hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, as well as other disruptions. A cybersecurity breach could result in operational disruptions or the misappropriation of sensitive data or personal information and could subject us to civil and criminal penalties, litigation, or have a negative impact on our reputation. We may be required to expend capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or cyberattacks, or to remediate problems caused by such breaches, attacks, or other disruptions. We have been the subject of cyberattacks from time to time, none of which have had a material impact on our business information systems or operations. There can be no assurance that such disruptions or misappropriations and the resulting repercussions will not negatively impact our cash flows and materially affect our results of operations or financial condition. Recent developments in cybersecurity and privacy legislation in different jurisdictions are imposing additional obligations on us and could expand our potential liability in the event of a cybersecurity or privacy incident.\nWe are currently transitioning from certain legacy system applications, and during the transition, such legacy systems may be more vulnerable to attack or failure and implementation of the transition may cause disruptions to our business information systems.\nWe are currently in the process of replacing certain legacy system applications with an integrated business management software platform. Prior to the completion of this upgrading process, we may not have supplier or third-party support for legacy systems in the event of failure or required updates, and such legacy systems may be more vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, and random attack. Prior to the completion of this upgrading process, we may also experience difficulties maintaining or replacing the hardware infrastructure required to operate these legacy systems. Such legacy systems, if not properly functioning prior to their replacement, could adversely affect our business.\nDuring the process of replacing legacy systems, we could experience disruptions to our business information systems and normal operating processes because of the projects\u2019 complexity. The potential adverse consequences could include delays, loss of information, decreased management reporting capabilities, damage to our ability to process transactions, harm to our control environment, diminished employee productivity, business interruptions, and unanticipated increases in costs. Further, our ability to achieve anticipated operational benefits from new platforms is not assured.\nNegative publicity, even if unjustified, could have a negative impact on our brand and the marketability of our products.\nWe believe that we have established a reputation for transparent communications, social and corporate governance, responsible forestry practices, and overall sustainability leadership. We also believe that our commitment to sustainable and responsible forestry practices extends well beyond strict compliance with applicable forestry regulations, which in Quebec and Ontario are already among the most, if not the most, rigorous in the world. Negative publicity, whether or not justified, relating to our operations and our business could tarnish our reputation or reduce the value of our brand and market demand for our products. In addition, the actions of activists, whether or not justified, could impede or delay our ability to access raw materials or obtain third-party certifications with respect to forest management and chain of custody standards that we seek in order to supply certified products to our customers. In these cases, we may have to incur significant expenses and dedicate additional resources to defend ourselves against activist campaigns, rebuild our reputation, and restore the value of our brand.\nFinancial Risks\nFinancial risks relate to our ability to meet financial obligations and mitigate exposure to broad market risks, including: volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, capital structure, as well as credit and liquidity risk, including risk related to cash management, extension of credit, collections, credit ratings, and availability and cost of funding.\nCurrency fluctuations can adversely affect our competitive position, selling prices, manufacturing costs, and net monetary items.\nWe compete with producers from around the world, particularly North America, Europe, and South America, in most of our product lines, with the exception of wood products and tissue, where we compete primarily with other North American producers. We sell our products mainly in transactions denominated in U.S. dollars, but we also sell in certain local currencies, including the Canadian dollar, the euro, and the pound sterling. Changes in the relative strength or weakness of these currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar, could affect international trade flows of these products. A stronger U.S. dollar might attract imports, thereby increasing product supply and possibly creating downward pressure on prices. On the other hand, a weaker U.S. dollar might encourage U.S. exports but also increase manufacturing costs in Canadian dollars.\nWe are particularly sensitive to changes in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. The actual impact of these changes depends primarily on the proportion of our production and sales that occur in Canada, the proportion of our financial assets and liabilities denominated in Canadian dollars, and the magnitude, direction and duration of changes in the exchange rate. We expect exchange rate fluctuations to continue to impact costs and revenues, but we cannot predict the magnitude or direction of this effect for any period, and there can be no assurance of any future effects. In 2019 and 2020, the Canadian dollar fluctuated between a low of US$1.27 in December of 2020 and a high of US$1.45 in March of 2020. Based on operating projections for 2021, if the Canadian dollar strengthens by one cent against the U.S. dollar, we expect that it will decrease our annual operating income by approximately $16 million, and vice versa.\nFurthermore, certain monetary assets and liabilities, including a substantial portion of our net pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and our net deferred income tax assets, and certain of our indebtedness, including the Quebec secured term loan facility (or, the \u201cLoan Facility\u201d) are denominated in Canadian dollars. As a result, our earnings and the amounts borrowable under our Loan Facility can be subject to the potentially significant effect of foreign exchange gains or losses in respect of these Canadian dollar net monetary items. A fluctuation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar in any given period would generally cause a foreign exchange gain or loss or change in the effective availability of the Loan Facility.\nThe amount by which our pension plans are underfunded could increase the level of required contributions, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had net pension obligations of $1,440 million, of which approximately 78% relates to our registered pension plans in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario, and approximately 22% of which relates to our U.S. qualified pension plan. See Note 16, \u201cPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans,\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements, for a description of our pension plan funding obligations, including our unfunded pension obligations.\nThe amount by which our pension plans are funded or underfunded varies depending upon the return on pension fund investments, the level of interest rates used to determine minimum funding levels, the payments of benefits, and other actuarial assumptions and experience. Variations from our assumptions would cause the actual amount of our required contributions to vary from our current estimates. Any additional contributions to our pension plans to fund potential deficit increases would be required to be paid over a period of time ranging from seven to 11 years depending upon the laws applicable to the funding of the specific pension plan. Any change to laws and regulations applicable to the funding of our pension plans could also increase or decrease our future funding obligations. Similarly, because we make our Quebec and Ontario pension plan contributions in Canadian dollars, the amount of our contributions as stated in U.S. dollars can be subject to the potentially significant effect of foreign currency exchange rate variations. Any such variations could materially affect our cash flows and financial condition, in each case either positively or negatively depending on the direction and magnitude of the variation. In addition, an increase in our net pension obligations could make it more difficult to obtain financing on favorable terms.\nIt is also possible that regulators, including Canadian provincial pension regulators, could attempt to compel additional funding of certain of our pension plans, including our Canadian registered pension plans, in respect of plan members associated with sites we formerly operated. On June 12, 2012, we filed a motion for directives with the Quebec Superior Court, the court with jurisdiction in the creditor protection proceedings under the Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada) (or, the \u201cCCAA Creditor Protection Proceedings\u201d), seeking an order to prevent pension regulators in each of Quebec, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador from declaring partial wind-ups of pension plans relating to employees of former operations in\nNew Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador, or a declaration that any claim for accelerated reimbursements of deficits arising from a partial wind-up is a barred claim under the CCAA Creditor Protection Proceedings. A partial wind-up would likely shorten the period in which any deficit within those plans, which could reach up to C$150 million ($118 million), would have to be funded if we do not obtain the relief sought. At this time, we cannot estimate the additional contributions, if any, that may be required in future years, but they could be material.\nOur operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to maintain adequate capital resources to provide for all of our capital requirements.\nOur businesses are capital intensive and require regular capital expenditures in order to maintain our equipment, increase our operating efficiency, comply with environmental laws, and innovate to remain competitive. If our available cash resources and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to fund our operating needs, make pension contributions, and finance our working capital, capital expenditures, and duty cash deposits, we would either need to borrow or reduce or delay capital expenditures. If we cannot maintain or upgrade our equipment as required, we may become unable to manufacture products that compete effectively. An inability to make required capital expenditures in a timely fashion could also have a material adverse effect on our growth, business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe terms of our ABL Credit Facility, our Senior Secured Credit Facility, the indenture governing our 2026 Notes and our Loan Facility could restrict our current and future operations, and changes relating to LIBOR could impact our borrowings under some of these facilities.\nThe credit agreements governing our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (or, the \u201cABL Credit Facility\u201d), our senior secured credit facility (or, the \u201cSenior Secured Credit Facility\u201d), the indenture governing our 4.875% senior notes due 2026 (or, the \u201c2026 Notes\u201d), and our Loan Facility contain certain restrictive covenants that impose operating, borrowing, and financial restrictions on us and could limit our ability to engage in activities that might be in our long-term best interests. For a description of our ABL Credit Facility, Senior Secured Credit Facility, the indenture governing the 2026 Notes and the Loan Facility, including the covenants and restrictions they contain, see Note 15, \u201cLong-Term Debt,\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nA breach of the covenants under the ABL Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the 2026 Notes or the Loan Facility could result in an event of default, which could allow holders and lenders, as the case may be, to accelerate the repayment of their debt and could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. An event of default under the ABL Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Credit Facility or the Loan Facility would also allow the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit to us under those facilities. If we were unable to repay amounts due and payable under the ABL Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Credit Facility or the Loan Facility, the lenders would have the right to proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness. In any of these events, we may seek to refinance our indebtedness, but be unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms. As a result, we could be: limited in how we conduct our business; unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities; or forced to sell assets.\nIn addition, our borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility and the Senior Secured Credit Facility bear interest at variable rates, primarily based on LIBOR as the reference. LIBOR is subject to national and international proposals for reform that may cause LIBOR to cease to exist after 2021 or to perform differently than in the past. While we expect that reasonable alternatives to LIBOR will be available, we cannot predict the consequences and timing of the development of alternative reference rates, and the transition to an alternative reference rate could result in an increase in our interest expense.\nWe may be subject to losses that might not be covered in whole or in part by our insurance coverage.\nWe maintain property, business interruption, credit, general liability, casualty, and other types of insurance, including environmental liability, that we believe are in accordance with customary industry practices, but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards inherent in our business, including losses resulting from human error, cybersecurity issues, natural disasters, war risks, or terrorist acts. As is typical in the industry, we also do not maintain insurance for any loss to our access to standing timber from natural disasters, regulatory changes, or other causes. Changes in insurance market conditions have caused, and may in the future cause, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies to increase substantially and in some instances, for certain insurance to become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, we might not be able to finance the amount of the uninsured liability on terms acceptable to us or at all, and might be obligated to divert a significant portion, or all, of our cash flow from normal business operations.\nWe could be required to curtail production, shut down machines or facilities, restructure operations, or sell non-core assets, which could result in recording significant additional closure costs and long-lived asset impairment or accelerated depreciation charges.\nAs part of our transformation strategy, and in response to changing market dynamics and structurally declining demand for some of our products, it may be necessary to further curtail production, permanently shut down machines and facilities, restructure operations, or sell non-core assets. In addition to the potential loss of production, curtailments and shutdowns could result in asset or goodwill impairments, accelerated depreciation, and closure costs for the affected facilities, including restructuring charges, exit or disposal costs, and remediation and other environmental costs, which could negatively impact our cash flows and materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. The closure of machines or facilities could also trigger the payment of severance, additional pension contributions, or wind-up deficiencies.\nLosses related to the impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used are recognized when circumstances, such as continuing losses or demand declines in certain businesses, indicate the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable. When indicators that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable are triggered, we evaluate the carrying value of the asset group in relation to its expected undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying value of an asset group is greater than the expected undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the asset group, an impairment charge is recognized based on the excess of the asset group\u2019s carrying value over its fair value. If it is determined that the carrying value of an asset group is recoverable, we review and adjust, as necessary, the estimated useful lives of the assets in the group. If there were to be a triggering event, it is possible that we could record significant non-cash long-lived asset impairment or accelerated depreciation charges in future periods, which would be recorded as operating expenses and would negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe also may be disposing of assets or businesses and be required to recognize additional impairment charges based on the excess of the asset group\u2019s carrying value over the expected net proceeds from the sale, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could be required to record goodwill impairment charges on all or a significant amount of the goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe have goodwill of $31 million recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020, all of which arose from our acquisition of the U.S. Sawmill Business. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the estimated fair values of identifiable tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business. Future acquisitions that we make may also result in significant amounts of additional goodwill. The determination of goodwill involves significant judgment and assumptions including the assessment of the results of the most recent fair value calculations, the identification of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, specific events affecting us and the business, and making the assessment on whether each relevant factor will impact the impairment test positively or negatively, and the magnitude of any such impact. The carrying value of goodwill is not amortized, and is tested for impairment at the reporting unit\u2019s level annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment loss. In the event that the net carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit\u2019s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit.\nWe could be required to record additional valuation allowances against our recorded deferred income tax assets.\nWe recorded significant deferred income tax assets relating to our Canadian operations in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020. If, in the future, we determine that we are unable to recognize these deferred income tax assets as a result of sustained cumulative losses in our Canadian operations, we could be required to record additional valuation allowances for the portion of the deferred income tax assets that is not more likely than not to be realized. Such valuation allowances, if taken, would be recorded as a charge to income tax provision and would adversely impact our results of operations.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\nLegal and compliance risks arise from governmental and regulatory action, operations and business conduct, and contractual and other legal liabilities, including risks associated with: international trade regulation; legal proceedings; our shareholder relationships; commitments to customers, suppliers or other stakeholders; and compliance with securities, governance and other laws and regulations, policies and procedures, such as those relating to financial reporting and disclosure obligations, the environment, forest management, health and safety, marketing, product safety and liability, and privacy and antitrust. Governmental and regulatory risk includes the risk that government or regulator actions will impose additional costs on us or cause us to have to change our operations and business models or practices.\nProducts we produce in one country and export to another may become subject to duties or other international trade remedies or restrictions.\nWe produce products in the U.S. and Canada, and we sell products worldwide. Under international agreements and the domestic trade laws of many countries, trade remedies are available to domestic industries where imports are alleged to be \u201cdumped\u201d or \u201csubsidized\u201d and such imports are alleged to cause material injury, or an imminent threat of injury, to a domestic industry. Under such laws, dumping generally involves selling for export a product at a price lower than that at which the same or similar product is sold in the home market of the exporter, or where the export prices are lower than a value that typically must be at or above the full cost of production (including sales and marketing costs) and a reasonable amount for profit. International trade laws also generally provide that subsidies from governments may be subject to trade remedies under certain circumstances. A trade remedy investigation or proceeding may involve allegations of either dumping, subsidization, or both. Where injurious dumping is found, the trade remedy is typically an anti-dumping duty order. Where injurious subsidization is found, the trade remedy is typically a countervailing duty order. In principle, a duty equal to the amount of dumping or subsidization, as applicable, should be imposed on the importer of the product. However, whether or not consistent with treaty obligations or other applicable law, authorities have imposed assumed or estimated rates on products that may not be related to actual dumping by a particular producer or may not be based on subsidies actually received by the producer. Anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders do not prevent the export or import of the product, but rather require the importer of the product to pay to the government an anti-dumping duty or countervailing duty, or a deposit on estimated anti-dumping duties or countervailing duties, as applicable. The imposition of additional anti-dumping duties, countervailing duties, deposit requirements in respect of estimated duties, or any other trade remedy on one or more of our products could materially affect our cash flow, and the competitive position of our operations relating to the affected product.\nIn addition to risks related to the trade remedies discussed above, a country could impose taxes or tariffs on some or all imported products, whether or not consistent with existing trade treaties or agreements, and trade treaties, agreements and arrangements may be renegotiated or terminated, or one or more countries that are parties may withdraw. Such actions with respect to trade treaties, agreements, or arrangements taken by any country where we sell our products internationally, could materially affect our cash flow, and the competitive position of our operations relating to the affected products.\nWe are subject to countervailing and anti-dumping duty orders on the vast majority of our U.S. imports of softwood lumber products produced at our Canadian sawmills, which could materially affect our operations and cash flows.\nThe vast majority of our U.S. imports of softwood lumber products produced at our Canadian sawmills are subject to orders requiring us to pay cash deposits to the U.S. for estimated countervailing and anti-dumping duties. These cash deposit requirements are the result of petitions filed by U.S. softwood lumber products producers and forest landowners with the U.S. Department of Commerce (or, \u201cCommerce\u201d) and the U.S. International Trade Commission.\nNo such deposits paid to the U.S. will be converted into actual countervailing duties or anti-dumping duties unless and until all appeals of final determinations and orders have been exhausted. We requested and participated in the first and second administrative reviews and could remain subject to annual administrative reviews for five or more years following the initial Commerce orders.\nWe have been required to pay cash deposits for estimated countervailing duties and anti-dumping duties on the vast majority of our U.S. imports of softwood lumber products produced at our Canadian sawmills, since April 28, 2017, and June 30, 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the rates for such estimated countervailing and anti-dumping duties were 14.70% and 3.20%, respectively. Commerce issued its final results in the countervailing duties first administrative review on December 1, 2020 and its final results in the anti-dumping first administrative review on November 30, 2020 and established our new rates at 19.10% for countervailing duties and 1.15% for anti-dumping duties. These rates will apply until Commerce sets new duty rates in subsequent administrative reviews, or new rates may be set through a remand determination by a United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement binational panel (or, \u201cPanel\u201d) on appeal. Through December 31, 2020, our aggregate cash deposits paid to the U.S. for all affected products totaled $243 million.\nWe cannot provide any assurance regarding the estimated or final duty rates that may be determined by Commerce in its future administrative reviews. During any period in which our U.S. imports of softwood lumber products from our Canadian sawmills are subject to countervailing or anti-dumping cash deposit requirements or duty requirements, our cash flows and the competitive position of those products and our related Canadian operations could be materially affected.\nAny failure to comply with laws and regulations could require us to incur or record additional liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of foreign, federal or national, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations dealing with financial reporting and disclosure obligations, corporate governance, antitrust, customs and trade, employees, contractors, transportation, taxes, timber and water rights, pensions, benefit plans, workplace health and safety, the manufacture and sale of consumer products, including product safety and liability, the environment, and Indigenous peoples, among others. Many of these laws and regulations are complex and subject to differing interpretation, and the requirements of laws and regulations of different countries and jurisdictions in which we operate, have sales or otherwise do business, or in which our securities trade or in which our security holders reside, may differ or be inconsistent with one another. Compliance with these laws and regulations, including changes to them or their interpretations or enforcement, or introduction of new laws and regulations, has required in the past, and could require in the future, substantial expenditures by us and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, noncompliance with laws and regulations, especially those related to the environment and Indigenous peoples, could significantly damage, and require us to spend substantial amounts of money to rebuild our reputation.\nIn addition, our ability to comply with these laws and regulations often depends, at least in part, on compliance by independent third parties, such as contractors and agents we retain to provide services. For example, our compliance with customs requirements for international shipments depends in part on compliance by our customs brokers, sureties, transportation companies, and external advisors, in addition to our own employees and consultants, and we could be liable for noncompliance by any of them, even if inadvertent. Failure to comply with laws and regulations can also be the result of unintended consequences, such as unforeseen consequences of information technology modifications, upgrades, or replacements. Although we strive to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us, no company, including ours, can assure that it will successfully prevent, detect, or remediate all potential instances of non-compliance, and any failure to do so could be material, require substantial expenditures, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs an owner of real estate and industrial facilities, we could be required to incur or record additional environmental and related health and safety liabilities.\nAs an owner and operator of real estate and industrial facilities, we are subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific laws and regulations relating to pollution and the protection of the environment, as well as several requirements stipulated in our facilities\u2019 permits, including those governing air emissions, water usage, wastewater discharges, the storage, management and disposal of regulated substances and waste, the investigation and clean-up of contaminated sites, landfill and wastewater treatment system operation and closure, forest management and operations, endangered species and their habitat, health and safety, carbon pricing and climate change. Changes to our operations and costs to comply with these laws and regulations may increase as the requirements of these laws and regulations evolve. Noncompliance with these regulations or permit conditions can result in significant civil, administrative or criminal fines or penalties, or regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations. This may include liability under environmental laws for cleanup, improvement or change of pollution control equipment, and other costs and damages, including investigation costs, tort liability and damages to natural resources, resulting from past or present spills, releases or threats of releases of regulated substances and waste on or from our current or former properties or operations. We may also be liable under health and safety laws for related exposure of employees, contractors and other persons to substances and waste on or from our current or former properties or injuries. We may incur liability under these laws without regard to whether we knew of, were responsible for, or owned the property at the time of, any exposure, spill, release or threats of releases of any regulated substances or waste on or from any current or former property, or at properties where we arranged for the disposal of regulated materials or waste. Claims or liability may also arise out of currently unknown environmental conditions, obligations arising as a result of new or revised rules or regulations (e.g. regulation of perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances, or \u201cPFAS\u201d) or aggressive enforcement efforts by government regulators, public interest groups or private parties. As a result, we may be required to incur or record additional environmental or related health and safety liabilities.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls, and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations.\nAs a result of our international sales and operations, we are required to comply with trade and economic sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the U.S., Canada, and other governments or organizations. We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (Canada), the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010 and other anti-bribery laws that generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials and, in some jurisdictions, to other commercial parties. Changes in trade sanctions laws could restrict our business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned entities, and may result in modifications to compliance programs. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in sanctions, including fines, loss of authorizations\nneeded to conduct our international business, and other penalties, as well as result in a default under certain of our financing agreements, each of which could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe are and may become a party to a number of legal proceedings, claims, governmental inquiries, investigations, and other disputes, and adverse judgments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe become involved in various legal proceedings, claims, governmental inquiries, investigations, and other disputes in the normal course of business. These could include, for example, matters related to contracts, transactions, commercial and trade disputes, taxes, environmental issues, activist damages, employment and workers\u2019 compensation claims, grievances, human rights complaints, pension and benefit plans and obligations, health and safety, product safety and liability, asbestos exposure, intellectual property, financial reporting and disclosure obligations, corporate governance, Indigenous peoples\u2019 claims, antitrust, governmental regulations, and other matters. In addition to claims against us and our consolidated subsidiaries, these matters may involve claims asserted by others against unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures in which we have an interest. Although the final outcome of these matters is subject to many variables and cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty, we regularly assess the status of the matters and establish provisions (including legal costs expected to be incurred) when we believe an adverse outcome is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal proceedings that we believe could have a material adverse effect if not resolved in our favor, or that we believe to be significant, are discussed in Item 3 of this Form 10-K and in Note 18, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies - Legal matters\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements. However, our reports do not disclose or discuss all matters of which we are aware. If our assessment of the probable outcome or materiality of a matter is not correct, we may not have made adequate provision for such loss and our financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, if a loss resulting from an adverse outcome in connection with a matter were to affect the solvency of certain of our subsidiaries or remain unpaid for certain periods, it could result in a default under the ABL Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Credit Facility, or the indenture governing the 2026 Notes and the Loan Facility. For additional information, see \u201cFinancial Risks - The terms of our ABL Credit Facility, our Senior Secured Credit Facility, the indenture governing our 2026 Notes and our Loan Facility could restrict our current and future operations, and changes relating to LIBOR could impact our borrowings under some of these facilities\u201d above.\nSome matters that we may be involved in from time to time result from claims brought by us against third parties, including customers, suppliers, shareholders, governments or governmental agencies, activists and others. Even if such a matter does not involve a claim for damages or other penalty or remedial action against us, such a matter could nevertheless adversely affect our relationships with those and other third parties.\nThere is a shareholder who owns a substantial percentage of our common stock, and its interests could differ from those of other stockholders, and its actions could affect the price of our common stock.\nThere is a shareholder who owns a substantial percentage of the outstanding shares of our common stock, and could increase its percentage ownership even further. This shareholder could be in a position to influence the outcome of actions requiring shareholder approval, including, among other things, the election of board members. The concentration of ownership could also facilitate or hinder a negotiated change of control and consequently, impact the value of our common stock. In addition, the possibility that this shareholder may sell all or a large portion of our common stock in a short period of time may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 66130, "SIC": 2621, "TIC": "RFP"}
