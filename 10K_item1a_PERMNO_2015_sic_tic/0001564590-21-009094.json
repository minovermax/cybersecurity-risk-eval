You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties summarized and described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\u2022\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has adversely affected, and is likely to continue to adversely affect, our business and operating results. Among other things, the COVID-19 global pandemic has caused, and could continue to cause, many of our customers to reduce their purchases of our products or to reduce the amount of digital advertising spend that they manage using our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition and Future Operating Results\n\u2022\nIt is difficult to predict our future operating results, in particular because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our customers and digital advertising spend.\n\u2022\nWe have a history of losses and we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\n\u2022\nWe expect to continue to incur losses and experience negative cash flows, and we will need to reduce operating expenses, sell additional securities, sell assets or borrow additional funds to continue as a going concern.\n\u2022\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\n\u2022\nWe have incurred indebtedness, which could adversely affect our ability to adjust our business to respond to competitive pressures and to obtain sufficient funds to satisfy our needs.\n\u2022\nOur Revenue Share Agreement with Google is scheduled to terminate on September 30, 2021, which could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nWe may experience quarterly fluctuations in our operating results due to a number of factors, which make our future results difficult to predict.\nRisks Related to our Business and Market\n\u2022\nIf the market for digital advertising slows or declines, our business, growth prospects, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nWe must develop and introduce enhancements and new features that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with technological developments to remain competitive in our evolving industry.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to maintain our relationships with, and access to, publishers, advertising exchange platforms and other platforms that aggregate the supply of advertising inventory, our business will suffer.\n\u2022\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our relationships with advertising agencies and our strategic relationships with third parties.\n\u2022\nOur market is highly competitive and complex. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\n\u2022\nOur business depends on our customers\u2019 continued willingness to manage advertising spend on our platform.\nOperational Risks\n\u2022\nOur business depends on retaining and attracting qualified personnel, and turnover may result in operational inefficiencies that could negatively affect our business.\n\u2022\nWe incur upfront costs associated with onboarding advertisers to our platform and may not recoup our investment if we do not maintain the advertiser relationship over time.\n\u2022\nBecause we generally bill our customers over the term of the contract, near term decline in new or renewed subscriptions may not be reflected immediately in our operating results.\n\u2022\nAny decrease in our customers\u2019 use of search advertising or our inability to further penetrate social and eCommerce advertising channels would harm our business.\n\u2022\nOur sales cycle can be long and unpredictable and require considerable time and expense, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate.\n\u2022\nOur ability to generate revenue depends on our collection of significant amounts of data from various sources.\n\u2022\nMaterial defects or errors in our software platform could harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our subscription services.\n\u2022\nWe primarily derive our revenues from a single software platform and any factor adversely affecting subscriptions to our platform could harm our business and operating results.\n\u2022\nIf mobile connected devices, their operating systems or content distribution channels, including those controlled by our competitors, develop in ways that prevent our advertising campaigns from being delivered to their users, our ability to grow our business will be impaired.\n\u2022\nIf our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to customer data or our data is otherwise obtained, our solutions may be perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our solutions and we may incur significant liabilities.\n\u2022\nWe primarily use third-party data centers to deliver our services. Any disruption of service at these facilities could harm our business.\n\u2022\nWe may need to continually improve our hosting infrastructure to avoid service interruptions or slower system performance.\n\u2022\nOur solutions must integrate with our customers\u2019 enterprise applications and infrastructures. If we cannot efficiently implement our solutions for our customers, we may lose customers.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to maintain or expand our sales and marketing capabilities, we may not be able to generate anticipated revenues.\n\u2022\nAny failure to offer high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and harm our financial results.\n\u2022\nAny failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.\nRegulatory and Compliance Risks\n\u2022\nDomestic and foreign government regulation and enforcement of data practices and data tracking technologies is expansive, not clearly defined and rapidly evolving. Such regulation could directly restrict portions of our business or indirectly affect our business by constraining our customers\u2019 use of our platform or limiting the growth of our markets.\n\u2022\nIf our customers fail to abide by applicable privacy laws or to provide adequate notice and/or obtain consent from end users, we could be subject to litigation or enforcement action or reduced demand for our services. Industry self-regulatory standards may be implemented in the future that could affect demand for our platform and our ability to access data we use to provide our platform.\n\u2022\nOur revenues may be adversely affected if we are required to charge sales taxes in additional jurisdictions or other taxes for our solutions.\n\u2022\nIf we experience material weaknesses or deficiencies in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss or research tax credit carryforwards.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\u2022\nIf we cannot meet the continued listing requirement of The Nasdaq Global Market, The Nasdaq Global Market may de-list our common stock, which would have an adverse effect on the trading volume, liquidity and market price of our common stock.\n\u2022\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations and could subject us to litigation.\n\u2022\nIf we sell additional shares of our common stock, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be diluted.\nRISK FACTORS\nRisks related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic has adversely affected and is likely to continue to adversely affect our business and operating results.\nA novel strain of coronavirus causing the disease COVID-19 emerged in China in December 2019 and began to spread globally, including to the United States, in early 2020. The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic. We believe that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have an adverse effect on many of our customers and their businesses and their spending on digital advertising and has had an adverse effect on our recent results of operations and is likely to continue to affect our future results of operations, but the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is inherently uncertain at the time of this report. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in travel restrictions, prohibitions of or restrictions on non-essential activities, disruption and shutdown of businesses and greater uncertainty in global financial markets.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will affect our business or operating results, which is highly dependent on inherently uncertain future developments, including the severity of outbreaks of COVID-19, the actions taken by governments and private businesses in relation to COVID-19 containment and the availability, deployment and efficacy of vaccines. In geographies in which we or our customers operate, health concerns and political or governmental developments in response to COVID-19 have resulted in, and could continue to result in, economic, social or labor instability or prolonged contractions in the industries in which our customers operate, slow our sales process, result in customers not purchasing or renewing subscriptions to our platform or failing to make payments, and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations and financial condition. Because our platform is offered as a subscription-based service, the effect of the pandemic may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods, if at all.\nSince mid-March 2020, some of our customers have reduced the amount of digital advertising spend that they manage using our products, which has had an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, and some of our customers have requested extended payment terms, reduced fees or fee waivers, early contract terminations and other forms of contract relief. Also, since mid-March 2020, most of our employees have not been able to work from our offices and have been working from home, which could cause some disruption or delays in our business activities, including our product development efforts. If the COVID-19 global pandemic continues for an extended period of time or evolves into a more severe worldwide health crisis it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRisks related to our Financial Condition and Future Operating Results\nIt is difficult to predict our future operating results, in particular because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our customers and digital advertising spend.\nOur ability to accurately forecast our future operating results is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including planning for and modeling future growth. We have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan our business, are incorrect or change due to industry or market developments, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer. Specifically, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally, with the United States as one of the main epicenters of the pandemic, and is significantly affecting both U.S. and worldwide economic activity. We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on many of our customers and their businesses and their spending on digital advertising and has had an adverse effect on our recent results of\noperations and is likely to continue to affect our future results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic could result in one or more of the following conditions, among other potential conditions, that could affect us and our customers:\n\u2022\nincreased risk in collectability of accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nreduced staff productivity due to working at home for extended periods;\n\u2022\nlost staff productivity due to illness and/or illness in the family;\n\u2022\nincreased customer losses/churn;\n\u2022\nincreased challenges in acquiring new customers;\n\u2022\nextreme currency exchange-rate fluctuations; and\n\u2022\nchallenges with Internet infrastructure due to high loads.\nThe duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain. We continue to monitor the effect that the COVID-19 outbreak may have, and while it is not possible at this time to estimate the ongoing impact that COVID-19 will have on our business, the continued spread of COVID-19, and the measures taken by the governments of countries affected, will likely have an adverse impact on global economic conditions, which are likely to have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe have a history of losses and we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred significant losses in each fiscal year since our incorporation in 2006. We experienced a net loss of $14.1 million and $12.4 million during the years ended 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $291.2 million. The losses and accumulated deficit were due largely to the substantial investments we made to grow our business and acquire customers. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses could increase in the future due to investments to grow our business, acquire customers and develop our platform and new functionality. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenues sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. Many of our efforts to generate revenues from our business are new and unproven and exacerbated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any failure to increase our revenues or generate revenues from new solutions or to maintain or increase revenues from existing products and customers could prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability. Our revenues have decreased in recent periods, including a decline from $49.0 million in 2019 to $30.0 million in 2020. We do not expect to be profitable in 2021 on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to attain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis, or if we do, that we will sustain profitability.\nWe expect to continue to incur losses and experience negative cash flows, and we will need to reduce operating expenses, sell additional securities, sell assets or borrow additional funds to continue as a going concern.\nWe currently operate at a loss and we anticipate that we will continue to have operating losses in the near term. Our business has not generated enough cash flow to fund our sales and marketing activities, research and development initiatives and other business activities. We anticipate that increasing our market share for our current services through sales and marketing efforts, continuing development of new platform features and delivering efficient service to customers will require additional capital and expenditures and will be made more challenging given the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. If we continue to burn cash without a corresponding increase to revenue, we will need to reduce operating expenses through successful cost-cutting measures or seek to sell additional securities, sell assets or borrow additional funds to continue as a going concern. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully reduce our operating expenses through successful cost-cutting measures. Further, there is no guarantee that we will receive forgiveness of any amount of our loan under the Paycheck Protection Program or that we will be able to issue additional securities or sell assets in future periods or borrow additional funds on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, in order to meet our cash needs. Our ability to raise additional financing is subject to a number of uncertainties, including but not limited to, the market demand for our stock, our financial performance and outlook, the market demand for products and services, negative economic developments, the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and adverse market conditions. During 2020, we commenced a restructuring plan that included a global reduction-in-force and other cost saving actions to reduce our operating expenses and address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, or the 2020 Restructuring Plan. The 2020 Restructuring Plan is expected to ultimately result in the reduction of our global workforce by approximately 60 employees, approximately half of which are located outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2020, the majority of the planned reductions were complete. Our ability to continue as a going concern is substantially dependent upon our ability to improve customer retention rates, increase new bookings, and manage our cash flows. Other factors that may significantly affect our ability to continue as a going concern include one or more of the following; our ability to obtain partial forgiveness of our loan under the Paycheck Protection Program, our ability to renew our revenue sharing agreement with Google on acceptable terms, our ability to raise additional financing, and our ability to further reduce our expenses.\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features or enhance our existing platform, continue the deployment of MarinOne, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or\nconvertible debt securities our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Through December 31, 2020, we sold 3.4 million shares of our common stock under an equity distribution agreement with JMP Securities LLC, or JMP Securities, and received proceeds of approximately $9.4 million, net of offering costs of $0.6 million, at a weighted-average sales price of $2.90. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 2.7 million shares of our common stock under the equity distribution agreement, and received proceeds of approximately $7.5 million, net of offering costs of $0.5 million, at a weighted average sales price of $2.92 per share. The 2.7 million shares of our common stock that we issued under the equity distribution agreement during 2020 increased the number of outstanding shares of our common stock by approximately 40%, resulting in dilution to the percentage ownership of our previously existing stockholders. During February 2021 we sold an additional 1.2 million shares of our common stock under the equity distribution agreement and received proceeds of $3.1 million, net of offering costs of $0.1 million, at a weighted average sales price of $2.68 per share. There are currently no additional amounts available to be sold under this equity distribution agreement, but we intend to explore other options to raise additional financing.\nIn May 2020, we entered into a loan agreement with Harvest Small Business Finance, LLC, or the Lender, as the lender for a loan in an aggregate principal amount of $3.3 million, or the Loan, pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Any additional debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired.\nWe have incurred indebtedness, which could adversely affect our ability to adjust our business to respond to competitive pressures and to obtain sufficient funds to satisfy our needs.\nIn May 2020, we obtained the Loan pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program pursuant to the CARES Act. The Loan matures two years from the date of first disbursement of the Loan, which occurred on May 7, 2020. The Loan bears interest at a rate of 1% per annum, with all payments deferred through the ten-month anniversary of the date of the note evidencing the Loan, or the Note. Principal and interest are payable monthly commencing on the first day of the next month after the expiration of the initial ten-month deferment period and may be prepaid by us at any time prior to maturity without penalty. The Note specifies various potential defaults, upon the occurrence of which, at the Lender\u2019s option, amounts outstanding under the Note would become immediately due and payable.\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury, or the Treasury, and the U.S. Small Business Administration, or the SBA, have announced that they will review all Payroll Protection Program loans that equal or exceed $2.0 million. Guidance from Treasury and SBA has been slow to develop and occasionally unclear. At the same time, the Payroll Protection Program has been amended multiple times with some amendments significantly altering the timeline associated with the Payroll Protection Program spending and Loan forgiveness. While we believe that we acted in good faith and complied with all requirements of the Payroll Protection Program, if Treasury or SBA determined that our Loan application was not made in good faith or that the we did not otherwise meet the eligibility requirements of the Payroll Protection Program, we may not receive forgiveness of the Loan (in whole or in part) and we could be required to return the Loan or a portion thereof. Further, there is no guarantee that we will receive forgiveness for any amount and forgiveness will be subject to review by the Lender of information and documentation that we submit, as required by SBA and the Lender.\nWe intend to apply for forgiveness of approximately $2.9 million due under the Loan once the Lender opens the application process, with the amount of potential Loan forgiveness being calculated in accordance with the requirements of the PPP based on payroll costs, any mortgage interest payments, any covered rent payments and any covered utilities payments during the 8-week period beginning on the date of first disbursement of the Loan. No assurances can be provided as to the amount or timing of any potential Loan forgiveness. Any required repayment of our existing indebtedness as a result of a default would reduce our cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur Revenue Share Agreement with Google is scheduled to terminate on September 30, 2021, which could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition.\nWe entered into a revenue share agreement with Google in December 2018, with an effective date of October 1, 2018, or the Google Revenue Share Agreement. Under the Google Revenue Share Agreement, we are eligible to receive both fixed and variable revenue share payments based on a percentage of the search advertising spend that is managed through our platform. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenues of $9.1 million, and for the year ended December 31, 2019 we recognized revenues of $12.2 million from the Google Revenue Share Agreement. The Google Revenue Share Agreement is scheduled to terminate on September 30, 2021. We are in preliminary discussions with Google to extend potentially the term of the Google Revenue Share Agreement, but no assurances can be provided as to whether the term will be extended or as to terms of any extension\nof the agreement. Our results of operations would be adversely affected if the Google Revenue Share Agreement is terminated, either upon its scheduled termination or otherwise, or adversely modified.\nOur usage-based pricing model makes it difficult to forecast revenues from our current customers and future prospects.\nWe primarily have a usage-based pricing model in which most of our fees are calculated as a percentage of customers\u2019 advertising spend managed on our platform. This pricing model makes it difficult to accurately forecast revenues because our customers\u2019 advertising spend managed by our platform may vary from month to month based on the variety of industries in which our advertisers operate, the seasonality of those industries and fluctuations in our customers\u2019 advertising budgets or other factors. The market for digital advertising may be adversely affected by adverse market conditions, including the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused some advertisers to, and may continue to lead advertisers to, reduce the amount of their digital advertising spend. Our subscription contracts with our direct advertiser customers generally contain a minimum monthly platform fee, which is generally greater than one-half of our estimated monthly revenues from the customer at the time the contract is signed, and, as a result, the minimum monthly platform fee may not be a good indicator of our revenues from that customer. In addition, advertisers that use our platform through our agency customers typically do not have a minimum monthly spend amount or a minimum term during which they must use our platform, and as a result, our ability to forecast revenues from these advertisers is difficult. If we incorrectly forecast revenues for these advertisers and the amount of revenue is less than projections we provide to investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Additionally, if we overestimate usage, we may incur additional expenses in adding infrastructure, without a commensurate increase in revenues, which would harm our gross margins and other operating results.\nWe may experience quarterly fluctuations in our operating results due to a number of factors which make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or our guidance.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as indicative of our future performance. If our revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, or below any guidance we may provide to the market, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.\nIn addition to other risk factors listed in this section, factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include the following:\n\u2022\nthe impact of, including but not limited to, the market volatility and economic disruption caused by, COVID-19 or any other worldwide pandemic;\n\u2022\nthe level of advertising spend managed through our platform for a particular quarter;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the contractual rates of our strategic agreements with publishers;\n\u2022\ncustomer renewal rates, and the pricing and usage of our platform in any renewal term;\n\u2022\ndemand for our platform and the size and timing of our sales;\n\u2022\ncustomers delaying purchasing decisions in anticipation of new releases by us or of new products by our competitors;\n\u2022\nany termination or adverse changes in the Google Revenue Share Agreement, or any changes in any other current or future strategic agreements with publishers;\n\u2022\ndelays in projects to upgrade our own software platform infrastructure and any resulting delays in releasing new features;\n\u2022\nnetwork or system outages, platform downtime, software application or operations errors, software bugs, security breaches or other supplier system or supply chain changes or interruptions and any associated credits, warranty claims or other expenses;\n\u2022\nchanges in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors or customers;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our current and future solutions;\n\u2022\nchanges in spending on digital advertising or information technology and software by our current and/or prospective customers;\n\u2022\nbudgeting cycles of our customers;\n\u2022\ndepartures of employees or restructurings of our teams or personnel;\n\u2022\nour potentially lengthy sales cycle;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of infrastructure costs and operating expenses related to the maintenance or expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions in our domestic and international markets.\nBased upon all of the factors described above, we have a limited ability to forecast our future revenues, costs and expenses, and as a result, our operating results may from time to time fall below our estimates or the expectations of public market analysts and investors.\nRisks related to our Business and Market\nIf the market for digital advertising slows or declines, our business, growth prospects, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nThe future growth of our business could be constrained by the level of acceptance and expansion of emerging cloud-based advertising channels, as well as the continued use and growth of existing channels, such as search and social advertising. Even if these channels become widely adopted, advertisers and agencies may not make significant investments in solutions such as ours that help them manage their digital advertising spend across publisher platforms and advertising channels. It is difficult to predict customer adoption rates, customer demand for our platform, the future growth rate and size of the advertising cloud solutions market or the entry of competitive solutions. The market for digital advertising may be adversely affected by adverse market conditions, including the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused some advertisers to, and may continue to lead advertisers to, reduce the amount of their digital advertising spend. The continued expansion of the market for advertising cloud solutions depends on a number of factors, including the continued growth of the cloud-based advertising market, the growth of social and mobile as advertising channels and the cost, performance and perceived value associated with advertising cloud solutions, as well as the ability of cloud computing companies to address security and privacy concerns. Further, the cloud computing market is less developed in many jurisdictions outside the United States. If we or other cloud computing providers experience security incidents, loss of customer data, disruptions in delivery or other problems, the market for cloud computing as a whole, including our applications, may be negatively affected.\nWe operate in a rapidly developing and changing industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects.\nWe have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies in rapidly developing and changing industries, including challenges in forecasting accuracy, hiring and retaining qualified employees, determining appropriate investments of our limited resources, market acceptance of our existing and future solutions, effectively integrating acquired products, competition from established companies with greater financial and technical resources, acquiring and retaining customers, managing customer deployments, making improvements to our existing products and developing new solutions. Additionally, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have made these challenges more pronounced. Our current operations infrastructure may require changes in order for us to achieve profitability and scale our operations efficiently. For example, we may need to automate portions of our solution to decrease our costs, ensure our marketing infrastructure is designed to drive highly qualified leads cost effectively and implement changes in our sales model to improve the predictability of our sales and reduce our sales cycle. In addition, from time to time, we may need to make additional investments in product development to address market demands, which may increase our overall expenses and reduce our ability to achieve profitability. If we fail to implement these changes in a timely manner or are unable to implement them due to factors beyond our control, our business may suffer, our revenue may decline and we may not be able to achieve growth or profitability. We cannot be assured that we will be successful in addressing these and other challenges we may face in the future.\nWe must develop and introduce enhancements and new features that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with technological developments to remain competitive in our evolving industry.\nWe operate in a dynamic market characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry and legal standards. The introduction of new advertising platform solutions by our competitors, the market acceptance of solutions based on new or alternative technologies, or the emergence of new industry standards could render our platform obsolete. Our ability to compete successfully, attract new customers and increase revenues from existing customers depends in large part on our ability to enhance and improve our existing cross-channel, cross-device, enterprise marketing software platform and to continually introduce or acquire new features that are in demand by the market we serve. We also must update our software to reflect changes in publishers\u2019 application programming interfaces, or APIs, and terms of use. We are in the process of deploying our new platform, MarinOne, and the success of this project or any other enhancement or new solution depends on several factors, including timely completion, adequate quality testing, effective migration of existing customers with minimal disruption and appropriate introduction and market acceptance. Any new platform or\nfeature that we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely manner, may contain defects, may be more costly to compete than we anticipate or may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenues. If we are unable to complete the upgrade to our software platform infrastructure effectively or in a timely manner, or to anticipate or timely and successfully develop or acquire new offerings or features or enhance our existing platform to meet customer requirements, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to maintain our relationships with, and access to, publishers, advertising exchange platforms and other platforms that aggregate the supply of advertising inventory, our business will suffer.\nWe currently depend on relationships with various publishers, including Amazon, Apple, Baidu, Bing, Facebook, Google, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, Verizon Media and Yahoo!. Our subscription services interface with these publishers\u2019 platforms through APIs, such as the Google API or Facebook API. We are subject to the respective platforms\u2019 standard API terms and conditions, which govern the use and distribution of data from these platforms. Our business significantly depends on having access to these APIs, particularly the Google API, which the substantial majority of our customers use, on commercially reasonable terms and our business would be harmed if any of these publishers, advertising exchanges or aggregators of advertising inventory discontinues or limits access to their platforms, modifies their terms of use or other policies or place additional restrictions on us as API users, or charges API license fees for API access. Moreover, some of these publishers, such as Google, market competitive solutions for their platforms. Because the advertising inventory suppliers control their APIs, they may develop competitive offerings that are not subject to the limits imposed on us through the API terms and conditions. Currently, restrictions in these API agreements limit our ability to implement certain functionality, require us to implement functionality in a particular manner or require us to implement certain required minimum functionality, causing us to devote development resources to implement certain functionality that we would not otherwise include in our subscription services and to incur costs for personnel to provide services to implement functionality that we are prohibited from automating. Publishers, advertising exchanges and advertising inventory aggregators update their API terms of use from time to time and new versions of these terms could impose additional restrictions on us. In addition, publishers, advertising exchanges and advertising inventory aggregators continually update their APIs and may update or modify functionality, which requires us to modify our software to accommodate these changes and to devote technical resources and personnel to these efforts which could otherwise be used to focus on other priorities. Any of these outcomes could cause demand for our products to decrease, our research and development costs to increase, and our results of operations and financial condition to be harmed.\nWe have also entered into long-term strategic agreements with certain leading search publishers. Under these strategic agreements, we receive consideration based on a percentage of the search advertising spend that our customers manage on our platform. The majority of our strategic agreement revenue is concentrated in one revenue share agreement, executed with Google in December 2018, with an effective date of October 1, 2018, or the Google Revenue Share Agreement. Under the Google Revenue Share Agreement, we receive both fixed and variable revenue share payments based on a percentage of the search advertising spend that is managed through our platform. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenues of $9.1 million and for the year ended December 31, 2019 we recognized revenues of $12.2 million from the Google Revenue Share Agreement. The Google Revenue Share Agreement has a three-year term and is scheduled to terminate on September 30, 2021. We are in discussions with Google to extend potentially the term of the Google Revenue Share Agreement, but no assurances can be provided as to whether the term will be extended or as to terms of any extension of the agreement. Our results of operations would be adversely affected if the Google Revenue Share Agreement is terminated, either upon its scheduled termination or otherwise, or adversely modified.\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our relationships with advertising agencies and our strategic relationships with third parties.\nOur future growth will depend, in part, on our ability to enter into successful relationships with advertising agencies. Identifying agencies and negotiating and documenting relationships with them requires significant time and resources. These relationships may not result in additional customers or enable us to generate significant revenues. Our contracts for these relationships are typically non-exclusive and do not prohibit the agency from working with our competitors or from offering competing services. Frequently, these agencies do in fact work with our competitors and compete with us. In addition, we often work with, or seek to work with, high-profile brands directly. This may not be possible where, for example, those brands obtain advertising services exclusively or primarily from advertising agencies.\nWe generally bill agencies for their customers\u2019 use of our platform, but in most cases the agency\u2019s customer has no direct contractual commitment to make payment to us. Furthermore, some of these agency contracts include provisions whereby the agency is not liable for making payment to us for our subscription services if the agency does not receive a corresponding payment from its client on whose behalf the subscription services were rendered. These provisions may result in longer collections periods or our inability to collect payment for some of our subscription services. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these agencies on commercially reasonable terms, or if these relationships are not profitable for us, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenues could be impaired and our operating results would suffer.\nOur future growth will also depend, in part, on our ability to enter-into and retain successful strategic relationships with third-parties. For example, we are seeking to establish relationships with third-parties to develop integrations with complementary technology and content. These relationships may not result in additional customers or enable us to generate significant revenues. For example, we entered into the Google Revenue Share Agreement where we receive both fixed and variable revenue share payments based on a percentage of the search advertising spend that is managed through our platform. Identifying partners and negotiating and documenting relationships with them require significant time and resources. Our contracts for these relationships are typically non-exclusive and do not prohibit the other party from working with our competitors or from offering competing services. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenues could be impaired and our operating results would suffer.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nThe overall market for advertising cloud solutions is rapidly evolving, highly competitive, complex, fragmented, and subject to changing technology and shifting customer needs. We face significant competition in this market and we expect competition to intensify in the future. We currently compete with large, well-established companies, such as Adobe Systems Incorporated and Google Inc., and privately held companies, such as Kenshoo Ltd. We also compete with channel-specific offerings, in-house proprietary tools, tools from publishers and custom solutions, including spreadsheets. Increased competition may result in reduced pricing for our solutions, longer sales cycles or a decrease of our market share, any of which could negatively affect our revenues and future operating results and our ability to grow our business.\nA number of competitive factors could cause us to lose potential sales or to sell our solutions at lower prices or at reduced margins, including, among others:\n\u2022\npublishers generally offer their tools for free, or at a reduced price, as their primary compensation is via the sale of advertising on their own or syndicated websites;\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors, such as Adobe, Facebook and Google, have greater financial, marketing and technical resources than we do, allowing them to leverage a larger installed customer base, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services than we can;\n\u2022\nchannel-specific competitors, such as Kenshoo Ltd. and Smartly.io, may devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their channel-specific products and services than we can;\n\u2022\ncompanies may enter our market by expanding their platforms or acquiring a competitor; and\n\u2022\npotential customers may choose to develop or continue to use internal solutions rather than paying for our solutions or may choose to use a competitor\u2019s solution that has different or additional technical capabilities.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. If we cannot compete successfully, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nIn 2020 U.S. federal and state and foreign governments and regulatory agencies initiated lawsuits or investigations against Google and Facebook related to certain of their anticompetitive business practices and conduct in the digital advertising and social media industries and we cannot be certain as to how such lawsuits and investigations might affect Google or Facebook or otherwise affect the digital advertising industry.\nOur business depends on our customers\u2019 continued willingness to manage advertising spend on our platform.\nIn order for us to improve our operating results, it is important that our customers continue to manage their advertising spend on our platform, increase their usage and also purchase additional solutions from us. In the case of our direct advertiser customers, we offer our solutions primarily through subscription contracts and generally bill customers over the related subscription period, which is generally one year or longer. During the term of their contracts, our direct advertiser customers generally have no obligation to maintain or increase their advertising spend on our platform beyond a specified minimum monthly platform fee, which is typically set at the time the contract is signed and is generally greater than half of the monthly amount we anticipate the customer will spend. Our direct advertiser customers generally have no renewal obligation after the initial or then-current renewal subscription period expires, and even if customers renew contracts, they may decrease the level of their digital advertising spend managed through our platform, resulting in lower revenues from that customer. Advertisers that we serve through our arrangements with our advertising agencies generally do not have any contractual commitment to use our platform. Our customers\u2019 usage may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to, their satisfaction with our platform and our customer support, the frequency and severity of outages, the pricing of our, or competing, solutions, the effects of global economic conditions and reductions in spending levels or changes in our customers\u2019 strategies regarding digital advertising. We may not be able to accurately predict future usage trends. If our customers renew on less favorable terms or reduce their advertising spend on our platform, our revenues may grow more slowly than expected or decline.\nUnfavorable conditions in the market for digital advertising or the global economy or reductions in digital advertising spend could negatively affect our operating results.\nPotential revenue growth and profitability of our business depends on digital advertising spend by advertisers in the markets we serve. Our operating results may vary based on changes in the market for digital advertising or the global economy. To the extent that weak economic conditions cause our customers and potential customers to freeze or reduce their advertising budgets, particularly digital advertising, demand for our solution may be negatively affected.\nHistorically, economic downturns have resulted in overall reductions in advertising spend. If economic conditions deteriorate or the rise of geopolitical instability and military hostilities or global health emergencies and pandemics such as COVID-19 causes economic uncertainty, our customers and potential customers may elect to decrease their advertising budgets or defer or reconsider software and service purchases, which would limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results.\nOperational Risks\nOur business depends on retaining and attracting qualified personnel, and turnover may result in operational inefficiencies that could negatively affect our business.\nOur success depends upon the continued service of our talented management, operational and key technical employees, as well as our ability to continue to attract additional highly qualified talent. We have experienced turnover, including, in December 2019, the departure of our former chief financial officer and the promotion of Robert Bertz to chief financial officer. Also, the previous managers of our sales team and our customer service teams left the Company during the quarter ended September 30, 2020. In addition, during the quarter ended September 30, 2020, we commenced a global reduction-in-force and other restructuring actions to reduce our operating expenses and address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. The 2020 Restructuring Plan is expected to ultimately result in the reduction of our global workforce by approximately 60 employees, approximately half of which are located outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2020, the majority of the planned reductions were complete. These changes, and any future changes, in our operations and management team could be disruptive to our operations. Our restructuring actions and any future restructuring actions or employee attrition could have an adverse effect on our business as a result of operational and administrative inefficiencies and added costs, decreases in employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees. If key employees leave, we may not be able to fully integrate new personnel or replicate the prior working relationships, which could adversely affect our results of operations, stock price and customer relationships, and could make recruiting for future management and other positions more difficult. In addition, we must successfully integrate any new senior management and other new personnel within our organization in order to achieve our operating objectives, and changes in other key positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new employees become familiar with our business.\nWe do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. Each of our executive officers, key technical personnel and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. Our business also requires skilled technical, sales and other personnel, who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers. If we expand into additional geographic markets, we will require personnel with expertise in these new areas. Competition for qualified employees is intense in our industry and particularly in San Francisco, California. In addition, we may consider expanding our board of directors to add new experience and expertise to our board and to comply with pending board diversity requirements. Board candidates may be difficult and expensive to recruit and retain and we may incur penalties if we fail to comply with board diversity requirements by applicable deadlines. An inability to retain, attract, relocate and motivate employees and directors required for our business could delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could materially harm our business and our customer relationships.\nWe incur upfront costs associated with onboarding advertisers to our platform and may not recoup our investment if we do not maintain the advertiser relationship over time.\nOur operating results may be negatively affected if we are unable to recoup our upfront costs for onboarding new advertisers to our platform. Upfront costs when adding new advertisers generally include sales commissions for our sales force, expenses associated with entering customer data into our platform and other implementation-related costs. Because our customers, including direct advertisers and agencies, are billed over the term of the contract, if new customers sign contracts with short initial subscription periods and do not renew their subscriptions, or otherwise do not continue to use our platform to a level that generates revenues in excess of our upfront expenses, our operating results could be negatively impacted. In cases in which the implementation process is particularly complex, the revenues resulting from the customer under our contract may not cover the upfront investment; therefore, if a significant number of these customers do not renew their contracts, it could negatively affect our operating results. In addition, because we capitalize certain upfront costs to obtain and fulfill contracts under authoritative accounting guidance, we could be required to record impairment expense for these upfront costs that are not covered by the underlying revenues.\nBecause we generally bill our customers over the term of the contract, near term decline in new or renewed subscriptions may not be reflected immediately in our operating results.\nMost of our revenues in each quarter are derived from contracts entered into with our customers during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be fully reflected in our revenues for that quarter. Such declines, however, would negatively affect our revenues in future periods and the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our solutions, and potential changes in our rate of renewals or renewal terms, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure rapidly, or at all, to take account of reduced revenues. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our total revenues through additional sales in any period, as revenues from new customers must be earned over the applicable subscription term based on the value of their monthly advertising spend.\nWe have been dependent on our customers\u2019 use of search advertising. Any decrease in the use of search advertising or our inability to further penetrate social and eCommerce advertising channels would harm our business, growth prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nHistorically, our customers have primarily used our solutions for managing their search advertising, including mobile search advertising, and the substantial majority of our revenue is derived from advertisers that use our platform to manage their search advertising. We expect that search advertising will continue to be the primary channel used by our customers for the foreseeable future. Should our customers lose confidence in the value or effectiveness of search advertising, or if search advertising growth moderates or declines, the demand for our solutions may decline, and it may negatively impact our revenues. In addition, our failure to achieve market acceptance of our solution for the management of social and eCommerce advertising spend would harm our growth prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nOur sales cycle can be long and unpredictable and require considerable time and expense, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate.\nThe sales cycle for our solutions, from initial contact with a potential lead to contract execution and implementation, varies widely by customer, but can take between three and nine months. Some of our customers undertake a significant evaluation process that frequently involves not only our solutions but also those of our competitors, which has in the past resulted in extended sales cycles. Our sales efforts involve educating our customers about the use, technical capabilities and benefits of our platform. In addition, under certain circumstances, we sometimes offer an initial term, typically of a few months in duration, to new customers who may terminate their subscription at any time during this initial period before the fixed term contract commences. We have no assurance that the substantial time and money spent on our sales efforts will produce any sales. If our sales efforts result in a new customer subscription, the customer may terminate its subscription during the initial period, after we have incurred the expenses associated with entering the customer\u2019s data in our platform and related training and support. If sales expected from a customer are not realized in the time period expected or not realized at all, or if a customer terminates during the initial period, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nHistorically, a significant portion of field sales and professional services were conducted in person. Currently, as a result of the work and travel restrictions related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, substantially all of our sales and professional services activities are being conducted remotely. As of the date of this report, we do not yet know the extent of the negative impact on our ability to attract, serve, retain or upsell customers.\nOur ability to generate revenue depends on our collection of significant amounts of data from various sources.\nOur ability to optimize the delivery of Internet advertisements for our customers depends on our ability to successfully leverage data, including data that we collect from our customers as well as data provided by publishers and from third parties. Using cookies and similar tracking technologies, we collect information about the interaction of users with our advertisers\u2019 and publishers\u2019 websites. Our ability to successfully leverage such data is dependent upon our continued ability to access and utilize such data. Our ability to access and use such data could be restricted by a number of factors, including consumer choice, restrictions imposed by advertisers and publishers, changes in technology, and new developments in laws, regulations, and industry standards.\nIf consumer resistance to the collection and sharing of the data used to deliver targeted advertising, increased visibility of consent / Do Not Track mechanisms as a result of industry regulatory and/or legal developments, and/or the development and deployment of new technologies result in a material impact on our ability to collect data, this will materially impair the results of our operations.\nMaterial defects or errors in our software platform could harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our subscription services.\nThe software applications underlying our subscription services are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors, which may cause disruptions in availability, misallocation of advertising spend or other performance problems. Any such errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our software platform, including those resulting from new versions or updates to our software platform or from changes or interruptions to third party applications or systems that we interconnect with, could negatively impact our customers\u2019 businesses or the success of their advertising campaigns and cause harm to\nour reputation. If we have any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our software platform, customers could elect not to renew or reduce their usage or delay or withhold payment to us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts or an increase in the length of collection cycles for accounts receivable. Errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could also result in customers making warranty or other claims against us, our giving credits to our customers toward future advertising spend or costly litigation. Changes or interruptions to third party applications or systems that we interconnect with could cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such issues or develop integrations with other third-party suppliers. As a result, material defects or errors in our platform could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance.\nThe costs incurred in correcting any material defects or errors in our software platform may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results. After the release of new versions of our software, defects or errors may be identified from time to time by our internal team and by our customers. We implement bug fixes and upgrades as part of our regularly scheduled system maintenance. If we do not complete this maintenance according to schedule or if customers are otherwise dissatisfied with the frequency and/or duration of our maintenance services, customers could elect not to renew, or delay or withhold payment to us, or cause us to issue credits, make refunds or pay penalties.\nWe primarily derive our revenues from a single software platform and any factor adversely affecting subscriptions to our platform could harm our business and operating results.\nWe primarily derive our revenues from sales of a single software platform. As such, any factor adversely affecting subscriptions to our platform, including product release cycles, market acceptance, product competition, performance and reliability, reputation, price competition, and economic and market conditions, could harm our business and operating results.\nIf mobile connected devices, their operating systems or content distribution channels, including those controlled by our competitors, develop in ways that prevent our advertising campaigns from being delivered to their users, our ability to grow our business will be impaired.\nOur success in the mobile channel depends upon the ability of our technology platform to integrate with mobile inventory suppliers and provide advertising for most mobile connected devices, as well as the major operating systems that run on them and the applications that are downloaded onto them. For example, the release of iOS 14 brought with it a number of new changes, including the need for app users to opt-in before their identifier for advertisers, or IDFA, can be accessed by an app (which is currently expected to come into effect in 2021). Apple\u2019s IDFA is a string of numbers and letters assigned to Apple devices which advertisers use to identify app users to deliver personalized and targeted advertising. Although Marin doesn't rely heavily on IDFA, low opt-in rates to grant IDFA access may result in advertisers rethinking their conversion tracking strategy. Any reduced ability of advertisers to accurately target and measure their advertising campaigns may cause spend fluctuations.\nFurther, the design of mobile devices and operating systems is controlled by third parties with whom we do not have any formal relationships. These parties frequently introduce new devices, and from time to time they may introduce new operating systems or modify existing ones. Network carriers may also impact the ability to access specified content on mobile devices. If our solution were unable to work on these devices or operating systems, either because of technological constraints or because an operating system or app developer, device maker or carrier wished to impair our ability to purchase inventory and provide advertisements, our ability to generate revenue could be significantly harmed.\nIf our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to customer data or our data is otherwise obtained, our solutions may be perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our solutions and we may incur significant liabilities.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our networks, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation. We believe that companies have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. These threats can come from a variety of sources, ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to a state-sponsored attack. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems. Cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against. Our network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. These data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could result in the loss of information, litigation, indemnity obligations and other liability. While we have security measures in place, our systems and networks are subject to ongoing threats and therefore these security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including cyber-attacks or other intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. This could result in one or more third parties obtaining unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 data or our data, including intellectual property and other confidential business information. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Third parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers\u2019 data or our data, including intellectual property and other confidential business information. If an actual or perceived\nbreach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose potential sales and existing customers or we could incur other liabilities, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe primarily use third-party data centers to deliver our services. Any disruption of service at these facilities could harm our business.\nWe manage a significant portion of our services and serve substantially all of our customers from only a single third-party data center facility. While we control the actual computer, network and storage systems upon which our platform runs, and deploy them to the data center facility, we do not control the operation of the facility. The owner of the facility has no obligation to renew the agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew the agreement on commercially reasonable terms, we may be required to transfer to a new facility or facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so.\nThe facility is vulnerable to damage or service interruption resulting from human error, intentional bad acts, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, war, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, telecommunications failures and similar events. Moreover, while we have a disaster recovery plan in place, we do not maintain a \u201chot failover\u201d instance of our software platform permitting us to immediately switch over in the event of damage or service interruption at our data center. The occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, any outages or vandalism or other misconduct, or a decision to close the facility without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.\nAny changes in service levels at the facility or any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems at or related to the facility that affect our services could harm our reputation and may damage our customers\u2019 businesses. Interruptions in our services might reduce our revenues, subject us to potential liability, or result in reduced usage of our platform. In addition, some of our customer contracts require us to issue credits for downtime in excess of certain levels and in some instances give our customers the ability to terminate their subscriptions.\nWe also depend on third-party Internet-hosting providers and continuous and uninterrupted access to the Internet through third-party bandwidth providers to operate our business. If we lose the services of one or more of our Internet-hosting or bandwidth providers for any reason or if their services are disrupted, for example due to viruses or \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d or other attacks on their systems, or due to human error, intentional bad acts, power loss, hardware failures, telecommunications failures, fires, wars, terrorist attacks, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes or similar events, we could experience disruption in our ability to offer our solutions or we could be required to retain the services of replacement providers, which could increase our operating costs and harm our business and reputation.\nDepending upon the level of our customers\u2019 usage of our software platform, we may need to continually improve our hosting infrastructure to avoid service interruptions or slower system performance.\nWe seek to maintain sufficient excess capacity in our infrastructure to meet the needs of all of our customers. We also seek to maintain excess capacity to facilitate the rapid provision of new customer deployments and the expansion of existing customer deployments. For example, if we secure a large customer or a group of customers that require significant amounts of bandwidth or storage, we may need to increase bandwidth, storage, power or other elements of our application architecture and our infrastructure, and our existing systems may not be able to scale in a manner satisfactory to our existing or prospective customers.\nThe amount of infrastructure needed to support our customers is based on our estimates of anticipated usage. If we were to experience unforeseen increases in usage, we could be required to increase our infrastructure investments resulting in increased costs or reduced gross margins, and if we do not accurately predict our infrastructure capacity requirements, our customers could experience service outages that may subject us to financial penalties and liabilities and result in customer losses. If our hosting infrastructure capacity fails to keep pace with sales, customers may experience service interruptions or slower system performance, which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenue growth. As customers use our software platform for more complicated tasks, we will need to devote resources to improve our application architecture and our infrastructure in order to maintain the performance of our software platform. We may need to incur additional costs to upgrade or expand our computer systems and architecture if our systems cannot handle current or higher volumes of usage. In addition, increasing our systems and infrastructure in advance of new customers would cause us to have increased cost of revenues, which can adversely affect our gross margins until we increase revenues that are spread over the increased costs.\nOur solutions must integrate with our customers\u2019 enterprise applications and infrastructures. If we cannot efficiently implement our solutions for customers, we may lose customers.\nOur customers have a variety of different data formats, enterprise applications and infrastructure and our platform must support our customers\u2019 data formats and integrate with complex enterprise applications and infrastructures. If our platform does not currently support a customer\u2019s required data format or appropriately integrate with a customer\u2019s applications and infrastructure, then we may choose to configure our platform to do so, which would increase our expenses. Additionally, we do not control our customers\u2019 implementation schedules. As a result, as we have experienced in the past, if our customers do not allocate internal resources necessary to meet their implementation responsibilities or if we face unanticipated implementation difficulties, the implementation may be delayed. Further, in the past, our implementation capacity has at times constrained our ability to successfully implement our solutions for our customers in a timely manner, particularly during periods of high demand. If the customer implementation process is not executed successfully or if execution is delayed, we could incur significant costs, customers could become dissatisfied and decide not to increase usage of our platform, not to use our platform beyond an initial period prior to their term commitment and revenue recognition could be delayed. In addition, competitors with more efficient operating models with lower implementation costs could penetrate our customer relationships.\nAdditionally, large customers may request or require specific features or functions unique to their particular business processes, which increase our upfront investment in sales and deployment efforts and the revenues resulting from the customers under our typical contract length may not cover the upfront investments. If prospective large customers require specific features or functions that we do not offer, then the market for our solution will be more limited and our business could suffer. In addition, supporting large customers could require us to devote significant development services and support personnel and strain our personnel resources and infrastructure. If we are unable to address the needs of these customers in a timely fashion or further develop and enhance our solution, these customers may not renew their subscriptions, seek to terminate their relationship with us, renew on less favorable terms, or reduce their advertising spend on our platform. If any of these were to occur, our revenues may decline and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to maintain or expand our sales and marketing capabilities, we may not be able to generate anticipated revenues.\nIncreasing our customer base and achieving broader market acceptance of our software platform will depend to an extent on our ability to maintain or expand our sales and marketing operations and activities. We are substantially dependent on our sales force to obtain new customers and our marketing organization to generate a sufficient pipeline of qualified sales leads. We may need to restructure or expand our sales team in order to maintain or increase revenues from new and existing customers and to further penetrate our existing markets. Our solutions require a sophisticated sales force with specific sales skills and technical knowledge. Competition for qualified sales personnel is intense, and we may not be able to retain our existing sales personnel or attract, integrate, train or retain sufficient highly qualified sales personnel. In 2020, we commenced the 2020 Restructuring Plan to reduce our operating expenses and address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, which resulted in changes to the leadership, structure and composition of our sales and marketing teams. These changes, and any future changes, in our sales and marketing teams could be disruptive to our operations. In addition, we may need to invest in lead generation activities to develop our pipeline of qualified opportunities for our sales force, which could increase our marketing expenses. If our lead generation activities do not increase our pipeline or if our sales force is unable to close opportunities at a high rate, then we may not generate an increase in revenues.\nAny failure to offer high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and harm our financial results.\nOur customers depend on our support organization to resolve any technical issues relating to our solutions. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of our employees worldwide are currently working remotely, including our customer support organization. We implemented the 2020 Restructuring Plan to reduce our operating expenses and address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, which resulted in changes to the leadership, structure and composition of our customer support teams. These changes, and any future changes, in our customer support teams could be disruptive to our operations. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on the quality of our solutions, our business reputation and on strong recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to sell our solutions to existing and prospective customers, and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe offer technical support services with our solutions and may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. We also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors. It is difficult to predict customer demand for technical support services and if customer demand increases significantly, we may be unable to provide satisfactory support services to our customers. Additionally, increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results.\nAny failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.\nOur success and ability to compete depends in part upon our intellectual property. We primarily rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions with our employees, customers, partners and others to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate or we may be unable to secure intellectual property protection for all of our solutions. In particular, we have three issued U.S. patents.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors could use our intellectual property to market products and services similar to ours and our ability to compete effectively would be impaired. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights depends on our legal actions against these infringers being successful, but we cannot be sure these actions will be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense and diversion of management resources. Any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative processes or litigation. Any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties.\nFurthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Effective protection of our intellectual property may not be available to us in every country in which our solutions are available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nWe might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, and could ultimately result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property.\nWe could incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement of another party\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights. Companies in the Internet and technology industries are increasingly bringing and becoming subject to suits alleging infringement of proprietary rights, particularly patent rights, and our competitors may hold patents or have pending patent applications, which could be related to our business. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties, which we refer to as non-practicing entities, whose sole primary business is to assert such claims. We have received in the past, and expect to receive in the future, notices that claim we or our customers using our solutions have misappropriated or misused other parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. If we are sued by a third party that claims that our technology infringes its rights, the litigation could be expensive and could divert our management resources. We do not currently have an extensive patent portfolio of our own, which may limit the defenses available to us in any such litigation.\nIn addition, in most instances, we have agreed to indemnify our customers against certain claims that our subscription services infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. Our business could be adversely affected by any significant disputes between us and our customers as to the applicability or scope of our indemnification obligations to them. The results of any intellectual property litigation to which we might become a party, or for which we are required to provide indemnification, may require us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\ncease offering or using technologies that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\nmake substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments or other costs or damages;\n\u2022\nobtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms, to sell or use the relevant technology; or\n\u2022\nredesign technology to avoid infringement.\nIf we are required to make substantial payments or undertake any of the other actions noted above as a result of any intellectual property infringement claims against us or any obligation to indemnify our customers for such claims, such payments or costs could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial results.\nOur use of open source technology could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our software platform.\nWe use open source software in our platform. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any\nderivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by the U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our software platform. While we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose our source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement, such use could inadvertently occur and we may be required to release our proprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, re-engineer our applications, discontinue sales in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could cause us to breach customer contracts, harm our reputation, result in customer losses or claims, increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business and operating results.\nBecause our long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand our sales to customers outside the United States, our business will be susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nWe currently have personnel and/or customers in China, England, France, Ireland, Japan and Singapore, as well as the United States. Due to our international exposure, our business is susceptible to risks associated with international operations. However, we have a limited operating history outside the United States, and our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of diverse cultures, languages, customs, tax laws, legal systems, alternate dispute systems and regulatory systems. In 2020, we commenced a restructuring of our international corporate structure to address pending changes in international tax laws and regulations, and completion of such restructuring may cause us to incur some additional expense. The risks and challenges associated with international expansion include:\n\u2022\nthe need to support and integrate with local publishers and partners;\n\u2022\ncontinued localization of our platform, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u2022\ncompetition with companies that have greater experience in the local markets than we do or who have pre-existing relationships with potential customers in those markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with multiple, potentially conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations and legal and operational changes resulting from the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union;\n\u2022\ncompliance with anti-bribery laws, including compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in invoicing and collecting in foreign currencies and associated foreign currency exposure;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with international operations;\n\u2022\ndifferent or lesser protection of our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, longer payment cycles and other collection difficulties;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\nexposure to more affected areas of the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022\nregional economic and political conditions.\nWe have limited experience in marketing, selling and supporting our subscription services internationally, which increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake will not be successful.\nFluctuations in the exchange rate of foreign currencies could result in currency transactions losses.\nWe currently have foreign sales denominated in Australian Dollars, British Pound Sterling, Chinese Yuan, Euros, Japanese Yen and Singaporean Dollars. In addition, we incur a portion of our operating expenses in the currencies of the countries where we have offices. We face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates, which may cause our revenues and operating results to differ materially from expectations. In addition, the continued uncertainty around the full impact of Brexit and the exact trade arrangements upon exit has adversely impacted global markets, including currencies, and resulted in a decline and volatility in the value of the British Pound Sterling and the Euro, as compared to the U.S. Dollar and other currencies. Volatility in exchange rates and global financial markets is expected to continue due to a number of factors, including uncertainty surrounding Brexit trade arrangements and the recent political and economic uncertainty globally. If the U.S. Dollar strengthens relative to foreign currencies as it has been since the second quarter of 2018, our non-U.S. revenues would be adversely affected. Conversely, a decline in the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies would increase our non-U.S. revenues when translated into U.S. Dollars. Our operating results could be negatively impacted depending on the amount of expense denominated in foreign currencies. As exchange rates vary, revenues, cost of revenues, operating expenses and other operating results, when translated, may differ materially from expectations. In addition, our revenues and operating results are subject to fluctuation if our mix of U.S. and foreign currency-denominated transactions or expenses changes in the future because we do not currently hedge our foreign currency exposure. Even if we were to implement hedging strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk, these strategies might not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and would involve costs and risks of their own, such as ongoing management time and expertise, external costs to implement the strategies and potential accounting implications.\nManaging a global organization has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management and infrastructure. If we fail to manage our operations effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service or address competitive challenges adequately.\nManaging a global and geographically dispersed workforce and operation has required substantial management effort, the allocation of valuable management resources and significant additional investment in our infrastructure. We will be required to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and operations reporting procedures, and we may not be able to do so effectively. Moreover, we may from time to time decide to undertake cost savings initiatives, such as the 2020 Restructuring Plan which we began implementing in July 2020, disposing of, and/or otherwise discontinuing certain products, in an effort to focus our resources on key strategic initiatives and streamline our business. Further, supporting our customers and operations, and driving future growth, we must continually improve and maintain our technology, systems and network infrastructure. As such, we may be unable to manage our expenses effectively in the future, which may negatively impact our gross margins or operating expenses in any particular quarter. If we fail to manage our anticipated growth or change in a manner that does not preserve the key aspects of our corporate culture, the quality of our solutions may suffer, which could negatively affect our brand and reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract customers.\nFuture acquisitions or divestitures, strategic investments, partnerships or alliances could be difficult to integrate or complete, divert the attention of key management personnel, disrupt our business, dilute shareholder value and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe acquired and divested businesses in the past and may seek to acquire or divest businesses, products or technologies in the future. However, we have limited experience in acquiring and integrating businesses, products and technologies. If we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may not be successful in negotiating the terms and/or financing of the acquisition, and our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, product or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, product quality or architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or client issues.\nAny acquisition or investment may require us to use significant amounts of cash, issue potentially dilutive equity securities or incur debt. In addition, acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including:\n\u2022\nregulatory and commercial risks relating to advertising technologies we may acquire;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, services and personnel of acquired businesses, especially if those businesses operate outside of our core competency or in foreign countries;\n\u2022\ncultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n\u2022\nreputation and perception risks associated with the acquired product or technology by the general public;\n\u2022\nineffectiveness or incompatibility of acquired technologies or services;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ninability to maintain the key business relationships and the reputations of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nlitigation for activities of the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, clients, former shareholders or other third parties;\n\u2022\nfailure to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company, technology, or solution, including issues related to intellectual property, solution quality or architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or client issues;\n\u2022\nin the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; costs necessary to establish and maintain effective internal controls for acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully further develop the acquired technology in order to recoup our investment; and\n\u2022\nincreased fixed costs.\nIf we are unable to successfully integrate any future business, product or technology we acquire, our business and results of operations may suffer.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. If our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAcquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. For instance, in connection with our prior acquisitions, we issued shares of our common stock. We may consider divestitures of certain non-core businesses, products, technologies or other assets from time to time. We may not be successful in identifying buyers for any such assets or in negotiating the terms of any such sale. Any such sale could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn November 2019, we completed the divestiture of assets and liabilities related to our Perfect Audience business to SharpSpring, Inc., an unrelated third party, for net proceeds of $4.3 million.\nRegulatory and Compliance Risks\nDomestic and foreign government regulation and enforcement of data practices and data tracking technologies is expansive, not clearly defined and rapidly evolving. Such regulation could directly restrict portions of our business or indirectly affect our business by constraining our customers\u2019 use of our platform or limiting the growth of our markets.\nFederal, state, municipal and/or foreign governments and agencies have adopted and could in the future adopt, modify, apply or enforce laws, policies, and regulations covering user privacy, data security, technologies such as cookies that are used to collect, store and/or process data, the taxation of products and services, unfair and deceptive practices, and/or the collection, use, processing, transfer, storage and/or disclosure of data associated with a unique individual. The categories of data regulated under these laws vary widely and are often ill-defined and subject to new applications or interpretation by regulators. Our subscription services enable our customers to display digital advertisements to targeted population segments, as well as collect, manage and store data regarding the measurement and valuation of their digital advertising and marketing campaigns, which may include data that is directly or indirectly obtained or derived through the activities of online or mobile visitors. The uncertainty and inconsistency among these laws, coupled with a lack of guidance as to how these laws will be applied to current and emerging Internet and mobile analytics technologies, creates a risk that regulators, lawmakers or other third parties, such as potential plaintiffs, may assert claims, pursue investigations or audits, or engage in civil or criminal enforcement. These actions could limit the market for our subscription services or impose burdensome requirements on our services and/or customers\u2019 use of our services, thereby rendering our business unprofitable.\nThe General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, is applicable in all European Union member states and prescribes data protection requirements in the European Union and substantial fines for non-compliance. We make use of model contractual clauses approved by the European Commission in relation to the transfer of personal data from the European Union to the United States. The European Commission\u2019s model contractual clauses are subject to changes and legal challenges in the European Union, however, and it is unclear whether these will continue serve as appropriate means for us to transfer personal data from the European Union to the United States. Some features of our subscription services use cookies, which trigger the data protection requirements of certain foreign jurisdictions, such as the GDPR and the EU ePrivacy Directive. In addition, our services collect data about visitors\u2019 interactions with our advertiser clients that may be subject to regulation under current or future laws or regulations. If our privacy or data security measures fail to comply with these current or future laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we collect information, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, civil or criminal enforcement, audits or other liabilities in such jurisdictions, or our advertisers may terminate their relationships with us. In addition, foreign court judgments or regulatory actions could impact our ability to transfer, process and/or receive transnational data that is critical to our operations, including data relating to users,\nclients, or partners outside the United States. Such judgments or actions could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results if foreign clients and partners are not able to lawfully transfer data to us.\nThis area of the law is currently under intense government scrutiny and many governments, including the U.S. government, are considering a variety of proposed regulations that would restrict or impact the conditions under which data obtained from or through the activities of visitors could be collected, processed or stored. In addition, regulators such as the Federal Trade Commission and the California Attorney General are continually proposing new regulations and interpreting and applying existing regulations in new ways. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, took effect January 1, 2020, which provides new data privacy rights for consumers and new disclosure and operational requirements for companies. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. In connection with the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, new or amended data privacy laws may be adopted in the United Kingdom. The burdens imposed by the GDPR and CCPA, and changes to existing laws or new laws regulating the solicitation, collection or processing of personal and consumer information, truth-in-advertising and consumer protection could affect our customers\u2019 utilization of digital advertising and marketing, potentially reducing demand for our subscription services, or impose restrictions that make it more difficult or expensive for us to provide our services.\nIf legislation dampens the growth in web and mobile usage or access to the Internet, our results of operations could be harmed.\nLegislation enacted in the future could dampen the growth in web and mobile usage and decrease its acceptance as a medium of communications and commerce or result in increased adoption of new modes of communication and commerce that may not be serviced by our products. In addition, government agencies or private organizations may begin to impose taxes, fees or other charges for accessing the Internet, which could result in slower growth or a decrease in eCommerce, use of social media and/or use of mobile devices. Any of these outcomes could cause demand for our platform to decrease, our costs to increase, and our results of operations and financial condition to be harmed.\nIf our customers fail to abide by applicable privacy laws or to provide adequate notice and/or obtain consent from end users, we could be subject to litigation or enforcement action or reduced demand for our services. Industry self-regulatory standards may be implemented in the future that could affect demand for our platform and our ability to access data we use to provide our platform.\nOur customers utilize our services to support and measure their direct interactions with visitors, and although we provide notice and choice mechanisms on our websites for our subscription services, we also must rely on our customers to implement and administer notice and choice mechanisms required under applicable laws. If we or our customers fail to abide by these laws, it could result in litigation or regulatory or enforcement action against our customers or against us directly.\nIn addition, self-regulatory organizations (such as the Digital Advertising Network or Network Advertising Initiative) to which our customers, partners and suppliers may belong, may impose opt-in or opt-out requirements on our customers, which may in the future require our customers to provide various mechanisms for users to opt-in or opt-out of the collection of any data, including anonymous data, with respect to such users\u2019 web or mobile activities. The online and/or mobile industries may adopt technical or industry standards, or federal, state, local or foreign laws may be enacted that allow users to opt-in or opt-out of data that is necessary to our business. In particular, some government regulators and standard-setting organizations have suggested a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d standard that allows users to express a preference, independent of cookie settings in their browser, not to have website browsing recorded. All the major Internet browsers have implemented some version of a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d setting. Furthermore, publishers may implement alternative tracking technologies that make it more difficult to access the data necessary to our business or make it more difficult for us to compete with the publisher\u2019s own advertising management solutions. If any of these events were to occur in the future, it could have a material effect on our ability to provide services and for our customers to collect the data that is necessary to use our services.\nOur revenues may be adversely affected if we are required to charge sales taxes in additional jurisdictions or other taxes for our solutions.\nWe collect or have imposed upon us sales or other taxes related to the solutions we sell in certain states and other jurisdictions. An increasing number of states have considered or adopted laws that attempt to impose tax collection obligations on out-of-state companies. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. et al, or Wayfair, that online sellers can be required to collect sales and use tax despite not having a physical presence in the buyer\u2019s state. In response to Wayfair, or otherwise, states or local governments may adopt, or begin to enforce, laws requiring us to calculate, collect, and remit taxes on sales in their jurisdictions. A successful assertion by any state, country or other jurisdiction in which we do business that we should be collecting sales or other taxes on the sale of our products and services could, among other things, create significant administrative burdens for us, result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, discourage clients from purchasing solutions from us or otherwise substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nIf we experience material weaknesses or deficiencies in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nIn the past, we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. While we have remediated such material weakness, there can be no assurance that we will not identify additional control deficiencies or material weaknesses in the future. If we identify material weaknesses or deficiencies in the future, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, in a timely manner, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and as a result we can provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in our filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404 requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and we have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as a smaller reporting company may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on the exemptions available to smaller reporting companies. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss or research tax credit carryforwards, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses, which if not utilized will begin to expire in 2027 and 2022 for federal and state purposes, respectively. Our federal net operating loss generated in 2018 and after can be carried forward indefinitely. We also have federal research tax credit carryforwards, which if not utilized will begin to expire in 2026. These net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, such as research tax credits, in any taxable year may be limited if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d A Section 382 \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws.\nFuture issuances of our stock could cause an \u201cownership change.\u201d It is possible that any future ownership change could have a material effect on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our amortizable long-lived assets become impaired.\nWe are required under GAAP to review our amortizable long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The events and circumstances we consider include the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators and competition. In the future we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which any impairment of our long-lived assets is determined. This could adversely impact our results of operations and harm our business.\nWe previously recorded a goodwill balance as a result of acquisitions in prior years. In November 2019, we performed an impairment assessment of goodwill in conjunction with the divestiture of the assets and liabilities of our Perfect Audience business to SharpSpring, Inc., an unrelated third party. We performed this assessment utilizing the simplified method, and it resulted in an impairment of goodwill of $1.9 million at that time, reducing the goodwill balance to zero.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nIf we cannot meet the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Global Market, The Nasdaq Global Market may de-list our common stock, which would have an adverse effect on the trading volume, liquidity and market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Market, or Nasdaq. Although we currently meet Nasdaq\u2019s listing standards, which generally require that we meet certain requirements relating to stockholders\u2019 equity, market capitalization, stock price, the aggregate market value of publicly held shares, and distribution requirements, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to meet Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements. One of Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements is that our shares maintain a minimum bid price of at least $1.00. If a company\u2019s shares trade for 30 consecutive business days below the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq will send a deficiency notice to the company, advising that it has been afforded a \u201ccompliance period\u201d of 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the applicable requirements. As of February 19, 2021, the closing price of our common stock on Nasdaq was $2.63. The closing price of common stock on Nasdaq was below $1.00 for a total of four days in 2020, but not for more than a maximum of three consecutive trading days in 2020. If we fail to satisfy Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements, Nasdaq may take steps to de-list our common stock. If Nasdaq delists our securities for trading on the Nasdaq, we could face significant adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022\na limited availability of market quotations for our common stock;\n\u2022\nreduced liquidity with respect to our common stock;\n\u2022\nreduced trading volume in and market price of our common stock;\n\u2022\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n\u2022\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nSuch a de-listing would likely have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a de-listing, we may take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity or trading volume of our common stock, prevent our common capitalization and stockholder\u2019s equity from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum requirements, or prevent other future non-compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations and could subject us to litigation.\nSince our initial public offering, the closing sales price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (from March 22, 2013 through June 19, 2018) and The Nasdaq Global Market (from June 20, 2018 to December 31, 2020) has been volatile. From January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020, the closing sales price of our common stock on The Nasdaq Global Market ranged from $0.87 to $7.18 per share. From January 1, 2021 through February 19, 2021, the closing sales price of our common stock on The Nasdaq Global Market ranged from $1.99 to $3.06 per share. Factors affecting the market price of our common stock include:\n\u2022\nvariations in, or forward-looking guidance regarding, our revenues, gross margin, operating results, free cash flow, loss per share, revenue retention rates, annualized advertising spend on our platform, adjusted EBITDA and how these results compare to analyst and investor expectations;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new products or services, strategic alliances, acquisitions or significant agreements or other developments by us or related to our competitors, including any announcements of regulatory actions, lawsuits or other developments, such as the recently announced U.S. and state government lawsuits against Google and Facebook;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in our cloud-based operations or services or disruptions of other prominent cloud-based operations or services;\n\u2022\ndisruptions to financial markets and market conditions as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nthe economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry, and the industries of our customers;\n\u2022\nthe timing, volume and pricing of any sales of shares by us under our at-the-market offering program or otherwise; and\n\u2022\nany other factors discussed herein.\nBecause our stock price has been volatile, investing in our common stock is risky.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced substantial price and volume volatility that is often seemingly unrelated to the operating results of any particular companies. In particular, the stock market has recently experienced heightened volatility in connection with the global pandemic of COVID-19. Moreover, if the market for technology stocks, especially software and cloud computing-related stocks, or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The market price for our stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry, even if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been subject of securities litigation. If we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nIf we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible into our common stock in the future, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be diluted.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock. Any sales of securities by existing stockholders or by us could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOn March 14, 2019, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 for the potential offering, issuance and sale by us of up to $50.0 million of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants to purchase our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subscription rights to purchase our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, and units consisting of all or some of these securities. Our shelf registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on May 10, 2019. Pursuant to an equity distribution agreement between us and JMP Securities, common stock with an aggregate offering price of up to $13.0 million could be issued and sold pursuant to an \u201cat-the-market\u201d offering for sales of our common stock. As of December 31, 2020, 3.4 million shares of our common stock have been sold pursuant to the equity distribution agreement since it was established, for net proceeds of approximately $9.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 2.7 million shares of our common stock under the equity distribution agreement for net proceeds of approximately $7.5 million. The 2.7 million shares of our common stock that we issued under the equity distribution agreement during 2020 increased the number of outstanding shares of our common stock by approximately 40%. During February 2021 we sold an additional 1.2 million shares of our common stock under the equity distribution agreement and received proceeds of $3.1 million, net of offering costs of $0.1 million, at a weighted average sales price of $2.68 per share. There are currently no additional amounts available to be sold under this equity distribution agreement, but we intend to explore other options to raise additional financing.\nBecause management has broad discretion as to the use of the net proceeds from our recent or any potential future sales of securities, you may not agree with how we use them, and such proceeds may not be applied successfully.\nOur management will have broad discretion over the use of proceeds from our recent or any potential future sales of our securities. We currently intend to use the net proceeds from our \u201cat-the-market\u201d offering to fund research and development of our technology and for working capital and general corporate purposes. However, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from such offering and any future offerings and could spend the proceeds in ways that do not necessarily improve our operating results or enhance the value of our common stock, or that you otherwise do not agree with. The failure of our management to apply these funds effectively could, among other things, result in unfavorable returns and uncertainty about our prospects, each of which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nDelaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, and limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our Company more difficult, including the following:\n\u2022\nour Board is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors can only be removed from office for cause;\n\u2022\nonly our Board has the right to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our Board or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board;\n\u2022\nonly our chairman of the Board, our lead independent director, our chief executive officer, our president, or a majority of our Board is authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;\n\u2022\nour restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established, and shares of which may be issued, without the approval of the holders of common stock; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\nIn addition, our restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for: (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (2) any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; (3) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our restated bylaws; (4) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our restated certificate of incorporation or our restated bylaws, or (5) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nGeneral Risk Factor\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.", "PERMNO": 13812, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "MRIN"}
