You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with all of the other information included herewith, before you decide whether to invest in shares of our Common Stock. The risks identified below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In that case, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results, and may result in the loss of part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Technologies\nThe market for media measurement and analytics products is highly competitive, and if we cannot compete effectively, our revenues could decline and our business could be harmed.\nThe market for audience and advertising measurement products is highly competitive and is evolving rapidly. We compete primarily with providers of media intelligence and related analytical products and services. We also compete with providers of marketing services and solutions, with full-service survey providers, and with internal solutions developed by customers and potential customers.\nSome of our competitors have longer operating histories, access to larger customer bases and substantially greater resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, panel retention, panel development, or development of systems and technologies than we can. In addition, some of our competitors have adopted and may continue to adopt aggressive pricing policies, including the provision of certain services at little or no cost, in order to retain or acquire customers.\nFurthermore, large software companies, internet portals and database management companies may enter our market or enhance their current offerings, either by developing competing services or by acquiring our competitors, and could leverage their significant resources and pre-existing relationships with our current and potential customers. Finally, consolidation of our competitors could make it difficult for us to compete effectively.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, we may not be able to retain and acquire customers, and we may consequently experience a decline in revenues, reduced operating margins, loss of market share and diminished value from our products.\nThe market for cross-platform products is developing, and if it does not develop further, or develops more slowly than expected, our business could be harmed.\nThe market for cross-platform products is still developing, and it is uncertain whether these products will achieve or maintain high levels of demand and increased market acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of companies to increase their use of such products and to continue use of such products on a long-term basis. Factors that may affect market acceptance include:\n\u2022\nthe reliability of cross-platform products;\n\u2022\ndecisions of our customers and potential customers to develop cross-platform solutions internally rather than purchasing such products from third-party suppliers like us;\n\u2022\ndecisions by industry associations in the U.S. or in other countries that result in association-directed awards of measurement contracts to one or a limited number of competitive vendors;\n\u2022\nthe rate of growth in e-commerce and mobile commerce, cross-platform focused advertising and continued growth in television and digital media consumption; and\n\u2022\npublic and regulatory concern regarding privacy and data security.\nThe adoption of advertising across television and digital platforms, particularly by advertisers that have historically relied on traditional offline media, requires the acceptance of new approaches to conducting business and a willingness to invest in such new approaches. Moreover, the decision to adopt a cross-platform approach to buying advertisement campaigns requires a change to buying approaches and a willingness to adopt new data analytics to assist in evaluating such approaches by advertisement buyers who traditionally focus on buying advertising campaigns through one medium. Advertisers may perceive such new approaches to advertising or understanding advertising to be less effective than traditional methods for marketing their products. They may also be unwilling to pay premium rates for advertising that is targeted at specific segments of validated users based on their demographic profile or internet behavior across digital media platforms. The digital media advertising and e-commerce markets may also be adversely affected by privacy issues relating to such targeted advertising, including that which makes use of personalized information or online behavioral information. Because of the foregoing factors, among others, the market for cross-platform focused\ndigital media advertising and e-commerce may not continue to grow at significant rates. If these markets do not continue to develop, or if they develop more slowly than expected, our business could suffer.\nIf we are unable to provide television, digital or cross-platform analytics, or if our analytics are incomplete, our ability to maintain and grow our business may be harmed.\nAs the media and advertising industries increasingly evaluate advertising campaigns across various forms of media, such as television, online, and mobile, the ability to measure the combined size and composition of audiences across platforms is increasingly important and in demand.\nIf we are unable to gain or maintain access to information measuring a media component or type, or if we are unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to meet our customers' demands and our business and financial performance may be harmed. Furthermore, even if we do have access to television and digital (including mobile and OTT) data, if we have insufficient technology, encounter challenges in our methodological approaches or inadequate source materials to parse the information across such media components to avoid duplications or to do so in a cost-effective manner, our products may be inferior to other offerings, and we may be unable to meet our customers' demands. In such event, our business and financial performance may be harmed.\nIn particular, our acquisition of television data may be reliant on companies that have historically held a dominant market position measuring television to produce industry-accepted measurement across a combination of media platforms. Our competitors, such as Nielsen (with whom we have agreements, scheduled to expire in 2020 and 2021, to license certain geographic market definitions (DMA) used in our products and Arbitron data used in our cross-platform solutions), or other providers may have more leverage with data providers and may be unable or unwilling to provide us with access to quality data to support our products, on reasonable terms or at all. Likewise, our acquisition of digital data may be reliant on large digital publishers that may technologically or legally prevent access to their proprietary platforms for research or measurement purposes. Moreover, as mobile devices, technology and OTT viewing continue to proliferate, gaining and maintaining cost-effective access to mobile and OTT data will become increasingly critical, and we could face difficulty in accessing these forms of data. If we are unable to acquire data effectively and efficiently, or if the cost of data acquisition increases, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe depend on third parties for data that is critical to our business, and our business could suffer if we cannot continue to obtain reliable data from these suppliers or if third parties place additional restrictions on our use of such data.\nWe rely on third-party data sources for information usage across the media platforms that we measure, as well as demographics about the people that use such platforms. The availability and accuracy of this data is important to the continuation and development of our products and the performance of our obligations to customers. These data suppliers, some of whom compete with us, may increase restrictions on our use of such data, undertake audits (at either our or their expense) of our use of such data, require us to implement new processes with respect to such data, fail to adhere to our quality control, privacy or security standards or otherwise satisfactorily perform services, increase the price they charge us for the data or refuse to license the data to us. Additional restrictions on third-party data could limit our ability to include that data in certain products, which could lead to decreased commercial opportunities for certain products as well as loss of customers, sales credits, refunds or liability to our customers. To comply with any additional restrictions, we may be required to implement certain additional technological and manual controls that could put pressure on our cost structure and could affect our pricing. Supplier consolidation and increased pricing for additional use cases could also put pressure on our cost structure and our ability to meet obligations to our customers. We may be required to enter into vendor relationships, strategic alliances, or joint ventures with some third parties in order to obtain access to the data sources that we need. If our partners do not apply rigorous standards to their data collection methodology and actions, notwithstanding our best efforts, we may receive third-party data that is inaccurate, defective, or delayed. If third-party information is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or is found to be inaccurate, it could harm our products, our reputation, and our business and financial performance.\nIf we fail to respond to technological developments or evolving industry standards, our products may become obsolete or less competitive.\nOur future success will depend in part on our ability to develop new and modify or enhance our existing products and services, including without limitation, our data collection technologies and approaches, in order to meet customer needs, add functionality and address technological advancements and industry standards. For example, if certain proprietary hand-held mobile devices become the primary mode of receiving content and conducting transactions on the internet, and we are unable to adapt to collect information from such devices, then we would not be able to report on digital usage activity. To remain competitive, we will need to develop new products that address these evolving technologies and standards across the universe of media including television, online, and mobile usage. However, we may be unsuccessful in identifying new product opportunities, developing or marketing new products in a timely or cost-effective manner, or obtaining the necessary access to data or technologies needed to support new products, or we may be limited in our ability to operate due to patents held by others. In addition, our product innovations may not achieve the market penetration or price levels necessary for profitability. If we are unable to develop timely enhancements to,\nand new features for, our existing methodologies or products or if we are unable to develop new products and technology that keep pace with rapid technological developments or changing industry standards, our products may become obsolete, less marketable and less competitive, and our business will be harmed.\nFurthermore, the market for our products is characterized by changes in protocols and evolving industry standards. For example, industry associations such as the Advertising Research Foundation, the Council of American Survey Research Organizations, the Internet Advertising Bureau (\"IAB\"), and the Media Rating Council (\"MRC\") as well as internationally-based industry associations have independently initiated efforts to either review market research methodologies across the media that we measure or develop minimum standards for such research. Failure to achieve accreditation, delays in accreditation, or adverse audit findings may negatively impact the market acceptance of our products. Meanwhile, successful accreditation or audits may lead to costly changes to our procedures and methodologies.\nOur business may be harmed if we deliver, or are perceived to deliver, inaccurate information products.\nThe metrics contained in our products may be viewed as an important measure of the success of certain businesses, especially those that utilize our metrics to evaluate a variety of investments ranging from their internal operations to advertising initiatives. If the information that we provide to our customers, the media, or the public is inaccurate, or perceived to be inaccurate, whether due to inadequate methodological approaches, errors, biases towards certain available data sources or partners, disparate data sets across our products, defects or errors in data collection and processing (conducted by us or by third parties) or the systems used to collect, process or deliver data, our business may be harmed.\nAny inaccuracy, perceived inaccuracy or inconsistency in the data reported by us could lead to consequences that could adversely impact our operating results, including:\n\u2022\nloss of customers;\n\u2022\nsales credits, refunds or liability to our customers;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of substantial costs to correct any material defect, error or inconsistency;\n\u2022\nincreased warranty and insurance costs;\n\u2022\npotential litigation;\n\u2022\ninterruptions in the availability of our products;\n\u2022\ndiversion of development resources;\n\u2022\nlost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our products; and\n\u2022\ndamage to our brand.\nOur business may be harmed if we change our methodologies or the scope of information we collect.\nWe have in the past and may in the future change our methodologies, the methodologies of companies we acquire, or the scope of information we collect. Such changes may result from identified deficiencies in current methodologies, development of more advanced methodologies, changes in our business plans or in industry standards or regulatory requirements, changes in technology used by websites, browsers, mobile applications, servers, or media we measure, integration of acquired companies or expressed or perceived needs of our customers, potential customers or partners. Any such changes or perceived changes, or our inability to accurately or adequately communicate to our customers and the media such changes and the potential implications of such changes on the data we have published or will publish in the future, may result in customer dissatisfaction, particularly if certain information is no longer collected or information collected in future periods is not comparable with information collected in prior periods. As a result of future methodology changes, some of our customers that may also supply us with data may decide not to continue buying products or services from us or may decide to discontinue providing us with their data to support our products. Such customers may elect to publicly air their dissatisfaction with the methodological changes made by us, which may damage our brand and harm our reputation.\nIf we are not able to maintain panels of sufficient size and scope, or if the costs of establishing and maintaining our panels materially increase, our business could be harmed.\nWe believe that the quality, size and scope of our research panels are critical to our business. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to maintain panels of sufficient size and scope to provide the quality of marketing intelligence that our customers demand from our products. We anticipate that the cost of panel recruitment will continue to increase with the proliferation of proprietary and secure media content delivery platforms and evolving regulatory requirements, and that the difficulty in collecting these forms of data will continue to grow, which may require significant hardware and software investments, as well as increases to our panel incentive and panel management costs.\nWe have historically established and/or acquired new panels. We plan to continue to make significant investments in our panels in the future. Our panel costs may significantly increase our cost of revenues in the future. To the extent that such additional\nexpenses are not accompanied by increased revenues, our operating margins may be reduced and our financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales of our subscription-based products. If our customers terminate or fail to renew their subscriptions, our business could suffer.\nWe currently derive a significant portion of our revenues from our syndicated products, which are generally one-year subscription-based products. This has generally provided us with recurring revenue due to high renewal rates among our enterprise customers; however, syndicated digital revenue from our smaller and international customers declined in 2019. If additional customers terminate their subscriptions for our products, do not renew their subscriptions, delay renewals of their subscriptions or renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenues could decline and our business could suffer.\nOur customers have no obligation to renew after the expiration of their initial subscription period, and we cannot be assured that current subscriptions will be renewed at the same or higher dollar amounts, if at all. Furthermore, our newer subscription products, for which revenue is recognized based on impressions used, may be subject to higher fluctuations in revenue.\nOur customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate due to a number of factors, including customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our products, the costs or functionality of our products, the prices or functionality of products offered by our competitors, the health of the advertising marketplace, mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base, general economic conditions or reductions in our customers' spending levels.\nOur growth depends upon our ability to retain existing large customers and add new large customers. To the extent we are not successful in doing so, our ability to grow revenue and attain profitability and positive cash flow may be impaired.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to sell our products to large customers and on the renewal of these subscriptions and contracts to these customers in subsequent years. For the years ended 2019 and 2018, we derived 27% and 24%, respectively, of our total revenues from our top 10 customers. Uncertain economic conditions, changes in the regulatory environment or other factors, such as the failure or consolidation of large customer companies, internal reorganization or changes in focus, or dissatisfaction with our products, may cause certain large customers to terminate or reduce their subscriptions and contracts with us. The loss of any one or more of these customers could decrease our revenues and harm our current and future operating results. The addition of new large customers or increases in sales to existing large customers may require particularly long implementation periods and other significant upfront costs, which may adversely affect our profitability. To compete effectively, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, forced to offer significant discounts to maintain existing customers or acquire other large customers. In addition, we may be forced to reduce or withdraw from our relationships with certain existing customers or refrain from acquiring certain new customers in order to acquire or maintain relationships with important large customers. As a result, new large customers or increased usage of our products by large customers may cause our profits to decline, and our ability to sell our products to other customers could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to effectively persuade customers to buy our products in substitution for those of an incumbent services provider, our revenue growth may suffer.\nSome of our newer products require that we persuade prospective customers, or customers of our existing products, to buy our newer products in substitution for those of an incumbent service provider. In some instances, the customer may have built their systems and processes around the incumbent provider's products. Persuading such customers to switch service providers may be difficult and require longer sales cycles, affecting our ability to increase revenue in these areas. Moreover, the incumbent service provider may have the ability to significantly discount its services or enter into long-term agreements, which could further impede our ability to persuade customers to switch service providers, and accordingly, our ability to increase our revenues.\nWe may expand through investments in, acquisitions of, or the development of new products with assistance from, other companies, any of which may not be successful and may divert our management's attention.\nIn the past, we completed several strategic acquisitions. We also may evaluate and enter into discussions regarding an array of potential strategic transactions, including acquiring complementary products, technologies or businesses.\nAn acquisition, investment or business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, we may encounter difficulties integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of the acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to be employed by us, and we may have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in management and ownership. Acquisitions may also disrupt our ongoing business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business. Moreover, we cannot assure you that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment or business relationship would be realized timely, if at all, or that we would not be exposed to unknown liabilities. In connection with any such transaction, we may:\n\u2022\nencounter difficulties retaining key employees of the acquired company or integrating diverse business cultures;\n\u2022\nincur large charges or substantial liabilities, including without limitation, liabilities associated with products or technologies accused or found to infringe on third-party intellectual property rights or violate existing or future privacy regulations;\n\u2022\nissue shares of our capital stock as part of the consideration, which may be dilutive to existing stockholders;\n\u2022\nbecome subject to adverse tax consequences, legal disputes, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges;\n\u2022\nuse cash that we may otherwise need for ongoing or future operation of our business;\n\u2022\nenter new geographic markets that subject us to different laws and regulations that may have an adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022\nexperience difficulties effectively utilizing acquired assets;\n\u2022\nencounter difficulties integrating the information and financial reporting systems of acquired businesses, particularly those that operated under accounting principles other than those generally accepted in the U.S. prior to the acquisition by us; and\n\u2022\nincur debt, which may be on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay.\nWe also have entered into relationships with certain third-party providers to expand our product offerings, and we may enter into similar arrangements in the future. These or other future relationships or transactions may involve preferred or exclusive licenses, discount pricing or investments in other businesses to expand our sales capabilities. These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations, and though these transactions may provide additional benefits, they may not be profitable immediately or in the long term. Negotiating any such transactions could be time-consuming, difficult and expensive, and our ability to close these transactions may be subject to regulatory or other approvals and other conditions that are beyond our control. Consequently, we can make no assurances that any such transactions, investments or relationships, if undertaken and announced, would be completed or successful.\nThe impact of any one or more of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSystem failures, security breaches or delays in the operation of our computer and communications systems may harm our business.\nOur success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems and the third-party data centers we use. Our ability to collect and report accurate data may be interrupted by a number of factors, including the failure of our network or software systems, computer viruses, security breaches, or variability in user traffic on customer websites. A failure of our network or data gathering procedures, or those of our third-party data suppliers, could impede the processing of data, cause the corruption or loss of data, prevent the timely delivery of our products, or damage our brand and reputation.\nIn the future, we may need to expand our network and systems at a more rapid pace than we have in the past. Our network or systems may not be capable of meeting the demand for increased capacity, or we may incur additional expenses to accommodate these capacity demands. In addition, we may lose valuable data or be unable to obtain or provide data on a timely basis or our network may temporarily shut down if we fail to adequately expand or maintain our network capabilities to meet future requirements. Any lapse in our ability to collect or transmit data may decrease the value of our products and prevent us from providing the data requested by our customers and partners. Any disruption in our network processing or loss of internet user data may damage our reputation and result in the loss of customers, partners and vendors and the imposition of penalties or other legal or regulatory action, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to customer and partner security reviews, and failure to pass these reviews could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nMany of our customer and partner contracts require that we maintain certain physical and/or information security standards. Any failure to meet such standards could have an adverse impact on our business. In certain cases, we permit a customer or partner to audit our compliance with contractual standards. Negative findings in an audit and/or the failure to adequately remediate in a timely fashion such negative findings could cause customers or partners to terminate their contracts or otherwise have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, customers or partners from time to time may require new or stricter physical or information security than they negotiated in their contracts and may condition continued volumes and business on the satisfaction of such additional requirements. Some of these requirements may be expensive to implement or maintain and may not be factored into our contract pricing. Failure to meet these requirements could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on a small number of third-party service providers to host and deliver our products, and any interruptions or delays in services from these third parties could impair the delivery of our products and harm our business.\nWe host our products and serve our customers from data center facilities located throughout the U.S. While we operate our equipment inside these facilities, we do not control the operation of these facilities, and, depending on service level requirements and costs, we may not continue to operate or maintain redundant data center facilities for all of our products or for all of our data, which could increase our vulnerability. These facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They are also subject to break-ins, computer viruses, security breaches, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct. A natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in availability of our products. We may also encounter capacity limitations at our third-party data centers. Additionally, our data center facility agreements are of limited durations, and our data center facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We believe that we have good relationships with our data center facility vendors and believe that we will be able to renew, or find alternative data center facilities, on commercially reasonable terms, although there can be no guarantee of this. If we are unable to renew our agreements with the owners of the facilities on commercially reasonable terms, or if we migrate to a new data center, we may experience delays in delivering our products until an agreement with another data center facility can be arranged or the migration to a new facility is completed.\nIf we or the third-party data centers that we use were to experience a major power outage, we would have to rely on back-up generators, which may not function properly, and their supply may be inadequate. Such a power outage could result in the disruption of our business. Additionally, if our current facilities fail to have sufficient cooling capacity or availability of electrical power, we would need to find alternative facilities and could experience delays in delivering our products.\nWe currently leverage a large content delivery network (\"CDN\"), to provide services that allow us to offer a more efficient tagging methodology. If that network faced an outage or breach or the service became unavailable, an alternate CDN provider or additional capacity in our data centers would need to be established to support the large volume of tag requests that we currently manage, which would either require additional investments in equipment and facilities or a transition plan. This could unexpectedly raise our costs and could contribute to delays or losses in tag data that could affect the quality and reputation of our Media Metrix, vCE, cross-platform and other products that involve the measurement of a large amount of digitally transmitted activity across multiple providers.\nFurther, we depend on access to the internet through third-party bandwidth providers to operate our business. If we lose the services of one or more of our bandwidth providers for any reason, we could experience disruption in the delivery of our products or be required to retain the services of a replacement bandwidth provider. It may be difficult for us to replace any lost bandwidth on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, due to the large amount of bandwidth our operations require.\nAny errors, defects, breaches, disruptions or other performance problems related to our products or the delivery of our services caused by third parties could reduce our revenues, harm our reputation, result in the loss of customers, partners and vendors and the imposition of penalties or other legal or regulatory actions and otherwise damage our business. Interruptions in the availability of our products and the delivery of our services may reduce our revenues due to increased turnaround time to complete projects, cause us to issue credits or refunds to customers, cause customers to terminate their agreements or adversely affect our renewal rates. Our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected if there were errors or delays in delivering our products or services, including for reasons beyond our control, and our reputation would be harmed if our customers or potential customers believe our products and services are unreliable.\nOur restructuring activities and cost reduction initiatives may not deliver the expected results and could disrupt our business operations.\nAchieving our long-term profitability goals depends significantly on our ability to control our operating costs. If we are not able to identify and implement initiatives that control or reduce costs and increase operating efficiency, or if the initiatives we have implemented to date do not generate the expected cost savings, our financial results could be adversely affected. Our efforts to reduce cost have included restructuring activities involving workforce reductions, lease and contract terminations, and other cost reduction initiatives. Some of the operational improvements we have made to reduce our cost structure will require careful management to avoid disrupting customer, partner and employee relationships. If we do not successfully manage our restructuring activities, the expected benefits may be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted.\nOur review of strategic options may not be successful and could disrupt our business operations.\nDuring our November 5, 2019 earnings call, we reiterated that we are pursuing all strategic options and that our Board of Directors remains open to any financial or operational strategies that would maximize stockholder value, including the sale of our company. We cannot assure you that this review will result in the identification or consummation of any transaction, and our Board of Directors may determine that our most effective strategy is to continue to effectuate our current business plan. Any strategic decision\nwill involve risks and uncertainties, and we cannot assure our stockholders that any strategic option, if identified, evaluated and consummated, will provide greater value to our stockholders than that reflected in our current stock price. In addition, the process of negotiating any corporate transaction could be time-consuming and disruptive, and any transaction would be dependent on a number of factors that are beyond our control, including, among other things, regulatory or other approvals, the availability of financing to potential buyers on reasonable terms, market conditions, industry trends and the interest of third parties in our business. We also could incur substantial expenses associated with identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives, including those related to employee retention payments, equity compensation, severance pay and legal, accounting and financial advisory fees. Moreover, this process could divert our resources and require significant management time and attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business. It also could disrupt our customer and partner relationships, impair our ability to recruit and retain key personnel, increase our costs, and lead to legal disputes in connection with this process or any resulting transaction. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nFurther, we do not intend to disclose detailed developments or provide regular updates on the progress or status of this process until our Board of Directors deems further disclosure is appropriate or required. Accordingly, speculation regarding any developments related to this process and perceived uncertainties related to the future of our company could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly and may result in the loss of potential business opportunities.\nWe rely on our management team, many of whom were recently appointed to their roles, and may need additional personnel to operate and grow our business. The loss of one or more key employees, the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, or the failure to integrate new personnel could harm our business.\nIn 2019, we experienced a number of changes to our senior management team. Our success and future growth depend to a significant degree on the skills and continued services of our management team, many of whom were recently appointed to their roles. Our future success also depends on our ability to retain, attract and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing and customer service personnel, including members of our management team. We may experience a loss of productivity due to the departure of key personnel and the associated loss of institutional knowledge, or while new personnel integrate into our business and transition into their respective roles. This transition may not ultimately be successful.\nA substantial majority of our U.S. employees work for us on an at-will basis. We continually evaluate our personnel needs in all areas of our business, particularly in our sales, marketing, finance and technology development areas, both domestically and internationally, which could increase our recruiting and hiring costs in the foreseeable future. Competition for these types of personnel is intense, particularly in the internet and software industries. Our inability to retain and attract the necessary personnel could adversely affect our business.\nThe effectiveness of our equity awards as a means to recruit and retain key personnel has diminished, and we may need to grant equity awards outside of our existing plan.\nHistorically, we have relied on equity awards as one means of recruiting and retaining key personnel, including our senior management. Due to declines in our stock price, the effectiveness of our outstanding equity awards as a means to retain key personnel has diminished. Moreover, the quantity of equity awards we are able to grant under our 2018 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (\"2018 Plan\") is limited, both by plan design and by certain limitations in our outstanding warrants. These limits have impacted our ability to offer new awards to current and prospective employees. In order to address our retention and hiring needs, we may seek to amend our 2018 Plan and warrants to increase the number of shares available for future equity awards, or we may need to consider granting equity awards outside of our 2018 Plan. Either of these options could result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders. Alternatively, we may need to shift a larger portion of employee compensation to cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Results of Operations\nOur revenues and results of operations may fluctuate in the future. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If our revenues or results of operations do not meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the price of our Common Stock could decline substantially. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our revenues or results of operations include:\n\u2022\nour ability to increase sales to existing customers and attract new customers;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss or reduction in spending by significant customers;\n\u2022\nchanges in our customers' subscription renewal behaviors and spending on projects;\n\u2022\nthe impact of our contract renewal rates caused by our customers' budgetary constraints, competition, customer dissatisfaction, customer corporate restructuring or change in control, or our customers' actual or perceived lack of need for our products;\n\u2022\nthe timing of contract renewals, delivery of products and duration of contracts and the corresponding timing of revenue recognition;\n\u2022\nvariations in the demand for our products and the implementation cycles of our products by our customers;\n\u2022\nthe challenges of persuading existing and prospective customers to switch from incumbent service providers;\n\u2022\nthe timing of revenue recognition for usage-based or impression-based products;\n\u2022\nthe effect of revenues generated from significant one-time projects or the loss of such projects;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of new product introductions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing and discounting policies or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe impact of our decision to discontinue certain products;\n\u2022\nour failure to accurately estimate or control costs - including those incurred as a result of investments, other business or product development initiatives, legal proceedings, and the integration of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nthe cost and availability of data from third-party sources;\n\u2022\nadverse judgments or settlements, or increased legal fees, in legal disputes or government proceedings;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates under our senior secured convertible notes or other financing vehicles;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of capital expenditures and operating costs related to the maintenance and expansion of our operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nservice outages, other technical difficulties or security breaches;\n\u2022\nlimitations relating to the capacity of our networks, systems and processes;\n\u2022\nmaintaining appropriate staffing levels and capabilities relative to projected growth, or retaining key personnel;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to use equity awards to compensate current and prospective employees;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of organizational restructuring;\n\u2022\nthe risks associated with operating in countries in which we may have little or no previous experience and with maintaining or reorganizing corporate entity structures in international jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which certain expenses are deductible for tax purposes, such as share-based compensation that fluctuates based on the timing of vesting and our stock price;\n\u2022\nthe timing of any changes to our deferred tax valuation allowance;\n\u2022\nadoption of new accounting pronouncements;\n\u2022\nchanges in the fair value of our financing derivatives and warrants related to market volatility or management assumptions; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, political, regulatory, industry and market conditions and those conditions specific to internet usage and online businesses.\nWe believe that our revenues and results of operations on a year-over-year and sequential quarter-over-quarter basis may vary significantly in the future and that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. Investors are cautioned not to rely on the results of prior periods as an indication of future performance.\nWe may not be able to generate or obtain sufficient cash to service our debt and lease facilities or trade payables.\nWe currently have, and will likely continue to have, a substantial amount of indebtedness (in the form of our senior secured convertible notes (\"Notes\") and subsidiary term debt) and lease facilities, as well as trade payables, including expenses incurred in prior periods. These obligations could require us to use a large portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt and lease facilities and pay accrued expenses. They could also limit our flexibility to invest in our business and adjust to market conditions, which could impact our customer relationships and place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nWe expect to obtain the funds to pay our expenses and meet our financial obligations from cash flow from our operations and, potentially, from other debt and/or equity offerings. Accordingly, our ability to meet our obligations depends on our future performance and capital-raising activities, which will be affected by financial, business, contractual, economic and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Failure to meet our payment obligations to vendors could disrupt our supply of goods and services and impact our reputation, creditworthiness and relations with customers. It could also lead to costly litigation.\nIf our cash flow and capital resources prove inadequate to allow us to pay the interest and principal on our debt when due and meet our other financial obligations, we could face substantial liquidity challenges and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations, restructure or refinance our debt (which we may be unable to do on acceptable terms) or forego attractive business opportunities. In addition, the terms of our existing or future financing agreements may restrict us from pursuing these alternatives. Failure to meet our obligations under the Notes could lead to an Event of Default (as defined in the Notes), which could have important consequences including, potentially, forcing us into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nOur financial condition and results of operations could suffer and be adversely affected if we incur an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets.\nWe are required to test goodwill and intangible assets, annually and on an interim basis if an event occurs or there is a change in circumstance that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying values or indicate that the carrying value of such intangibles is not recoverable. When the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a charge to operations, up to the total amount of goodwill, is recorded. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable, a charge to operations is recognized. Either event would result in incremental expenses for that period, which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred. We recorded a $224.3 million impairment charge related to goodwill and a $17.3 million impairment charge for our strategic alliance intangible asset in the second quarter of 2019.\nOur impairment analysis is sensitive to changes in key assumptions used in our analysis, such as expected future cash flows, the degree of volatility in equity and debt markets and our stock price. Additionally, changes in our strategy or significant technical developments could significantly impact the recoverability of our intangible assets. If the assumptions used in our analysis are not realized, it is possible that an additional impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future. We cannot predict the amount and timing of any future impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets.\nChanges in the fair value of our derivative financial instruments or warrants could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financing derivatives, including the interest rate reset feature and change of control redemption features of our Notes, and our warrants are classified as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We use various models and assumptions to determine the fair value of these liabilities, including assumptions with respect to market rates, the price and volatility of our Common Stock, the probability of occurrence of certain events, and term. Any change in our assumptions could result in a change in the fair value of our derivative liabilities and warrants, which would be recorded to earnings and could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may encounter difficulties managing our costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe believe that we will need to continue to effectively manage our organization, operations and facilities in order to accommodate changes in our business and to successfully integrate acquired businesses. If we continue to grow or change, either organically or through acquired businesses, our current systems and facilities may not be adequate and may need to be expanded or reduced. For example, we may be required to enter into leases for additional facilities or commit to significant investments in the build out of current or new facilities, or we may need to renegotiate or terminate leases to reflect changes in our business. If we are unable to effectively forecast our facilities needs or if we are unable to sublease or terminate leases for unused space, we may experience increased and unexpected costs. Moreover, our need to effectively manage our operations and cost structure requires that we continue to assess and improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.\nFrom time to time, as a result of acquisition integration initiatives, or through efforts to improve or streamline our operations, we have reduced our workforce or reassigned personnel, and we may do so in the future. Such actions may expose us to disruption by dissatisfied employees or employee-related claims, including claims by terminated employees who believe they are owed more compensation than we believe these employees are due under our compensation and benefit plans, or claims maintained internationally in jurisdictions whose laws and procedures differ from those in the U.S.\nIf we are not able to efficiently and effectively manage our cost structure and resolve employee-related claims, or if we are unable to find appropriate space to support our needs, our business may be impaired.\nWe have a history of significant net losses, may incur significant net losses in the future and may not achieve profitability.\nWe incurred net losses of $339.0 million, $159.3 million and $281.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to achieve profitability in the future. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,108.1 million. Because a large portion of our costs are fixed, we may not be able to adequately reduce our expenses in response to any decrease in our revenues, which would materially and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our operating expenses may increase as we implement certain growth initiatives, which include, among other things, the development of new products and enhancements of our infrastructure. If our revenues do not increase to offset these increases in costs and operating expenses, our operating results would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur net operating loss carryforwards may expire unutilized or underutilized, which could prevent us from offsetting future taxable income.\nWe have experienced \"changes in control\" that have triggered the limitations of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code on a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards. As a result, we may be limited in the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that we can use in the future to offset taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we estimate our U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes are $639.9 million and $1,391.3 million, respectively, subject to limitation as described above. These net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2022 for federal income tax reporting purposes and portions are expiring annually for state income tax reporting purposes. The federal and certain state net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017 currently have an indefinite carryforward period as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"TCJA\").\nAs of December 31, 2019, we estimate our aggregate net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes related to our foreign subsidiaries are $5.1 million, which will begin to expire in 2024.\nWe apply a valuation allowance to our deferred tax assets when management does not believe that it is more-likely-than-not that they will be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all sources of taxable income, including potential opportunities for loss carrybacks, the reversal of existing temporary differences associated with our deferred tax assets and liabilities, tax planning strategies and future taxable income. We also consider other evidence such as historical pre-tax book income in making the determination.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we continue to have a valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets of our U.S. entities and certain foreign subsidiaries, including net operating loss carryforwards.\nWe have limited experience with respect to our pricing model for our new offerings, and if the fees we charge for our products are unacceptable to customers, our revenues and operating results will be harmed.\nMany of our customers purchase specifically tailored contracts that are priced in the aggregate. Due to the level of customization of such contracts, the pricing of contracts or individual product components of such packages may not be readily comparable across customers or periods. Existing and potential customers may have difficulty assessing the value of our products and services when comparing them to competing products and services. As the market for our products matures, or as competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours, we may be unable to renew our agreements with existing customers or attract new customers with the fees we have historically charged. As a result, it is possible that future competitive dynamics in our market may require us to reduce our fees, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues, profitability and operating results.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Compliance, Litigation and Tax Matters\nConcern over privacy violations and data breaches could lead to public relations problems, regulatory scrutiny and class action lawsuits, which could harm our business.\nWe are subject to data privacy and protection laws and regulations that apply to the collection, transmission, storage and use of proprietary information and personal information. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and data privacy varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is constantly evolving and increasingly demanding. The restrictions imposed by such laws continue to develop and may require us to incur substantial costs and fines or adopt additional compliance measures, such as notification requirements and corrective actions.\nAny perception of our practices, products or services as a violation of individual privacy rights may subject us to public criticism, loss of customers, partners or vendors, class action lawsuits, reputational harm, or investigations or claims by regulators, industry groups or other third parties, all of which could significantly disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability. (Refer to Footnote 11, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of certain legal proceedings in which we are involved.) Additionally, laws regulating privacy and third-party products purporting to address privacy concerns could negatively affect the functionality of, and demand for, our products and services, thereby resulting in loss of customers, partners and vendors and harm to our business.\nWe also rely on security questionnaires and contractual representations made to us by customers, partners, vendors and other third-party data providers that their own use of our services and the information they provide to us do not violate any applicable privacy laws, rules and regulations or their own privacy or security policies. As a component of our client contracts, we obligate customers to provide their consumers the opportunity to obtain the appropriate level of consent (including opt outs) for the information collection associated with our services, as applicable, or provide another appropriate legal basis for collection. If these questionnaires or representations are false, inaccurate or incomplete, or if our customers, partners, vendors and other third-party data providers do not otherwise comply with applicable privacy laws or security practices, we could face adverse publicity and possible legal or regulatory action.\nOutside parties, including foreign actors, may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees or users of our solutions to disclose sensitive information via illegal electronic spamming, phishing, threats or other tactics. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain physical access to our information systems. This risk may be heightened in U.S. election years, particularly from foreign governments and other foreign actors. Any breach of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unauthorized dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive, personal or confidential data about us, our employees or our customers, partners or vendors, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our employees, our customers or the individuals affected to risks of loss or misuse of this information. Any actual or potential breach of our security measures may result in litigation and potential liability or fines, governmental inquiry or oversight or a loss of customer confidence, any of which could harm our business and damage our brand and reputation, possibly impeding our present and future success in retaining and attracting new customers and thereby requiring time and resources to repair our brand.\nDomestic or foreign laws, regulations or enforcement actions may limit our ability to collect and incorporate media usage information in our products, which may decrease their value and cause an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by existing or future laws, regulations or actions by domestic or foreign regulatory agencies, or by our customers' or partners' efforts to comply with these laws. For example, privacy, data protection and personal information, intellectual property, advertising, data security, data retention and deletion, protection of minors, consumer protection, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions concerns could lead to legislative, judicial and regulatory limitations on our or our partners' ability to collect, maintain and use information about consumers' behavior or media consumption in the U.S. and abroad. This could impact the amount and quality of data in our products.\nState and federal laws within the U.S. and foreign laws and regulations are varied, and at times conflicting, resulting in higher risk related to compliance. A number of new laws coming into effect and/or proposals pending before federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies will likely affect our business. For example, the European Union\u2019s (\"EU\") General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, became effective in May 2018, imposing more stringent EU data protection requirements and providing for greater penalties for noncompliance. In addition, regulators in the EU and elsewhere are increasingly focused on consent and the collection of data using tracking technologies, including recent guidance from the United Kingdom (\"UK\") Information Commissioner's Office. Adding further uncertainty is the UK's recent departure from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. Among other things, it is unclear how data transfers to and from the UK will be regulated. As another example, Brazil recently enacted the General Data Protection Law, and the State of California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\"). The CCPA, which went into effect in January 2020, expands the scope of what is considered \"personal information\" and creates new data access and opt-out rights for consumers, which is impacting Comscore and other companies that operate in California, including many of our customers and partners. These U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change.\nWe have implemented policies and procedures to comply with GDPR, CCPA, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (\"COPPA\") and other laws, and we continue to evaluate and implement processes and enhancements and monitor changes in laws and regulations. However, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country, state to state, and customer to customer, and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. Additionally, the costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, these and other laws, regulatory actions and customer or partner policies may prevent us from selling our products and have and may continue to increase the costs associated with selling our products, and may affect our ability to invest in or jointly develop products in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, failure to comply with these and other laws and regulations may result in, among other things, administrative enforcement actions and substantial fines, class action lawsuits, significant legal fees, and civil and criminal liability. Any regulatory or civil action that is brought against us, even if unsuccessful, may distract our management's attention, divert our resources, negatively affect our public image or reputation among our panelists, customers, partners and vendors, and harm our business.\nAn assertion from a third party that we are infringing its intellectual property rights, whether such assertion is valid or not, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses.\nThe media measurement, software and technology industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, domestically or internationally. As we grow and face increasing competition, the probability that one or more third parties will make intellectual property rights claims against us increases. In such cases, our technologies may be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. Additionally, many of our agreements may require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs if we have to defend such claims and may require that we pay damages and provide alternative services if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Intellectual property claims could harm our relationships with our customers, deter future customers from buying our products or expose us to litigation, which could be expensive and divert considerable attention of our management team from the normal\noperation of our business. Even if we are not a party to any litigation between a customer and a third party, an adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us to defend against intellectual property claims by the third party in any subsequent litigation in which we are a named party. Any of these results could adversely affect our brand, business and results of operations.\nWith respect to any intellectual property rights claim against us or our customers, we may have to pay damages or stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party's rights. We may have to seek a license for the technology, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, may significantly increase our operating expenses or may significantly restrict our business activities in one or more respects. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if we prove successful in defending ourselves against such claims, we may incur substantial expenses and the defense of such claims may divert considerable attention of our management team from the normal operation of our business.\nThe success of our business depends in large part on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, service mark, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection. We endeavor to enter into agreements with our employees and contractors and with parties with whom we do business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology or the reverse engineering of our technology. We cannot make assurances that any additional patents will be issued with respect to any of our pending or future patent applications, nor can we assure that any patent issued to us will provide adequate protection, or that any patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or held to be unenforceable in actions against alleged infringers. Also, we cannot make assurances that any future trademark or service mark registrations will be issued with respect to pending or future applications or that any of our registered trademarks and service marks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights.\nWe have been named in a purported securities class action and may be named in further litigation or proceedings, which could require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nWe, our former Chief Executive Officer and our current Chief Financial Officer have been named as defendants in a putative class action complaint alleging that we failed to disclose material information concerning a disagreement relating to our business strategy. While we believe that we have substantial legal and factual defenses in this matter, we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation or any future proceedings against us. (Refer to Footnote 11, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of certain legal proceedings in which we are involved.)\nAny legal proceedings could involve substantial defense and other costs and, if decided adversely to us, could result in significant monetary damages, penalties and reputational harm. Although we maintain insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations, our insurance may not cover all claims that have been or may be brought against us, and insurance coverage may not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost in the future. As a result, we could be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, including pursuant to our indemnification obligations to directors and officers, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions. Any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation in, and to the tax laws and regulations of, multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate entity structure. We are also subject to transfer pricing laws with respect to our intercompany transactions, including those relating to the flow of funds among our companies. Adverse developments in these laws or regulations, or any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation thereof, in any applicable jurisdiction, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction, including the U.S., may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions. If any applicable tax authorities, including U.S. tax authorities, were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn certain cases, we have concluded that we do not need to collect sales and use, value added and similar taxes in jurisdictions in which we have sales. Sales and use, value added and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest or future requirements may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur annual effective income tax rate can change materially as a result of changes in our mix of U.S. and foreign earnings and other factors, including changes in tax laws and changes made by regulatory authorities.\nOur overall effective rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of total earnings before tax. However, income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis. Losses in one jurisdiction may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions and may cause an increase in our tax rate. Changes in statutory tax rates and laws, as well as audits by domestic and international authorities, could affect the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid by us. Changes in the mix of earnings (or losses) between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, among other factors, could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting a public company, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we would not otherwise incur if we were a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and the securities exchanges, require certain corporate governance practices for public companies. We have also implemented additional governance practices in connection with the settlement of past legal proceedings. Our management and other personnel have devoted and expect to continue to devote a substantial amount of time to public reporting requirements and corporate governance. These rules and regulations have significantly increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time-consuming and costly. We also have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial costs associated with internal control requirements. If these costs are not offset by increased revenues and improved financial performance, our financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected. These rules and regulations, together with current and past legal proceedings, also make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage if these costs continue to rise. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our Board of Directors or as executive officers.\nRisks Related to International Operations\nOur business could become increasingly susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nIn the past, we acquired various businesses with substantial presence or clientele in multiple Latin American, European and Asian countries. Prior to these acquisitions, we otherwise had limited experience operating in markets outside of the U.S. Our inexperience in operating our business outside of the U.S. may increase the risk that the international businesses in which we are engaged will not be successful. In addition, conducting international operations subjects us to risks that we have not generally faced in the U.S. These risks include:\n\u2022\nrecruitment and maintenance of a sufficiently large and representative panel both globally and in certain countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and expenses associated with tailoring our products to local and international markets as may be required by local customers and joint industry committees or similar industry organizations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in expanding the adoption of our server- or census-based web beacon data collection in certain countries or obtaining access to other necessary data sources;\n\u2022\ndifferences in customer buying behaviors;\n\u2022\nthe complexities and expense of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including the GDPR, LGPD, other privacy and data protection laws and regulations, and foreign anti-corruption laws, as well as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations, including complex and costly hiring, disciplinary, and termination requirements;\n\u2022\nthe complexities of foreign value-added taxes and the repatriation of earnings, particularly following the enactment of the TCJA;\n\u2022\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\npolitical, social and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks and security concerns;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates; and\n\u2022\nincreased accounting and reporting burdens and complexities.\nAdditionally, operating in international markets requires significant additional management attention and financial resources. We cannot be certain that the investments and additional resources required to establish and maintain operations in other countries will hold their value or produce desired levels of revenues or profitability. We cannot be certain that we will be able to comply with laws, rules, regulations or local guidelines to maintain and increase the size of the user panels that we currently have in various countries, that we will be able to recruit a representative sample for our audience measurement products or that we will be able to enter into arrangements with a sufficient number of website and mobile app content providers and/or television operators to allow us to collect information for inclusion in our products. In addition, there can be no assurance that internet usage and e-commerce will continue to grow in international markets. In addition, governmental authorities in various countries have different views regarding regulatory oversight of the internet, data protection and consumer privacy.\nThe impact of these risks could negatively affect our international business and, consequently, our financial condition and results of operations.\nExport controls and economic and trade sanctions laws could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws.\nOur business activities include the collection of survey data from panelists around the world, and such activities are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export controls and economic and trade sanctions laws, including the U.S. Commerce Department's Export Administration Regulations and sanctions administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties and reputational harm. (Refer to Footnote 11, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of an internal review we conducted and voluntary disclosure we filed with OFAC and the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security in 2018.)\nAlthough we take precautions to prevent the collection of survey data from panelists in embargoed countries that are subject to export controls and economic and trade sanctions under these laws and regulations, we have collected such data in the past, and there is a risk that we could collect such data in the future despite such precautions. We have implemented a number of additional screening and other measures designed to prevent such transactions with embargoed countries and other U.S. sanctions targets. Changes in the list of embargoed countries and regions or prohibited persons may require us to modify these procedures in order to comply with governmental regulations. Our failure to screen potential panelists properly could result in negative consequences to us, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in foreign currencies could have a significant effect on our operating results.\nWe operate in several countries in Latin America, Europe and Asia. A portion of our revenues and expenses from business operations in foreign countries are derived from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our operations in those countries. As such, we have exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with revenues and operating expenses of our foreign operations, but we do not currently enter into any hedging instruments that hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk. If we grow our international operations, or acquire companies with established business in international regions, our exposure to foreign currency risk could become more significant.\nThe UK's withdrawal from the EU, commonly known as Brexit, and the risk that other countries may follow suit could adversely affect our business.\nThe UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. Although certain separation issues have been resolved, there is still significant uncertainty with respect to the terms of the future relationship between the EU and the UK. Given the status of Brexit at this time, we are unable to predict the impact that it may have on our business. Among other things, we could experience lower growth in the region, increased foreign currency risk, greater restrictions on business with UK customers and data providers, and increased regulatory complexity. Brexit has also created uncertainty with regard to the regulation of data protection in the UK and data transfers to and from the UK. A change in such regulations, or other regulations, could increase our costs of doing business, or in some cases our ability to do business, and adversely impact our operations and financial results. There is also a risk that other countries may decide to leave the EU. We cannot predict the impact that any additional countries leaving the EU may have on our business, but any such impact could adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure and Financings\nRestrictive covenants in the agreements governing our current and future indebtedness could restrict our operating flexibility.\nThe agreements governing our existing debt, and debt we may incur in the future, contain, or may contain, affirmative and negative covenants that materially limit our ability to take certain actions, including our ability to incur debt, issue equity, pay dividends and repurchase stock, make certain investments and other payments, enter into certain mergers and consolidations, and encumber and dispose of assets. Our Notes also require us to maintain certain minimum cash balances, which may restrict our ability to invest in our business or may require us to invest less than we otherwise would. The minimum cash balance requirement under the Notes is currently $40.0 million.\nWe may require additional capital to support our business, and this capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new products or enhance our existing products, enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary businesses and technologies.\nAccordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our Common Stock. Any financing secured by us in the future could include restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions.\nAs a result of our settlement with the SEC relating to financial accounting and disclosure practices between February 2014 and February 2016, we are currently subject to a \"bad actor\" disqualification and are unable to rely on certain exemptions from registration under the federal securities laws, including Regulation D. In addition, we are an \"ineligible issuer\" as the term is defined under Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act. This could make it more difficult for us to raise necessary financing in the future.\nCapital and credit market conditions, adverse events affecting our business or industry, the tightening of lending standards, rising interest rates, negative actions by regulatory authorities or rating agencies, or other factors also could negatively impact our ability to obtain future financing or to refinance our outstanding indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. In addition, the terms of any additional equity or debt issuances may adversely affect the value and price of our Common Stock, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe interest rate reset feature of our Notes subjects us to interest rate risk, which has caused our debt service obligations to increase and may continue to result in increased interest charges in future years.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk as a result of the interest rate reset feature of our $204.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding. The interest rate on our Notes is currently 12.0% per year (increased from 6.0% per year effective January 30, 2019) and resets on February 1, 2021 (the \"Interest Reset Date\"), based on the then-applicable conversion premium, which is calculated by dividing the conversion price of the Notes (set at $31.29 per share) by the arithmetic average of the volume-weighted average trading prices of our Common Stock on each of the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Interest Reset Date. Generally, as the conversion premium increases, the interest rate increases, and as the conversion premium decreases, the interest rate decreases. We are unable to forecast with any certainty the conversion premium as of the Interest Reset Date, and as a result, there can be no assurance that the interest rate on the Notes will decrease in future years.\nWe have the ability, subject to certain conditions, to pay interest on the Notes through the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock (\"PIK Interest Shares\") rather than cash. Any PIK Interest Shares would be valued based on the arithmetic average of the volume-weighted average trading prices of our Common Stock on each trading day during the ten consecutive trading days ending immediately before the applicable interest payment date. In 2019, we paid interest on the Notes in cash in January and in PIK Interest Shares in April, July and October. We issued an aggregate of 4,057,129 PIK Interest Shares in 2019. We paid interest on the Notes in cash in January 2020. If we elect to pay future interest on the Notes in cash, our cash flow will be negatively affected, which could have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. If we elect to pay interest on the Notes in PIK Interest Shares, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, particularly if our Common Stock continues to be subject to significant fluctuations in price.\nThe issuance of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of, or payment of interest on, our Notes and the exercise of warrants to purchase our Common Stock could substantially dilute your investment and could impede our ability to obtain additional financing.\nOur Notes are convertible into, and our warrants are exercisable for, shares of our Common Stock and give the holders thereof an opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our Common Stock such that conversion or exercise thereof will result in dilution of the equity interests of our stockholders. Further, the issuance of shares of our Common Stock, at our election, in lieu of cash, in payment of interest on the Notes, has and would result in dilution of the equity interests of our other stockholders, particularly if our Common Stock continues to be subject to significant fluctuations in price. Except for our Series B-2 warrants, which allow us to force an exercise in certain circumstances, we have no control over whether the holders of Notes and warrants will exercise their right, in whole or in part, to convert their Notes or exercise their warrants. Additionally, if we elect to pay interest on the Notes in shares of Common Stock, the number of PIK Interest Shares issuable would depend on the trading price of our Common Stock during the ten consecutive trading days ending immediately before the applicable interest payment date. For these reasons, we are unable to forecast or predict with any certainty the total number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Notes and warrants. The existence and potentially dilutive impact of the Notes and our warrants may prevent us from obtaining additional financing in the future on acceptable terms, or at all.\nThe terms of our Notes, our warrants and our registration rights agreement with certain investors could impede our ability to enter into corporate transactions or obtain additional financing and could result in our paying premiums or penalties to the holders of the Notes and warrants.\nThe terms of our Notes and our warrants require us, upon the consummation of any \"Fundamental Transaction\" (as defined in the Notes and the warrants), to cause any successor entity resulting from such Fundamental Transaction to assume all of our obligations under the Notes and warrants and the associated transaction documents. Further, the terms of the Notes and the warrants could impede our ability to enter into certain transactions or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe Notes and the warrants require us to deliver the number of shares of our Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise within a specified time period. If we are unable to deliver the shares of Common Stock within the timeframe required, we may be obligated to reimburse the holders for the cost of purchasing the shares of our Common Stock in the open market or pay them the profit they would have realized upon the conversion or exercise and sale of such shares.\nOur registration rights agreement with Starboard provides that in the event that the registration statement required to be filed under the Starboard registration rights agreement ceases to be effective and available to the selling stockholders party thereto under certain circumstances, we must pay to the selling stockholders on the 121st day after the occurrence of each such event and on every 30th day thereafter until the applicable event is cured, an amount equal to 1.0% of the Conversion Amount (as defined in the Notes), subject to a maximum of 3.0% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Notes for any 30-day period. Our registration rights agreement with CVI provides that in the event that the registration statement required to be filed under the CVI registration rights agreement ceases to be effective and available to the selling stockholders party thereto under certain circumstances, we must pay to the selling stockholder on the date of the occurrence of each such event and on every 30th day thereafter until the applicable event is cured, an amount equal to 2.0% of the Purchase Price (as defined in the CVI purchase agreement), subject to a maximum of 8.0% of the Purchase Price.\nThe payments we may be obligated to make to the holders of the Notes and our warrants described above may adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe may be obligated to redeem our Notes at a premium upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Notes) or a Change of Control (as defined in the Notes).\nIf we fail to comply with the various covenants in our Notes, including the financial covenants, we could be in default. Upon an Event of Default under the Notes, we could be required to redeem the Notes at a premium. In addition, upon the occurrence of specific kinds of Change of Control events, we will be required to offer to redeem the Notes at a premium as set out in the Notes.\nIn either event, the source of funds for any such redemption would be our available cash or, possibly, other financing. We may not be able to redeem the Notes pursuant to the terms thereof because we may not have the financial resources to do so, and no assurances can be provided as to our ability to obtain other requisite financing in amounts, or at times, as may be needed. Our failure to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control in accordance with the terms thereof would also result in an Event of Default under the Notes. In the event the holders of the Notes exercised their rights thereunder and we were unable to redeem the Notes, it could have important consequences including, potentially, forcing us into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nRisks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our Common Stock may be subject to significant fluctuations and volatility, and our stockholders may be unable to resell their shares at a profit.\nThe stock markets, in general, and the markets for technology stocks in particular, have experienced high levels of volatility. The market for technology stocks has been extremely volatile and frequently reaches levels that bear no relationship to the past or present operating performance of those companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock. In addition, our Common Stock has been subject to significant fluctuations in price, particularly over the past year, and may continue to experience fluctuations or declines.\nThe price of our Common Stock in the market may be higher or lower depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. It is possible that, in future quarters, our operating results may be below the expectations of analysts or investors, or we may take actions (including additional equity or debt financings) or have additional changes in management that are negatively perceived by the market. As a result of these and other factors, the price of our Common Stock may decline, possibly materially. These fluctuations could cause an investor to lose all or part of their investment in our Common Stock.\nThe Company's outstanding securities, the stock or securities that we may become obligated to issue under existing or future agreements, and certain provisions of those securities, may cause immediate and substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.\nOur existing stockholders have and may continue to experience substantial dilution as a result of our obligations to issue shares of Common Stock.\nThe total principal amount of Notes held by Starboard as of December 31, 2019 was $204.0 million. The Notes are convertible, at the option of Starboard, into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of $31.29 per share. Interest on the Notes is payable, at our option, in cash or through the issuance of PIK Interest Shares. Any PIK Interest Shares so issued are valued at the arithmetic average of the volume-weighted average trading prices of our Common Stock on each trading day during the ten consecutive trading days ending immediately preceding the applicable interest payment date. We issued PIK Interest Shares in April, July and October 2019, and we may issue PIK Interest Shares in the future.\nIn addition, we have the right to conduct a rights offering (the \"Rights Offering\") for up to $150.0 million in senior secured convertible notes (the \"Rights Offering Notes\"). The Rights Offering Notes would be substantially similar to the Notes, except with respect to, among other things, the conversion price thereof, which would be equal to 130% of the closing price of our Common Stock on the last trading day immediately prior to the commencement of the Rights Offering (subject to a conversion price floor of $28.00 per share). Interest on the Rights Offering Notes would also be payable, at our option, in cash or through the issuance of PIK Interest Shares.\nPursuant to the CVI purchase agreement, we granted to CVI warrants to initially purchase up to 11,654,033 shares of Common Stock. As of December 31, 2019, following exercise of the Series C warrant, 8,925,520 shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to the CVI warrants.\nAs of December 31, 2019, 1,538,967 shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding stock options under our equity incentive plans, 2,660,236 shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding restricted stock unit awards under our equity incentive plans, and 1,871,778 shares of Common Stock were available for future equity awards under our 2018 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan.\nThe issuance of shares of Common Stock (i) upon the conversion of the Notes or the Rights Offering Notes (if issued), (ii) as payment-in-kind of interest on any such notes through the issuance of PIK Interest Shares, (iii) upon the exercise of warrants, (iv) pursuant to outstanding and future equity awards, or (v) upon the conversion of other existing or future convertible securities, may result in substantial dilution to each of our stockholders by reducing that stockholder's percentage ownership of our outstanding Common Stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and under Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our Common Stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our Common Stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous.\nThese provisions:\n\u2022\nprovide for a classified board of directors so that not all members of our Board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nauthorize \"blank check\" preferred stock that our Board could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which means that all stockholder actions must be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that the Board is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nprovide for advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \"interested\" stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \"interested\" stockholder and which may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company.\nShareholder activists could cause a disruption to our business.\nWe have been and may in the future be subject to legal and business challenges in the operation of our company due to actions instituted by activist shareholders or others, such as shareholder proposals, media campaigns, proxy contests and other such actions. Responding to proxy contests or such other actions has been and could continue to be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our Board and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism or potential changes to the composition of our Board may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, loss of potential business opportunities, instability or lack of continuity. This may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. In addition, actions of activist shareholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.", "PERMNO": 92102, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "SCOR"}
