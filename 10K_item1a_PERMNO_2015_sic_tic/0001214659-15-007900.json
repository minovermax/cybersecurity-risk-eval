{"cik": "47518", "company": "Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-11-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves risks. The following information about these risks should be considered carefully together with the other information contained herein. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not currently known or deemed immaterial also may result in adverse effects on our business.\nWe face significant uncertainty in the industry due to government health care reform, changes in Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental medical program reimbursements, and we cannot predict how these reforms will impact our operating results.\nIn March 2010, the U.S. Congress adopted and President Obama signed into law comprehensive health care reform legislation through the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act (H.R. 3590) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (H.R. 4872). We cannot predict with certainty what additional healthcare initiatives, if any, will be implemented at the federal or state level, or what the ultimate effect of federal health care reform or any future legislation or regulation will have on us. In addition, Medicare, Medicaid, managed care organizations and foreign governments are increasing pressure to both control health care utilization and to limit reimbursement. Changes in reimbursement programs or their regulations, including retroactive and prospective rate and coverage criteria changes, competitive bidding for certain products and services, and other changes intended to reduce expenditures (domestically or internationally), could adversely affect the portions of our businesses that are dependent on third-party reimbursement or direct governmental payments. Moreover, to the extent that our customers experience reimbursement pressure resulting in lower revenue for them, their demand for our products and services may decrease. The impact of the above mentioned items could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nFailure by us or our suppliers to comply with the FDA regulations and similar foreign regulations applicable to the products we manufacture or distribute could expose us to enforcement actions or other adverse consequences.\nWe design, manufacture, install and distribute medical devices that are regulated by the FDA in the U.S. and similar agencies in other countries. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in future product recalls, injunctions preventing the shipment of products or other enforcement actions that could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. In March 2012, we received a warning letter from the FDA following an inspection by the FDA at our Batesville, Indiana production facilities. Upon the successful completion of our remediation efforts, the warning letter was lifted in September 2015. Additionally, certain of our suppliers are subject to FDA regulations, and the failure of these suppliers to comply with regulations could adversely affect us; as regulatory actions taken by the FDA against those manufacturers can result in product shortages, recalls or modifications.\nWe could be subject to substantial fines or damages and possible exclusion from participation in federal health care programs if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our business.\nWe are subject to stringent laws and regulations at both the federal and state levels governing the participation of durable medical equipment suppliers in federal and state health care programs. In addition, in 2011 we entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement with the U.S. Federal government, which imposes on us additional contractual obligations.\nFrom time to time, the government seeks additional information related to our claims submissions, and in some instances government contractors perform audits of payments made to us under Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health care programs. On occasion, these reviews identify overpayments for which we submit refunds. At other times, our own internal audits identify the need to refund payments. The frequency and intensity of government audits and review processes has intensified and we expect this will continue in the future, due to increased resources allocated to these activities at both the federal and state Medicaid level, and greater sophistication in data review techniques.\nIf we are deemed to have violated these laws and regulations, or are found to have violated our Corporate Integrity Agreement, we could be subject to substantial fines, damages, possible exclusion from participation in federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and possible recoupment of overpayments. While we believe that our practices materially comply with applicable state and federal requirements, the requirements may be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with our interpretation. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, even if inadvertent, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe participate in a highly competitive industry that is subject to the risk of declining demand and pricing pressures, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nDemand for our products and services depend in large part on overall demand in the health care market. Additionally, with the health care market\u2019s increased focus on hospital asset and resource efficiency as well as reimbursement constraints, spending for many of our products is on a long-term declining trend. Further, the competitive pressures in our industry could cause us to lose market share unless we increase our expenditures or reduce our prices, which would adversely impact our operating results. The nature of this highly competitive marketplace demands that we successfully introduce new products into the market in a cost effective manner (more fully detailed below). These factors, along with others, may result in significant shifts in market share among the industry's major participants, including us. Accordingly, if we are unable to effectively differentiate ourselves from our competitors in terms of both new products and diversification of our product portfolio through business acquisitions, then our market share, sales and profitability could be adversely impacted through lower volume or decreased prices.\nOur future financial performance will depend in part on the successful introduction of new products into the marketplace on a cost-effective basis.\nOur future financial performance will depend in part on our ability to influence, anticipate, identify and respond to changing consumer preferences and needs. We can provide no assurances that our new products will achieve the same degree of success as in the past. We may not correctly anticipate or identify trends in consumer preferences or needs, or may identify them later than competitors do. In addition, difficulties in manufacturing or in obtaining regulatory approvals may delay or prohibit introduction of new products into the marketplace. Further, we may not be able to develop and produce new products at a cost that allows us to meet our goals for profitability. Warranty claims and service costs relating to our products may be greater than anticipated, and we may be required to devote significant resources to address any quality issues associated with our new products, which could reduce the resources available for further new product development and other matters. In addition, the introduction of new products may also cause customers to defer purchases of existing products.\nFailure to successfully introduce new products on a cost-effective basis, or delays in customer purchasing decisions related to the evaluation of new products, could cause us to lose market share and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nAdverse developments in general domestic and worldwide economic conditions and instability and disruption of credit markets could have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or liquidity.\nWe are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions, including recession or economic slowdown and disruption of domestic and international credit markets. The credit and capital markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption over the past several years, leading to periods of recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending. These recessionary conditions caused customers to reduce, modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services. If our customers reduce investments in capital expenditures or utilize their limited capital funds to invest in products that we do not offer or that do not comprise a large percentage of our product portfolio, it could negatively impact our operating results. Moreover, even if our revenue remains constant, our profitability could decline if there is a shift to sales of product mix or geographic locations with less favorable margins. If worldwide economic conditions worsen, we would expect our customers to scrutinize costs resulting from pressures on operating margin due to rising supply costs, reduced investment income and philanthropic giving, increased interest expense, reimbursement pressure, reduced elective healthcare spending and uncompensated care.\nWe may not be able to grow if we are unable to successfully acquire and integrate, or form business relationships with, other companies.\nWe have in the past, and expect in the future, to grow our business through mergers, acquisitions and other similar business arrangements. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or business relationships, negotiate acceptable terms for such acquisitions or relationships or receive necessary financing on acceptable terms. Additionally, we may become responsible for liabilities associated with businesses that we acquire to the extent they are not covered by indemnification from the sellers or by insurance. Even if we are able to consummate acquisitions, such acquisitions could be dilutive to earnings, and we could overpay for such acquisitions. Additionally, we may not be fully successful in our integration efforts or fully realize expected benefits from the integration. Our integration efforts may divert management and other resources from other important matters, and we could experience delays or unusual expenses in the integration process, including intangible asset impairments which could result in significant charges in our Statements of Consolidated Income. Moreover, the margins for these companies may differ from our historical gross and operating margins resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe assets in our pension plans are subject to market disruptions. In addition, our pension plans are underfunded.\nOur primary pension plan invests in a variety of equity and debt securities subject to market risks. Our pension plans were underfunded at September 30, 2015 by approximately $96.4 million. Market volatility and disruption could cause further declines in asset values or fluctuations in assumptions used to value our liability and expenses. If this occurs, we may need to make additional pension plan contributions and our pension expense in future years may increase.\nOur business is significantly dependent on major contracts with GPOs, IDNs, and certain other distributors and purchasers.\nA majority of our North American hospital sales and rentals are made pursuant to contracts with hospital GPOs. At any given time, we are typically at various stages of responding to bids and negotiating and renewing expiring GPO agreements. Failure to be included in certain of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, including capital and rental revenue.\nParticipation by us in such programs often requires increased discounting or restrictions on our ability to raise prices, and failure to participate or to be selected for participation in such programs may result in a reduction of sales to the member hospitals. In addition, the industry is showing an increased focus on contracting directly with health systems or IDNs (which typically represents influential members and owners of GPOs). IDNs and health systems often make key purchasing decisions and have influence over the GPO\u2019s contract decisions, and often request additional discounts or other enhancements. In addition, certain other distributors and purchasers have similar processes to the GPOs and IDNs and failure to be included in agreements with these other purchasers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIncreased prices for, or unavailability of, raw materials or sub-assemblies used in our products could adversely affect profitability or revenue. In particular, our results of operations could be adversely affected by high prices for metals, fuel, plastics and other petroleum based products. We also procure several raw materials and sub-assemblies from single suppliers.\nOur profitability is affected by the prices of the raw materials and sub-assemblies used in the manufacture of our products. These prices may fluctuate based on a number of factors beyond our control, including changes in supply and demand, general economic conditions, labor costs, fuel related delivery costs, competition, import duties, tariffs, currency exchange rates, and government regulation. Significant increases in the prices of raw materials or sub-assemblies that cannot be recovered through increases in the prices of our products could adversely affect our results of operations. There can be no assurance that the marketplace will support higher prices or that such prices and productivity gains will fully offset any commodity price increases in the future. We generally have not engaged in hedging transactions with respect to raw material purchases, but do enter into fixed price supply contracts at times. Future decisions not to engage in hedging transactions or ineffective hedging transactions may result in increased price volatility, potentially adversely impacting our profitability.\nOur dependency upon regular deliveries of supplies from particular suppliers means that interruptions or stoppages in such deliveries could adversely affect our operations until arrangements with alternate suppliers could be made. Several of the raw materials and sub-assemblies used in the manufacture of our products currently are procured only from a single source. If any of these sole-source suppliers were unable or unwilling to deliver these materials for an extended period of time we may not be able to manufacture one or more products for a period of time, and our business could suffer. We may not be able to find acceptable alternatives, and any such alternatives could result in increased costs. Difficulties in the credit markets could adversely affect our suppliers\u2019 access to capital and therefore their ability to continue to provide an adequate supply of the materials we use in our products.\nThe majority of our products are manufactured at a single facility or location, and the loss of one or more of these facilities or locations could prevent us from manufacturing all the various products we sell.\nWe manufacture the majority of our products in only a single facility or location. If an event occurred that resulted in material damage to one or more of these manufacturing facilities or we lacked sufficient labor to fully operate the facility, we may be unable to transfer the manufacture of the relevant products to another facility or location in a cost-effective or timely manner, if at all. This potential inability to transfer production could occur for a number of reasons, including but not limited to a lack of necessary relevant manufacturing capability at another facility, or the regulatory requirements of the FDA or other governmental regulatory bodies. Such an event would materially negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that vary by country which could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.\nInternational sales accounted for approximately 36 percent of our net sales in fiscal 2015. We anticipate that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales in the future. In addition, we have multiple manufacturing facilities and third-party suppliers that are located outside of the U.S. As a result, our international sales, as well as our sales in the U.S. of products produced or sourced internationally, are subject to risks and uncertainties that can vary by country, such as political instability, economic conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in tax laws, regulatory and reimbursement programs and policies, and the protection of intellectual property rights. In addition, our collections of international receivables are subject to economic pressures and the actions of some governmental authorities who have initiated various austerity measures to control healthcare and other governmental spending.\nUnfavorable outcomes related to uncertain tax positions could result in significant tax liabilities.\nWe have recorded tax benefits related to various uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. While we believe our positions are appropriate, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), state or foreign tax authorities could disagree with our positions, resulting in a significant tax payment.\nWe are involved on an ongoing basis in claims, lawsuits and governmental proceedings relating to our operations, as well as product liability or other liability claims that could expose us to adverse judgments or could affect the sales of our products.\nWe are involved in the design, manufacture and sale of health care products, which face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if our products are alleged to have caused injury or are found to be unsuitable for their intended use. Amongst other claims, we are, from time to time, a party to claims and lawsuits alleging that our products have caused injury or death or are otherwise unsuitable. It is possible that we will receive adverse judgments in such lawsuits, and any such adverse judgments could be material. Although we do carry insurance with respect to such matters, this insurance is subject to varying deductibles and self-insured retentions and may not be adequate to cover the full amount of any particular claim. In addition, any such claims could negatively impact the sales of products that are the subject of such claims or other products.\nWe may not be able to attract, retain and develop key personnel.\nOur future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Our success also depends on our continuing ability to attract, retain and develop highly qualified personnel, and as competition for such personnel is intense, there can be no assurance that we can do so in the future.\nThe combined company\u2019s business may suffer if it does not retain its senior management.\nAfter the Welch Allyn acquisition, the combined company\u2019s future success requires it to continue to attract and retain competent personnel. In particular, the combined company\u2019s future success will depend on its senior management. As a result of the merger, Hill-Rom\u2019s and Welch Allyn\u2019s current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future roles and the integration process. The loss of services of members of the combined company\u2019s senior management team could adversely affect its business until suitable replacements can be found. There may be a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and the combined company may be unable to locate or employ qualified personnel on acceptable terms.\nA portion of our workforce is unionized, and we could face labor disruptions that would interfere with our operations.\nApproximately 7 percent of our employees as part of our logistics and manufacturing operations in the U.S. work under collective bargaining agreements. We are also subject to various collective bargaining arrangements or national agreements outside the U.S. covering approximately 18 percent of our employees. Although we have not recently experienced any significant work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements, we cannot ensure that such a stoppage will not occur in the future. Our primary labor contract expires in January 2016. Inability to negotiate satisfactory new agreements or a labor disturbance at one of our principal facilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by new regulations relating to conflict minerals.\nIn August 2012, the SEC adopted new disclosures and reporting requirements for companies whose products contain certain minerals and their derivatives, namely tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold, known as conflict minerals. As of May 2014, companies are required to report annually whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and/or adjoining countries and in some cases to perform extensive due diligence on their supply chains for such minerals. The implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including cost related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products. Since our supply chain is complex and multilayered, we may be unable to ascertain with sufficient certainty the origins for these minerals or make a determination that that these minerals are DRC conflict free despite our due diligence procedures, which in turn may harm our reputation. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as DRC conflict free, which could harm our relationships with these customers and/or lead to a loss of revenue. These requirements also could have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals, and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at prices similar to the past, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability.\nWe may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions, and may experience business disruptions and adverse tax consequences associated with restructuring, realignment and cost reduction activities.\nOver the past few years we have initiated several restructuring, realignment and cost reduction initiatives. In the third quarter of 2015, we announced plans to close two facilities in a continuing effort to rationalize our global footprint. Also, in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we initiated a restructuring program to improve our cost structure by reducing our European manufacturing capacity and streamlining our global operations by, among other things, executing a back office process transformation program in Europe. While we expect to realize efficiencies from these actions, these activities may not produce the full efficiency and cost reduction benefits we expect. Further, such benefits may be realized later than expected, and the ongoing costs of implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated. If these measures are not successful or sustainable, we may undertake additional realignment and cost reduction efforts, which could result in future charges. Moreover, our ability to achieve our other strategic goals and business plans may be adversely affected and we could experience business disruptions with customers and elsewhere if our restructuring and realignment efforts prove ineffective.\nThese actions, the resulting costs, and delays or lower than anticipated benefits will also impact our foreign tax positions and may require us to record tax reserves against certain deferred tax assets in our international business, similar to the provision we recognized during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 with respect to France.\nWe are increasingly dependent on consistent functioning of our information technology systems and if we are exposed to any intrusions or if we fail to maintain the integrity of our data, our business could be materially affected.\nWe are increasingly dependent on consistent functioning of our information technology systems for our infrastructure and products. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, integration of acquisitions, and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information. In addition, third parties may attempt to hack into our products or systems and may obtain proprietary information. If we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers or suppliers, have difficulty attracting new customers or suppliers, have problems that adversely impact internal controls, have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers and suppliers, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach, or suffer other adverse consequences. Any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, corruption, or destruction of these systems, as well as any data breaches, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses related to the integration of Welch Allyn.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of Welch Allyn. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing, payroll, manufacturing, marketing and employee benefits. While we expect to incur integration and restructuring costs and other costs incurred to execute the transaction following completion of the merger in 2015 that are estimated to range between $35 million and $40 million, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings. Although we expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset incremental transaction, merger-related and restructuring costs over time, we cannot give any assurance that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term, or at all.\nSuccessful integration of Welch Allyn with Hill-Rom and successful operation of the combined company are not assured. Also, integrating Hill-Rom\u2019s business with that of Welch Allyn may divert the attention of management away from operations.\nWelch Allyn is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hill-Rom but will, at least initially, continue its operations on a basis that is largely separate from Hill-Rom\u2019s previously existing operations. There can be no assurance that Welch Allyn will be able to maintain and grow its business and operations. In addition, the market segments in which Welch Allyn operates may experience declines in demand and/or new competitors. Integrating and coordinating certain aspects of the operations and personnel of Welch Allyn with Hill-Rom will involve complex operational, technological and personnel-related challenges. This process will be time-consuming and expensive, may disrupt the businesses of either or both of the companies and may not result in the full benefits expected from the merger, including cost synergies expected to arise from supply chain efficiencies and overlapping general and administrative functions. The potential difficulties, and resulting costs and delays, include:\n\u00b7\nmanaging a larger combined company;\n\u00b7\nconsolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures;\n\u00b7\nissues in integrating manufacturing, warehouse and distribution facilities, research and development and sales forces;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties attracting and retaining key personnel;\n\u00b7\nloss of customers and suppliers and inability to attract new customers and suppliers;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems;\n\u00b7\nincompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing, administration and other systems and processes; and\n\u00b7\nunforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to the merger or Welch Allyn\u2019s business.\nAdditionally, the integration of Welch Allyn\u2019s operations, products and personnel may place a significant burden on management and other internal resources. The diversion of management\u2019s attention, and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process, could harm the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe have incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the Welch Allyn acquisition, and may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations.\nAs stated in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have entered into several new credit facilities which have resulted in a substantially higher level of leverage compared with prior periods. Based on assumed interest rates, leverage ratios and credit ratings, we expect our debt service obligations, comprised of principal and interest (excluding capital leases), during the 12 months following the completion of the merger to be approximately $150 million. As a result of this increase in debt, demands on our cash resources have increased. The increased level of debt could, among other things:\n\u00b7\nrequire us to dedicate a large portion of its cash flow from operations to the servicing and repayment of its debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;\n\u00b7\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nrestrict our ability to make strategic acquisitions or dispositions or to exploit business opportunities;\n\u00b7\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt;\n\u00b7\nadversely affect our credit rating, with the result that the cost of servicing our indebtedness might increase;\n\u00b7\nadversely affect the market price of Hill-Rom common stock; and\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to apply proceeds from an offering or asset sale to purposes other than the servicing and repayment of debt.", "PERMNO": 52716, "SIC": 2590, "TIC": "HRC"}
