{"cik": "72333", "company": "NORDSTROM INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business faces many risks. We believe the risks described below outline the items of most concern to us. In evaluating our Company, you should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the other information in this 2020 Annual Report. Before you buy our common stock or invest in our debt, you should know that making such an investment involves risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below. Any one of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline or a default on our debt payments, and you may lose all or a part of your investment. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.\nCOVID-19 RISKS\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn late 2019, COVID-19 emerged and spread worldwide. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and governmental authorities around the world have implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. These measures have adversely affected workforces, customers, consumer sentiment, economies and financial markets, and, along with decreased consumer spending, have led to an economic downturn in our markets. The fall and winter seasons have seen a resurgence of cases, hospitalizations and deaths, and as a result, some jurisdictions are re-imposing or considering re-imposing restrictions experienced in the spring of 2020.\nNumerous state and local jurisdictions have imposed, and others in the future may impose, shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, executive orders and similar government orders and restrictions for their residents to control the spread of COVID-19. Such orders, restrictions and changes in consumer behavior and merchandise mix have negatively impacted our operations, especially in our physical stores. The potential for further spread of COVID-19, including any variants of the virus, and the requirement to take action to limit the spread of the illness, has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on global economic conditions and our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOPERATIONAL\nWe have experienced disruptions within our business and our results for fiscal year 2020 were adversely impacted. We temporarily closed all of our physical stores beginning March 17, 2020 as a result of COVID-19 to do our part to help limit the spread of the virus. We reopened our stores by the end of the second quarter of 2020 in accordance with local restrictions and where we believed we could provide for the safety and well-being of our employees and customers. Due to the uncertainty of COVID-19 and the speed at which the pandemic continues to impact our markets, we are continuing to assess the situation in real time, including government-imposed restrictions, market by market. We also continue to see shifts in product and channel preferences, particularly an increase in demand in the ecommerce channel. In addition, the increase in certain of our employees working remotely has resulted in increased demand on our information technology infrastructure, which can be subject to failure, disruption or unavailability, and increased vulnerability to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents.\nWe, as well as our vendors and third-party service providers, have and will continue to experience adverse operational effects due to reduced operating hours, social distancing restrictions, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and the need to adapt to ever-changing operating procedures and protocols. To the extent that our employees contract COVID-19, it leads to slow-downs in business processes and other disruptions in business operations as we engage in contact tracing and seek to limit further spread of the virus. Moreover, to these more near-term impacts, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact COVID-19 will have on our longer-term operations as well, particularly with respect to our current mix of merchandise offerings, event-based categories, store traffic trends, employment relations and corporate culture.\nIn addition, the operations, supply chain and financial condition of many of our vendors have and will continue to be affected by COVID-19, who have had difficulty sourcing products or obtaining the financing necessary to manufacture the products they sell to us. As a result, the business disruptions caused by the spread of COVID-19 have impacted our ability to timely acquire the products we sell to our customers. To the extent our vendors may be unable to produce and sell to us the products our customers want, our business may be negatively impacted.\nECONOMIC\nWe have been, and expect to continue to be, negatively impacted by the deterioration in economic conditions caused by the spread of COVID-19 and the follow-on impact of that deterioration on discretionary consumer spending and changes in consumer behavior. Public concern regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 has materially and adversely affected our business, as government-imposed operating restrictions intended to limit the spread of the virus have reduced store traffic, and even in the absence of such restrictions some customers have been cautious about visiting many of the high-traffic locations in which we operate our stores for fear of being exposed to the virus. The pandemic has impeded economic activity for an extended period and is expected to continue to do so, even as restrictions are lifted, leading to a continuation of the already significant decrease in per capita income and disposable income, increased and sustained unemployment or a decline in consumer confidence, any of which could significantly reduce discretionary spending.\nWhile this is expected to be temporary and it is challenging to accurately predict the ultimate impact of the pandemic, we expect our results in the foreseeable future to continue to be impacted by COVID-19 and its associated economic challenges. We are unable to accurately predict the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our operations going forward due to uncertainties which will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue, which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, actions taken to limit the spread, and the public\u2019s willingness to comply with such actions, the availability, efficacy, including the duration and protection level, and degree of public acceptance of vaccines and other treatments for COVID-19, the large scale and challenging logistics of producing and distributing the vaccines and the impact of governmental regulations that might be imposed in response to the pandemic.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below, such as those risks relating to our level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness and other liabilities, our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness, our ability to attract, retain, train and develop our future leaders, the performance of our credit card program with TD Bank and our ability to maintain our relationships with our customers, vendors, landlords and employees.\nNordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 11\nSTRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL RISKS\nIf we are unable to successfully execute our customer strategy or evolve our business model, it could negatively impact our business and future profitability and growth.\nThe retail environment is rapidly evolving. Customer shopping preferences continue to shift, including to digital channels, reducing traffic in malls and increasing expectations on faster delivery of product. In addition, the retail environment is under significant pressure from non-traditional retailers, including the pressure from the emergence of rental and recommerce companies. In this changing landscape, we continue to focus on better serving our customers through three priorities with significant potential for growth: market strategy, Nordstrom Rack brand and our digital business. Our market strategy focuses on our customers by providing a differentiated and seamless experience in a digital world by bringing all of our assets together in one market to serve customers when, where and how they want by connecting physical and digital assets. We will expand our price range and continue to leverage our digital and physical assets to increase selection and improve profitability in our Nordstrom Rack brand. As a majority digital business, we are well positioned to support our customers with a scalable platform that has been built to support many years of growth.\nOur focus on the customer requires us to execute new supply chain capabilities and enhance existing ones, develop applications for electronic devices, improve customer-facing technology, deliver purchased products timely, enhance inventory management systems and allow greater and more fluid inventory availability between digital and retail locations through our market strategy. In addition, these strategies will require further expansion and reliance on data science and analytics. This business model has a highly variable cost structure driven by fulfillment and marketing costs and will continue to require investments in cross-channel operations and supporting technologies.\nIf we do not successfully implement our customer strategy, including thoroughly understanding and delivering on our customer needs and wants, effectively integrating our digital channels and stores and scaling our market strategy, expanding our supply chain initiatives, and efficiently getting product to our customers, we may fall short of our customers\u2019 expectations, impacting our brand, reputation, profitability and growth.\nOur business could suffer if we do not appropriately assess and react to competitive market forces and changes in customer behavior.\nWe compete with other international, national, regional and local retailers, including internet-based businesses, omni-channel department stores, specialty stores, off-price stores and boutiques, which may carry similar lines of merchandise. Digital channels continue to facilitate comparison shopping, intensifying competition in the retail market, and marketing digitally is controlled by a few key platforms. If we fail to adequately anticipate and respond to customer and market dynamics, we may lose market share or our ability to remain competitive, causing our sales and profitability to suffer. If the efficiency and allocation of loyalty marketing, advertising and promotional campaigns that attract customers through various programs and media, including digital media and print, is unsuccessful in influencing consumer behavior in our digital channels and stores, or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are, our growth and profitability could suffer. We also may not gather accurate and relevant data or effectively utilize that data, which may impact our strategic planning, marketing and loyalty programs and our overall decision making. In addition, if we do not efficiently scale our business, or if customers shift to digital channels at a different pace than we anticipate, we may need to quickly modify our initiatives and investments in our digital and store environments, or in Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack to accommodate changes in consumer behavior and expectations, which may adversely impact our growth and profitability.\nOur customer relationships and sales has been and may be negatively impacted if we do not anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends or manage inventory levels appropriately.\nOur ability to predict or respond to constantly changing fashion trends, demographics, consumer preferences and spending patterns significantly impacts our sales and operating results. In addition, we are expanding our brand partnership model, including strategic brands, wholesale, vertical brands, concession and other strategies, to curate an assortment that offers newness and greater selection. Some merchandise may take several months from the time we place a purchase order to the time it is received, and our ability to accelerate or modify that timeline or purchase order contents may be limited. If we do not identify and respond to emerging trends in consumer spending and preferences quickly enough, identify the right partners that align with our customer strategy, broaden or expand our category offering fast enough or in the right areas or develop, evolve, and retain our team's talent, mindset and technical skills to support changing operating models, we may harm our ability to retain our existing customers or attract new customers. Ensuring we optimize our inventory and improve the planning and management of inventory through use of data and analytics is critical to serving the customer, driving growth and maximizing profitability. If we purchase too much inventory, we may be forced to sell our merchandise at lower average margins, which could harm our business. Conversely, if we fail to purchase enough merchandise, or inventory does not arrive fast enough or as expected, we may lose opportunities for additional sales and potentially harm relationships with our customers.\nImprovements to our fulfillment, inventory, buying, vendor payment and accounting processes and systems could adversely affect our business if not successfully executed.\nOur business depends on accuracy throughout our product flow process. We are making investments to streamline and standardize our fulfillment, inventory, buying, vendor payments and accounting capabilities through changes in technology, methodologies and processes. If we encounter challenges associated with change management, inventory integrity and implementation of associated information technology or adoption of new processes, features or capabilities, our ability to continue to successfully execute or evolve our strategy with changes in the retail environment could be adversely affected. Or, if we are unable to maintain accurate, reliable and effective inventory tracking systems, which are critical to our integrated omni-channel business strategy, it may adversely impact our sales and profitability and may result in canceled orders and increased costs relative to our current expectations.\nIf we do not effectively design and implement our strategic and business planning processes to attract, retain, train and develop talent and future leaders, our business may suffer.\nWe rely on the experience of our senior management, who have specific knowledge relating to us and our industry that is difficult to replace, to execute our business strategies and objectives. We have succession plans in place and our Board of Directors reviews these succession plans. If our succession plans do not adequately cover significant and unanticipated turnover, the loss of the services of any of these individuals, or any resulting negative perceptions of our business, could damage our reputation and our business.\nAdditionally, our success depends on the talents and abilities of our workforce in all areas of our business, especially personnel that can adapt to complexities and grow their skillset across the changing environment. Specifically in 2020, a large portion of our corporate employees moved to a work-from-home model, and we continue to evaluate this model over the long-term. Our ability to successfully execute our customer strategy depends on acquiring, developing and retaining qualified talent with diverse sets of skills, especially functional and technology specialists that directly support our strategies. If we are unable to offer competitive compensation and benefits, appropriate training, or a compelling work environment, our culture may be adversely affected, our reputation may be damaged, and we may incur costs related to turnover. In the Seattle metropolitan area, where our corporate headquarters are located, we regularly compete for talent with many larger technology-focused companies which may increase market compensation, especially for certain employee groups.\nOur program agreement with TD, or changes to that agreement, could adversely impact our business.\nThe program agreement with TD was consummated on terms that allow us to maintain customer-facing activities while TD provides Nordstrom-branded payment methods and payment processing services. If we fail to meet certain service levels, TD has the right to assume certain individual servicing functions including managing accounts and collection activities. If we lose control of such activities and functions, if we do not successfully respond to potential risks and appropriately manage potential costs associated with the program agreement with TD, or if these transactions negatively impact the customer service associated with our cards, resulting in harm to our business reputation and competitive position, our operations, cash flows and earnings could be adversely affected, and especially impactful during periods when our earnings generated by the program agreement are a larger percentage of our overall company earnings. If, upon expiration of our current program agreement in 2024, a new contract has less favorable terms, our results could be negatively impacted. If TD became unwilling or unable to provide these services or if there are changes to the risk management policies implemented under our program agreement with TD, our results may be negatively impacted. If we lose control over certain servicing functions and TD is unable to successfully manage accounts and collection activities, it may heighten the risk of credit losses.\nDATA, CYBERSECURITY AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RISKS\nEven if we take appropriate measures to use or safeguard our information, network and environment from security breaches, our customers, employees and business could still be exposed to risk.\nWe and third-party providers access, collect, store and transmit sensitive and confidential Company, customer, and employee data and information, including consumer preferences and credit card information, all of which are subject to demanding and constantly changing privacy and security laws and regulations. A number of jurisdictions where we do business have enacted or are considering new privacy and data protection laws which impact our responsibilities with respect to this data, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Privacy Rights Act.\nWe have taken measures to help prevent a breach of our information security and comply with cybersecurity requirements by implementing safeguards and procedures designed to protect the security and confidentiality of, and the access to, such information. In addition, where possible, we require our third-party providers to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards and procedures. We, like many companies with an ecommerce presence, as well as several of our vendors, have suffered breaches of our cybersecurity in the past and are at risk for such breaches in the future.\nNordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 13\nAlthough we and our third-party providers have implemented measures to prevent intentional or inadvertent information security breaches, these measures do not completely eliminate cybersecurity risk. Security breaches and cyber incidents and their remediation, whether at our Company, our third-party providers or other retailers, could expose us to a risk of loss or unauthorized release of customer, employee or Company confidential information, litigation, investigation, regulatory enforcement action, penalties and fines, orders to stop any alleged noncompliant activity, information technology system failures or network disruptions, increased cyber-protection and remediation costs, financial losses, potential liability, or loss of customers\u2019, employees\u2019 or third-party providers\u2019 trust and business, any of which could adversely impact our reputation, competitiveness and financial performance. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur business may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.\nOur ability to transact with customers and operate our business depends on the efficient operation of various internal and third-party information technology systems, including cloud computing, data centers, hardware, software and applications, to manage certain aspects of our Company, including online and store transactions, logistics and communication, inventory and reporting systems. We seek to build quality and secure systems, select reputable system vendors and implement procedures intended to enable us to protect our systems when we modify them. We test our systems to address vulnerabilities and train our employees regarding practices to protect the safety of our systems.\nThere are inherent risks associated with modifying or replacing systems, and with new or changed relationships, including accurately capturing and maintaining data, realizing the expected benefit of the change and managing the potential disruption of the operation of the systems as the changes are implemented. Potential issues associated with implementing technology initiatives and the time and resources required to optimize the benefits of new elements of our systems and infrastructure could reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term.\nIf we encounter an interruption or deterioration in critical systems or processes or experience the loss of critical data, which may result from security or cybersecurity threats or attacks, natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or third-party or other disruptions, our business could be harmed both in the short-term and over a longer period. Depending on the severity of the failure, our disaster recovery plans may be inadequate or ineffective. These events could also damage our reputation, result in increased costs or loss of sales and be expensive and time-consuming to remedy.\nREPUTATION AND THIRD PARTY RISKS\nOur customer, employee, vendor, third-party partner, landlord and other stakeholder relationships could be negatively affected if we fail to maintain our corporate culture and reputation.\nWe have a well-recognized culture and reputation that consumers may associate with a high level of integrity, customer service and quality merchandise, and it is one of the reasons customers shop with us and employees choose us as a place of employment. Any significant damage to our reputation, including damages arising from our business, privacy, diversity, environmental or social responsibility practices, or factors outside our control or on social media, could diminish customer trust, weaken our vendor relationships, reduce employee morale and productivity and lead to difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified employees. Additionally, management may not accurately assess the impact of significant legislative changes, including those that relate to privacy, employment matters, labor issues, environmental compliance and health care, impacting our relationship with our customers or our workforce and adversely affecting our sales and operations.\nOur business depends on third parties for the production, supply or delivery of goods, and a disruption could result in lost sales or increased costs.\nTimely receipts of quality merchandise from third parties is critical to our business. Additionally, we expect our business model to transition more toward direct-to-customer from wholesale over time. Our process to identify qualified vendors and access quality products in an efficient manner on acceptable terms and cost can be complex. Vendors and factors may also be subject to credit capacity limits that restrict shipments. In addition, we rely on a limited number of carriers to fulfill our product to customers. Violations of law or global standards with respect to human rights, quality and safety by any of our importers, manufacturers or distributors, or parties upstream within their respective supply chains, could result in delays in shipments and receipt of goods or damage our reputation, resulting in lost sales. These vendors may experience supply chain or port disruptions or other difficulties due to economic, political, environmental or epidemic conditions. The countries in which merchandise is manufactured could become subject to new trade restrictions, including increased customs restrictions, tariffs or quotas. Additionally, changes in tax and trade policies that impact the retail industry, such as increased taxation on imported goods, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe are party to contracts, transactions and business relationships with various third parties, including vendors, suppliers, service providers, landlords and lenders, who may have performance, payment and other obligations to us. If any of the third parties with which we do business become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar insolvency proceedings, our rights and benefits in relation to our contracts, transactions and business relationships with such third parties could be terminated, modified in a manner adverse to us, or otherwise impaired. We cannot make any assurances that we would be able to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as our existing contracts, transactions or business relationships, if at all. Any inability on our part to do so could negatively affect our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nDistribution and marketing of, and access to, our products depends on a variety of third-party publishers and platforms. If these third parties limit, prohibit or otherwise interfere with or change the terms of the distribution, use or marketing of our products, it could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe market and distribute our products through a variety of third-party publisher and platform channels. Our ability to market our brands on any given property or channel is subject to the policies of that channel. There is no guarantee that popular platforms will continue to feature our products, or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular mobile operating systems, such as Android or iOS, websites, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control. Any changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, websites or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, websites, handset manufacturers, or mobile carriers, or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our products\u2019 functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products or give preferential treatment to competitors, limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads, or our delivery of ads could materially adversely affect the usage of our products on mobile devices.\nAdditionally, mobile operating systems and websites have identifiers within their platforms that advertisers use to deliver personalized and targeted advertising. If or when these platforms are modified, requiring users to \u201copt in\u201d for advertiser access to the users\u2019 identifier or restrict customer tracking ability, it may limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads, which may result in a decline in the usage of our mobile applications on mobile devices or ability to target customers effectively. We also cannot predict the rate at which users will opt-in to grant identifier access. As a consequence, the ability of advertisers to accurately target and measure their advertising campaigns at the user level may become significantly limited.\nThe concentration of stock ownership in a small number of our shareholders may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to influence corporate matters and impact the price of our shares.\nWe have regularly reported in our annual proxy statements the holdings of members of the Nordstrom family, including Bruce A. Nordstrom, our former Co-President and Chairman of the Board, his sister Anne E. Gittinger and members of the Nordstrom family within our Executive Team. As of March 10, 2021, these individuals beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 31% of our common stock. As a result, either individually or acting together, they may be able to exercise considerable influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors or other matters impacting our management or corporate governance. In addition, as reported in our periodic filings, our Board of Directors has from time to time authorized share repurchases. While these share repurchases may be offset in part by share issuances under our equity incentive plans and as consideration for acquisitions, the repurchases may nevertheless have the effect of increasing the overall percentage ownership held by these shareholders. The corporate law of the State of Washington, where we are incorporated, provides that approval of a merger or similar significant corporate transaction requires the affirmative vote of two-thirds of a company\u2019s outstanding shares. The interests of these shareholders may differ from the interests of our shareholders as a whole, and the beneficial ownership of these shareholders may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire us, delay or otherwise prevent a significant corporate transaction because the consummation of any such transaction would likely require their approval. As a result of any of these factors, the market price of our common stock may be affected.\nINVESTMENT AND CAPITAL RISKS\nIf we fail to appropriately manage our capital, we may negatively impact our operations and shareholder return.\nWe utilize working capital to finance our operations, pay for capital expenditures and acquisitions, manage our debt levels and return value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Sufficient cash and liquidity are necessary to fund our business. Changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict access to a potential source of liquidity. A deterioration in our capital structure or the quality and stability of our earnings could result in noncompliance with our debt covenants or a downgrade of our credit rating, constraining the financing available to us. If our access to financing is restricted or our borrowing costs increase, our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Further, if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns, or we do not maintain financial flexibility, our operations, cash flows and returns to shareholders could be adversely affected.\nNordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 15\nOwning and leasing real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses.\nWe own or lease the land, buildings and equipment for all of our Supply Chain Network facilities, stores and corporate locations and are therefore subject to all of the risks associated with owning and leasing real estate. In particular, the value of the assets could decrease, their operating costs could increase, or facilities or stores may not be opened as planned due to changes in the real estate market, demographic trends, site competition, dependence on third-party performance or overall economic environment or may remain constrained as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we are potentially subject to liability for environmental conditions, exit costs associated with disposal of a store and commitments to pay base rent for the entire lease term or operate a store for the duration of an operating covenant. In addition, the invalidity of, or default or termination under, any of our leases may interfere with our ability to use and operate all or a portion of certain of our facilities, which may have an adverse impact on our operations and results.\nThe investment in existing and new locations may not achieve our expected returns.\nThe locations of our Supply Chain Network facilities and existing stores, planned store openings and relocations are assessed based upon desirability, demographics and retail environment. In particular, we are expanding our market strategy, where we leverage and connect our digital and physical assets within discrete geographic markets to seamlessly serve our customers within those markets and create synergies between our digital assets, Supply Chain Network and stores. Additionally, we must equip our locations with the proper processes, technology and tools for timely and accurate fulfillment and inventory replenishment. This involves certain risks, including properly balancing our capital investments between fulfillment capabilities, technology, digital channels, new stores, relocations and remodels, assessing the suitability of locations, in new domestic and international markets, and constructing, furnishing and supplying a facility or store in a timely and cost-effective manner, which may be affected by the actions of third parties, including but not limited to private entities and local, state or federal regulatory agencies.\nCustomers\u2019 expectations regarding speed of delivery are evolving. If we do not effectively integrate our digital and physical assets as part of our market strategy, or select locations to optimize our market strategy, we could incur significantly higher costs and shipping times that do not meet customer expectations, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business. Particularly in light of the changing trends between digital and brick-and-mortar shopping channels, sales through our digital channels or at our stores may not meet projections, which could adversely affect our return on investment. If we do not properly allocate capital expenditures between locations, timely complete construction projects associated with Supply Chain Network facilities and new, relocated and remodeled stores, or properly maintain any of our properties, customer expectations may not be met, we may lose sales and may incur additional expenses.\nECONOMIC AND EXTERNAL MARKET RISKS\nOur revenues and operating results are affected by the seasonal nature of our business and cyclical trends in consumer spending.\nOur business, like that of other retailers, is subject to seasonal fluctuations and cyclical trends in consumer spending. Our sales are typically higher in our second quarter, which historically included the Anniversary Sale, and the holidays in the fourth quarter. As a result of COVID-19, the Anniversary Sale was moved to August in 2020, which fell entirely in our third fiscal quarter. To provide shareholders a better understanding of management\u2019s expectations surrounding results, we provide financial outlook on our expected operating and financial results for future periods comprised of forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Any factor that negatively impacts these selling seasons could have an adverse and disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire year.\nAdditionally, factors such as results differing from guidance, changes in sales and operating income in the peak seasons, changes in our market valuations, performance results for the general retail industry, announcements by us or our industry peers or changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations may cause volatility in the price of our common stock and our shareholder returns.\nA downturn in economic conditions, currency fluctuations, inflation, increased unemployment and bankruptcy rates and other external market factors has had and could have a significant adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nDuring economic downturns, including those resulting from the impacts of COVID-19, fewer customers may shop on our websites and in our stores, particularly for our high quality items, as these purchases may be seen as discretionary, and those who do shop may limit the amount of their purchases. This reduced demand may lead to lower sales, higher markdowns and an overly promotional environment or increased marketing and promotional spending.\nOur stores located in shopping centers and malls have been and may be adversely affected by declines in consumer traffic at shopping centers and malls.\nThe majority of our stores are located within shopping centers and malls and may benefit from the abilities that we and other anchor tenants have to generate consumer traffic. A substantial decline in shopping center traffic, the development of new shopping centers and malls, the lack of availability of favorable locations within existing or new shopping centers and malls, the success of individual shopping centers and malls and the success of other anchor tenants have negatively impacted and may impact our ability in the future to maintain or grow our business, as well as our ability to open new stores, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe results from our credit card operations could be adversely affected by changes in market conditions or laws.\nRevenues earned under our program agreement with TD are indirectly subject to economic and market conditions that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, interest rates, consumer credit availability, demand for credit, consumer debt levels, payment patterns, delinquency rates, frequency of fee waivers, frequency or volume of governmental stimulus, personal bankruptcy rates, employment trends, laws and other factors. Additionally, changes in net sales partially translate to program agreement revenues. Changes in economic, market or regulatory conditions or customer behavior, or changes in our mix of sales and program agreement revenues, could impact our revenues and profitability.\nOur business and operations could be materially and adversely affected by severe weather patterns, climate change, natural disasters, widespread pandemics, epidemics, civil unrest and other natural or man-made economic, political or environmental disruptions.\nDisruptions, and government responses to any disruption, could cause, among other things, a decrease in consumer spending that would negatively impact our sales, declines in traffic in urban centers, staffing shortages in our Supply Chain Network facilities, stores or corporate offices, interruptions in the flow of merchandise to our stores, disruptions in the operations of our merchandise vendors or property developers, increased costs and a negative impact on our reputation and long-term growth plans, and may vary based on the length and severity of the disruption. We have a significant amount of our total sales, stores and square footage on the west coast of the United States, particularly in California, where we have experienced earthquakes, wildfires and power outages and shortages that increase our exposure to any market-disrupting conditions in this region.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\nWe are subject to certain laws, litigation, regulatory matters and ethical standards, and compliance or our failure to comply with or adequately address developments as they arise could adversely affect our reputation and operations.\nOur policies, procedures and practices and the technology we implement are intended to comply with applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws, tariffs, rules and regulations, including those imposed by federal, state and local jurisdictions, the SEC, consumer protection and other regulatory agencies, the marketplace, and foreign countries, as well as responsible business, social and environmental practices, all of which may change from time to time. Compliance with these requirements and/or changes to them may cause our business to be adversely impacted, or even limit or restrict the activities of our business. In addition, if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or implement responsible business, social, environmental and supply chain practices, we could be subject to damage to our reputation, class action lawsuits, regulatory investigations, legal and settlement costs, charges and payments, civil and criminal liability, increased cost of regulatory compliance, losing our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, restatements of our financial statements, disruption of our business and loss of customers. New and emerging privacy and data protection laws may increase compliance expenses and limit business opportunities and strategic initiatives, including customer engagement. Any required changes to our employment practices could result in the loss of employees, reduced sales, increased employment costs, low employee morale and harm to our business and results of operations. In addition, political and economic factors could lead to unfavorable changes in federal, state and foreign tax laws, which may affect our tax assets or liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations. We are also regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nCompliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting through documenting, testing, monitoring and enhancement of internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to implement or maintain adequate internal controls, we may not produce reliable financial reports or fail to prevent or detect financial fraud, which may adversely affect our financial position, investor confidence or our stock price.\nChanges to accounting rules and regulations could affect our financial results or financial condition.\nAccounting principles and related pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide variety of accounting matters that are relevant to our business, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, inventory valuation, long-lived asset recoverability and income taxes, are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules and regulations, changes in our interpretation or our misapplication of the rules or regulations, changes in accounting policies, changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could adversely affect our financial performance or financial position.", "PERMNO": 57817, "SIC": 5651, "TIC": "JWN"}
