RISK FACTORS.\nRisks Related to our Business\nCommercial real estate loans and commercial business loans have a higher risk of loss than residential mortgage loans and consumer loans.\nAt December 31, 2014, $148.3 million, or 40.2%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate and commercial business loans, a decrease of $313,000, or 0.2%, from $148.6 million, or 40.1%, at December 31, 2013. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans have a higher risk of default and loss than owner-occupied single-family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the borrower. Such loans also typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers than single-family residential loans. Also, many of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a residential mortgage loan.\nOur nonperforming assets expose us to increased risk of loss, which may negatively affect our earnings.\nDespite the decrease in our nonperforming assets of $9.8 million, or 64.3%, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we still had nonperforming assets of $5.4 million, or 1.1% of total assets at December 31, 2014. Our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on non-accrual loans or on real estate owned. We must reserve for probable losses, which are established through a current period charge to income in the provision for loan losses, and from time to time, write down the value of properties in our other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values. Additionally, there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance related to our other real estate owned. Further, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract us from the overall supervision of operations and other income-producing activities of Naugatuck Valley Savings and Loan. Finally, if our estimate of the allowance for loan losses is inadequate, we will have to increase the allowance accordingly. At December 31, 2014, our allowance for loan losses amounted to $6.0 million, or 1.6% of total loans outstanding and 118.0% of nonperforming loans.\nThe current economic conditions pose significant challenges that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends to a large degree on the general economic conditions in the Greater Naugatuck Valley region of Connecticut. Our market may experience a significant downturn in which we would see falling home prices, rising foreclosures and an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies. Although economic conditions have slightly improved, if economic conditions in our market area do not continue to improve or we experience another downturn, we could experience reduced demand for our products and services, increased problem assets and foreclosures and increased loan losses, each of which could further adversely affect our business.\nWe could experience further adverse consequences in the event of another economic downturn in our market due to our exposure to commercial loans across various lines of business. Another economic downturn could adversely affect collateral values or cash flows of the borrowing businesses, and as a result our primary source of repayment could be insufficient to service the debt. Another adverse consequence in the event of another economic downturn in our market could be the loss of collateral value on commercial and real estate loans that are secured by real estate located in our market area. If real estate values in our market remain below their pre-recession levels or decline again the collateral for many of our loans would provide less security. As a result, we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans because our ability to fully recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral would be diminished.\nFuture economic conditions in our market will depend on factors outside of our control such as political and market conditions, broad trends in industry and finance, legislative and regulatory changes, changes in government, military and fiscal policies and inflation.\nOur strategy of controlling commercial loan growth may have a negative effect on our earnings.\nAt December 31, 2014, our construction loan portfolio, commercial real estate portfolio and commercial business loan portfolio amounted to 5.6%, 200.6% and 42.2% respectively, of our total regulatory capital (Tier 1 capital plus ALLL) at that date. These percentages are within the limits of the loan concentration policy that we have established for these types of higher risk loans. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Lending Activities - General\u201d for further information regarding the policy limits. We intend to maintain our construction loan portfolio. However, we intend to grow our commercial real estate loan and commercial business loan portfolios, as a percentage of total regulatory capital. Our regulators may instruct or advise us to reduce these concentration levels if they deem it warranted. Commercial loans generally have higher yields than residential mortgage loans because they are considered to have a higher risk of loss. Our controlled growth strategy, or any change in strategy that makes it more stringent, may have a negative effect on our earnings.\nThe nature of our commercial and construction loan portfolio may expose us to increased lending risks.\nOur recently originated commercial real estate and commercial business loans are unseasoned. Our limited experience with these loans does not provide us with a significant payment history pattern with which to judge future collectability. As a result, it may be difficult to predict the future performance of this part of our loan portfolio. These loans may have delinquency or charge-off levels above our expectations, which could negatively affect our future performance. Further, these types of loans generally have larger balances and involve a greater risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Accordingly, if we make any errors in judgment in the collectability of our commercial or construction loans, any resulting charge-offs may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred historically with our residential mortgage loan or consumer loan portfolios.\nHigher loan losses could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, which may negatively impact our earnings.\nWhen we loan money we incur the risk that our borrowers will not repay their loans. We reserve for loan losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. We might underestimate the loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio and have loan losses in excess of the amount reserved. We might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions. For example, in a rising interest rate environment, borrowers with adjustable-rate loans could see their payments increase. There may be a significant increase in the number of borrowers who are unable or unwilling to repay their loans, resulting in our charging off more loans and increasing our allowance. In addition, when real estate values decline, the potential severity of loss on a real estate-secured loan can increase significantly, especially in the case of loans with high combined loan-to-value ratios. The recent decline in the national economy and the local economies of the areas in which our loans are concentrated could result in an increase in loan delinquencies, foreclosures or repossessions resulting in increased charge-off amounts and the need for additional loan loss provisions in future periods. In addition, our determination as to the amount of our allowance for loan losses is subject to review by our primary regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as part of its examination process, which may result in the establishment of an additional allowance based upon the judgment of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency after a review of the information available at the time of its examination. Our allowance for loan losses amounted to 1.6% of total loans outstanding and 118.0% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2014. Our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2014, may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would negatively affect earnings.\nOur emphasis on residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans exposes us to a risk of loss due to a decline in property values.\nAt December 31, 2014, $180.7 million, or 48.9%, of our loan portfolio consisted of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, $28.7 million, or 7.8%, of our loan portfolio consisted of home equity loans and $122.5 million, or 33.2% of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans. We originate home equity lines of credit with maximum combined loan-to-value ratios of up to 75%. Declines in the housing market and the increase in vacancy rates in the commercial real estate market during the past five years resulted in declines in real estate values in our market area. Despite the recent stabilization of these values, future declines in real estate values could cause some of our mortgage, home equity and commercial real estate loans to be inadequately collateralized which would expose us to a greater risk of loss in the event that we seek to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral.\nConcentration of loans in our primary market area may increase risk.\nOur success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in the State of Connecticut, as nearly all of our loans are to customers in this market, particularly our local greater Naugatuck Valley market area. Accordingly, any weakness in the economy in Connecticut could have a significant impact on the ability of our borrowers to repay loans. As such, a decline in real estate valuations in this market would lower the value of the collateral securing those loans. In addition, a significant weakening in general economic conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, or other factors beyond our control could negatively affect our financial results.\nIncome from secondary mortgage market operations is volatile, and we may incur losses or charges with respect to our secondary mortgage market operations which would negatively affect our earnings.\nWe generally sell in the secondary market the fixed-rate residential mortgage loans that we originate, earning non-interest income in the form of gains on sale. When interest rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans tends to fall and may reduce the number of loans available for sale. When interest rates fall, the demand for fixed-rate mortgage loans also tends to fall and may reduce the number of loans available for sale. In addition to interest rate levels, weak or deteriorating economic conditions also tend to reduce loan demand. Although we sell loans in the secondary market without recourse, we are required to give customary representations and warranties to the buyers. If we breach those representations and warranties, the buyers can require us to repurchase the loans and we may incur a loss on the repurchase.\nNaugatuck Valley Savings is required to comply with the terms of the formal written agreement entered into with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and lack of compliance could result in monetary penalties and/or additional regulatory actions.\nNaugatuck Valley Savings entered into a formal written agreement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on January 17, 2012. See \u201cBusiness - General - Formal Regulatory Agreement\u201d for further information. The formal written agreement and each of its provisions will remain in effect unless and until the provisions are amended in writing by mutual consent of Naugatuck Valley Savings and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or accepted, waived, or terminated in writing by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.\nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, also imposed IMCRs on the Bank effective June 4, 2013. The IMCRs require the Bank to maintain a Tier 1 leverage capital to adjusted total assets ratio of at least 9.00% and a total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 13.00%. Before the establishment of the IMCRs, the Bank had been operating under these capital parameters by self-imposing these capital levels as part of the capital plan the Bank was required to implement under the terms of the previously disclosed January 2012 Formal Agreement between the Bank and the OCC.\nIf we fail to comply with the formal written agreement or meet the IMCRs, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may pursue the assessment of civil money penalties against Naugatuck Valley Savings and its officers and directors and may seek to enforce the terms of the formal written agreement through court proceedings.\nNew capital rules generally require insured depository institutions and their holding companies to hold more capital. The impact of the new rules on our financial condition and operations is uncertain but could be materially adverse.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve and the OCC adopted a final rule for the Basel III capital framework. These rules substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us. The rules phase in over time beginning in 2015 and will become fully effective in 2019. Beginning in 2015, our minimum capital requirements will be: (i) a common Tier 1 equity ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital (common Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) of 6% (up from 4%); and (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (the current requirement). Our leverage ratio requirement will remain at the 4% level now required. Beginning in 2016, a capital conservation buffer will phase in over three years, ultimately resulting in a requirement of 2.5% on top of the common Tier 1, Tier 1 and total capital requirements, resulting in a required common Tier 1 equity ratio of 7%, a Tier 1 ratio of 8.5%, and a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Failure to satisfy any of these three capital requirements will result in limits on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. Savings and loan holding companies that have total consolidated assets of less than $500 million and meet certain other requirements, such as Naugatuck Valley Financial, are exempt from the Federal Reserve\u2019s regulatory capital requirements. The Federal Reserve has proposed increasing the asset threshold for this exemption to $1 billion.\nThe Dodd - Frank Act, among other things, created a new regulatory agency, tightened capital standards and will continue to result in new laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, has significantly changed the Bank regulatory structure and has affected the lending, deposit, investment and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many months or years. However, it is expected that the legislation and implementing regulations may materially increase our operating and compliance costs. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Office of Thrift Supervision, which previously regulated Naugatuck Valley Savings, was merged into the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which until then only regulated national banks. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, savings and loan holding companies, including Naugatuck Valley Financial, are now regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new federal agency, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) to administer consumer protection and fair lending laws, a function that was formerly performed by the depository institution regulators. The federal preemption of state laws previously accorded federally chartered depository institutions has been reduced, and State Attorneys General now have greater authority to bring a suit against a federally chartered institution, such as Naugatuck Valley Savings, for violations of certain state and federal consumer protection laws. The Dodd-Frank Act also will impose consolidated capital requirements on savings and loan holding companies by July 2015, which will limit our ability to borrow at the holding company level and invest the proceeds from such borrowings as capital in Naugatuck Valley Savings that could be leveraged to support additional growth. The Dodd-Frank Act contains various other provisions designed to enhance the regulation of depository institutions and prevent the recurrence of a financial crisis such as occurred in 2008-2009. The full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business and operations will not be known for years until regulations implementing the statute are written and adopted. The Dodd-Frank Act may have a material impact on our operations, particularly through increased regulatory burden and compliance costs.\nIn addition to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal regulatory agencies have taken stronger supervisory actions against financial institutions that have experienced increased loan losses and other weaknesses as a result of the recent economic crisis. The actions include the entering into of written agreements and cease and desist orders that place certain limitations on their operations. Federal bank regulators recently have also been using with more frequency their ability to impose individual minimal capital requirements on banks, which requirements may be higher than those imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act or which would otherwise qualify the Bank as being \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under the FDIC\u2019s prompt corrective action regulations. Given the Bank\u2019s formal agreement with the OCC and our higher individual capital requirements, such action has, and will continue to have, a negative impact on the Company\u2019s ability to execute its business plans, as well as the ability to grow, pay dividends or engage in mergers and acquisitions and may result in restrictions in the Company\u2019s future operations.\nChanges in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and earnings.\nOur net interest income is the interest we earn on loans and investments less the interest we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Our net interest spread is the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and our other sources of funding. Changes in interest rates-up or down-could adversely affect our net interest spread and, as a result, our net interest income and net interest margin. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or contract. Our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets, so they may adjust faster in response to changes in interest rates. As a result, when interest rates rise, our funding costs may rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets, causing our net interest margin to contract. This contraction could be more severe following a prolonged period of lower interest rates, as a larger proportion of our fixed rate residential loan portfolio will have been originated at those lower rates and borrowers may be more reluctant or unable to sell their homes in a higher interest rate environment. Changes in the slope of the \u201cyield curve\u201d -or the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates-could also reduce our net interest margin. Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-term rates. Because our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets, when the yield curve flattens or even inverts, we could experience pressure on our net interest margin as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets.\nIf we conclude that the decline in value of any of our investment securities is other-than-temporary, we are required to write down the value of that security.\nCompanies are required to record other-than-temporary impairment if they have the intent to sell, or will more likely than not be required to sell, an impaired debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. In addition, companies are required to record other-than-temporary impairment for the amount of credit losses, regardless of the intent or requirement to sell. We evaluate investments that have a fair value less than book value for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. Changes in the expected cash flows, credit enhancement levels or credit ratings of investment securities and/or prolonged price declines may result in our concluding in future periods that the impairment of these securities is other-than-temporary, which would require a charge to earnings to write down the value of these securities. Any charges for other-than-temporary impairment would not impact cash flow, tangible capital or liquidity.\nStrong competition within our market area could reduce our profits and slow growth.\nWe face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. This competition has made it more difficult for us to make new loans and at times has forced us to offer higher deposit rates. Price competition for loans and deposits might result in us earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits, which would reduce net interest income. Competition also makes it more difficult to grow loans and deposits. As of June 30, 2014, which is the most recent date for which information is available, we held less than 2% of the deposits in each of the counties in which our offices are located. Several of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market area.\nOur size makes it more difficult for us to compete.\nOur asset size makes it more difficult to compete with other financial institutions which are generally larger and can more easily afford to invest in the marketing and technologies needed to attract and retain customers. Because our principal source of income is the net interest income we earn on our loans and investments after deducting interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds, our ability to generate the revenues needed to cover our expenses and finance such investments is limited by the size of our loan and investment portfolios. Accordingly, we are not always able to offer new products and services as quickly as our competitors. Our lower earnings also make it more difficult to offer competitive salaries and benefits. Finally, as a smaller institution, we are disproportionately affected by the continually increasing costs of compliance with new banking and other regulations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, our primary federal regulator, and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as insurer of our deposits. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of Naugatuck Valley Savings rather than for holders of our common stock. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers, and systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe Bank\u2019s business is highly dependent on the ability to process, record and monitor, on a continuous basis, a large number of transactions. Integral to the Bank\u2019s performance is the continued efficiency of internal processes, systems, relationships with third parties, and employees in day-to-day operations. With regard to the physical infrastructure and systems that support operations, the Bank has taken measures to implement backup systems and other safeguards. The ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant and widespread disruption to the infrastructure or systems. Financial, accounting, data processing, backup or other operating systems may fail to operate properly as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond the Bank\u2019s control and adversely affect the ability to process transactions or provide services. The Bank continuously updates these systems to support operations. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years because of proliferation of new technologies, use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and increased sophistication of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties. The Bank\u2019s operations rely on secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in computer systems and networks. The banking business relies on digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, and networks to conduct operations. In addition, to access products and services, customers may use personal smartphones, PCs and other computing devices, tablet PCs and other mobile devices that are beyond the Bank\u2019s control systems. Technologies, systems, networks and customers\u2019 devices could be subject to the target of cyber attacks, computer viruses, malicious code, phishing attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of the Bank\u2019s or customers\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt the Bank\u2019s customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations.\nThe Bank has not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches, however there can be no assurance that such losses will not occur in the future. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of controls, processes and practices designed to protect systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority. As cyber threats continue to evolve, the Bank may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nIn addition, the Bank also faces risk of operational failure, termination or capacity constraints for any third party that provides business or facilitates business activities. Any such failure, termination or constraint could adversely affect the Bank\u2019s ability to effect transactions, service clients, manage exposure to risk or expand business, and could have an adverse impact on liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe Federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the \"PATRIOT Act\") and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. Federal and state bank regulators also have begun to focus on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nWe are subject to a variety of operational risks, environmental, legal and compliance risks, and the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and keep customers and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Actual or alleged conduct by the Bank can also result in negative public opinion about our other businesses.\nIf personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information of customers in our possession were to be misappropriated, mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, erroneously providing such information to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or the interception or inappropriate acquisition of such information by third parties.\nBecause the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. Our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions and our large transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. We also may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages, or natural disasters, disease pandemics or other damage to property or physical assets) which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. We are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as we are) and to the risk that our (or our vendors\u2019) business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. The occurrence of any of these risks could result in our diminished ability to operate our business (for example, by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect), as well as potential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, perhaps materially.", "PERMNO": 90416, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "NVSL"}
