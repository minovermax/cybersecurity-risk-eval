{"cik": "1275283", "company": "REYNOLDS AMERICAN INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRAI and its subsidiaries operate with certain known risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, cash flows and financial position. The risks below are not the only ones that could impact RAI and its subsidiaries. Additional risks not currently known or currently considered immaterial also could affect RAI\u2019s business. You should carefully consider the following risk factors in connection with other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other documents filed with the SEC.\nAdverse litigation outcomes could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI. Additionally, RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries could be subject to substantial liabilities and bonding difficulties from litigation related to cigarette products or other products, which could also have an adverse effect on their results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nReynolds Defendants have been named in a number of tobacco-related legal actions, proceedings or claims. The claimants seek recovery on a variety of legal theories, including negligence, strict liability in tort, design defect, failure to warn, fraud, misrepresentation, deceptive and unfair trade practices, conspiracy, medical monitoring, and violations of state and federal antitrust and racketeering laws. Various forms of relief are sought, including compensatory damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, and, where available, punitive damages in amounts ranging in some cases into the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars.\nThe tobacco-related legal actions range from individual lawsuits to class-actions and other aggregate claim lawsuits. In Engle v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., the Florida Supreme Court issued a ruling that, while determining that the case could not proceed further as a class action, permitted members of the Engle class to file individual claims, including claims for punitive damages, through January 11, 2008. The decision preserved several of the Engle jury findings for use in adjudicating these subsequent individual actions, which are now known as Engle Progeny cases. As of December 31, 2016, RJR Tobacco had been served in 2,822 pending Engle Progeny cases filed on behalf of approximately 3,645 individual plaintiffs. Many of these cases are in active discovery or nearing trial. In all Engle Progeny cases tried to date, a central issue has been the proper use of the preserved Engle findings. RJR Tobacco has argued that use of the Engle findings to establish individual elements of claims (such as defect, negligence and concealment) is a violation of federal due process. In 2013, both the Florida Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit rejected that argument.\nThe Engle Progeny cases have resulted in increased litigation and trial activity, including an increased number of adverse verdicts, and increased expenses. Through December 31, 2016, RJR Tobacco or Lorillard Tobacco cumulatively paid $297.9 million in compensatory and punitive damages and $107.7 million for attorneys\u2019 and statutory interest, for a total of $405.6 million, in these cases. In addition, outstanding jury verdicts in favor of the Engle Progeny plaintiffs had been entered against RJR Tobacco or Lorillard Tobacco in the amount of $212.2 million in compensatory damages (as adjusted) and in the amount of $227.3 million in punitive damages, for a total of $439.5 million. All of these verdicts are in various stages in the appellate process and have been bonded as required by Florida law under the $200 million bond cap passed by the Florida legislature in 2009. Bills are pending in the Florida legislature that would repeal the existing $200 million bond cap. Such a repeal, depending upon the amount of any adverse judgment, could increase the amount RJR Tobacco would be required to bond. Although RJR Tobacco cannot currently predict when or how much it may be required to bond and pay, RJR Tobacco will likely be required to bond and pay additional judgments as the litigation proceeds. For a more complete description of this litigation, see \u201c- Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry - Engle and Engle Progeny Cases\u201d in Item 8, note 13 to consolidated financial statements.\nClass-action suits have been filed in a number of states against individual cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco, and their parents, including RAI, alleging that the use of the terms \u201clights\u201d and \u201cultra-lights\u201d constitutes unfair and deceptive trade practices. In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that neither the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act nor the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s regulation of \u201ctar\u201d and nicotine disclosures preempts (or bars) such claims. This ruling limits certain defenses available to RJR Tobacco and other cigarette manufacturers and has led to the filing of additional lawsuits. In addition, several class actions have been filed against SFNTC and RAI asserting that use of the terms \u201cnatural\u201d, \u201cadditive-free\u201d and \u201corganic\u201d in the product labeling and advertising for SFNTC\u2019s NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT cigarette brand violates state disclosure, and deceptive and unfair trade practice, statutes. In addition, RJR Tobacco tendered to JTI the defense of the health-care cost reimbursement actions that Canadian provinces filed against RJR Tobacco and one of its affiliates, and RJR Tobacco also requested indemnification. JTI has accepted the defense of these cases, subject to full reservation of rights. In the event RJR Tobacco, SFNTC or their affiliates and indemnitees, or JTI lose one or more of the pending class-action or health-care reimbursement suits, RJR Tobacco, SFNTC or their affiliates and indemnitees could face, depending upon the amount of any damages ordered, difficulties in their ability to pay the judgment or obtain any bond required to stay execution of the judgment. For a more complete description of class-action litigation, see \u201c- Class-Action Suits\u201d in Item 8, note 13 to consolidated financial statements.\nIn 1999, the U.S. Department of Justice bought an action against RJR Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, B&W, and other tobacco companies pursuant to the civil provisions of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, referred to as RICO. The government sought, among other remedies, disgorgement of profits in an amount of approximately $280 billion allegedly earned as a consequence of a RICO racketeering \u201centerprise\u201d and injunctive relief. In February 2005, an appellate court ruled that disgorgement was not an available remedy. In 2006, the trial court found certain defendants, including RJR Tobacco, liable for the RICO claims (but did not impose any direct financial penalties), enjoined the defendants from committing future racketeering acts, and ordered the defendants to issue \u201ccorrective communications\u201d on five subjects, including smoking and health and addiction. The trial court\u2019s \u201ccorrective-statements\u201d remedy is subject to continuing proceedings to determine, among other things, whether the \u201ccorrective statements\u201d will have to be displayed at retail points-of-sale. Implementation of the \u201ccorrective-statements\u201d remedy could cause RJR Tobacco to incur significant compliance costs, have an adverse effect on the sales of RJR Tobacco\u2019s products, and impact legal actions pending against Reynolds Defendants. For a more complete description of this litigation, see \u201c- Health-Care Cost Recovery Cases - U.S. Department of Justice Case\u201d in Item 8, note 13 to consolidated financial statements.\nIt is likely that legal actions, proceedings and claims arising out of the sale, distribution, manufacture, development, advertising, marketing and claimed health effects of cigarettes and other tobacco products will continue to be filed against Reynolds Defendants and other tobacco companies for the foreseeable future. Actions by the FDA may further trigger such legal actions, proceedings and claims against RAI and its subsidiaries.\nVictories by plaintiffs in highly publicized cases against RJR Tobacco and other tobacco companies regarding the health effects of smoking may stimulate further claims. A material increase in the number of pending claims could significantly increase defense costs. In addition, adverse outcomes in pending cases could have adverse effects on the ability of RJR Tobacco and its indemnitees, including B&W, to prevail in other smoking and health litigation.\nAny or all of the events described above could impose substantial monetary obligations on RAI and its operating subsidiaries and could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of these companies and RAI. For a more complete description of the above cases and other significant litigation involving RAI and its operating subsidiaries, including RJR Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco and American Snuff Co., see \u201c- Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry\u201d and \u201c- Smokeless Tobacco Litigation\u201d in Item 8, note 13 to consolidated financial statements.\nAny action by the FDA or any other governmental authority that could have the effect of banning or materially restricting the use of menthol in tobacco products could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its subsidiaries.\nAs a result of the Lorillard Merger, RAI, through its subsidiaries, acquired Lorillard\u2019s NEWPORT brand, the leading U.S. menthol cigarette brand. NEWPORT menthol cigarette styles were added to the brand portfolio of RAI\u2019s operating companies, a portfolio which includes other brands with menthol styles. RAI estimates that approximately 50% of its total net sales were attributable to menthol cigarettes for the year ended December 31, 2016. See Item 8, note 2 to consolidated financial statements.\nIn 2013, the FDA issued its preliminary scientific evaluation regarding menthol cigarettes, concluding that menthol cigarettes adversely affect initiation, addiction and cessation compared to non-menthol cigarettes. In 2013, the FDA also issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, seeking comments on various issues relating to the potential regulation of menthol cigarettes. Although it is not possible to predict whether or when the FDA will take actions, if the FDA or any other governmental authority were to adopt regulations banning or severely restricting the use of menthol in tobacco products or the sale of menthol cigarettes, those regulations could have a material adverse effect on sales of the NEWPORT brand, and the menthol styles of other brands in the portfolio of RAI\u2019s operating companies. Such an effect on sales could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its subsidiaries.\nIn addition to regulatory action affecting the use of menthol in cigarettes, the FDA could regulate tobacco products, including electronic cigarettes, in other aspects that could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its subsidiaries.\nThe FDA Tobacco Act grants the FDA broad authority over the manufacture, sale, marketing and packaging of tobacco products. FDA actions taken pursuant to the FDA Tobacco Act could result in a decrease in cigarette and smokeless tobacco product sales in the United States, including sales of RJR Tobacco\u2019s, American Snuff Co.\u2019s and SFNTC\u2019s brands, and has resulted in an increase in costs to RJR Tobacco, American Snuff Co. and SFNTC, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its subsidiaries.\nThe ability of RAI\u2019s operating companies to introduce new tobacco products, a critical component of RAI\u2019s strategy of focusing on innovation to transform the tobacco industry, could be adversely affected by FDA rules and regulations. Under the FDA Tobacco Act, for a manufacturer to launch a new tobacco product or modify an existing tobacco product after March 22, 2011, the manufacturer must obtain an order from the FDA\u2019s \u201cCenter for Tobacco Products,\u201d referred to as the CTP, allowing the new or modified product to be marketed. Similarly, a manufacturer that introduced a product between February 15, 2007, and March 22, 2011, was required to file a substantial equivalence report with the CTP demonstrating either (1) that the new or modified product had the same characteristics as a product commercially available as of February 15, 2007, referred to as a predicate product, or (2) if the new or modified product had different characteristics than the predicate product, that it did not raise different questions of public health. A product subject to such report is referred to as a provisional product. A manufacturer may continue to market a provisional product unless and until the CTP issues an order that the provisional product is not substantially equivalent, referred to as an NSE order, in which case the FDA could then require the manufacturer to remove the provisional product from the market. On September 15, 2015, the CTP issued four NSE orders to RJR Tobacco, determining that four cigarette styles were not substantially equivalent to their respective predicate products, and ordering that RJR Tobacco immediately stop all distribution, importation, sale, marketing and promotion of these provisional products. RJR Tobacco has complied with these NSE orders. Although the sales of the provisional products subject to the foregoing NSE orders are not material to RJR Tobacco, substantially all of RAI\u2019s operating companies\u2019 products currently on the market are provisional products. If the CTP were to issue NSE orders with respect to other provisional products of RAI\u2019s operating companies, such orders, if not withdrawn or invalidated, would have an adverse impact on the sales of the products subject to the orders, and could have an adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its subsidiaries.\nOn May 10, 2016, the FDA issued a final regulation deeming e-cigarettes and certain other tobacco products to be subject to the FDA\u2019s regulatory authority under the FDA Tobacco Act. As a result, such newly \u201cdeemed\u201d tobacco products will be subject to many of the same requirements of the FDA Tobacco Act that currently apply to cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. Under the final regulation, any newly \u201cdeemed\u201d tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, that were not on the market as of February 15, 2007, will be considered a new tobacco product subject to premarket review by the FDA. Neither RJR Vapor\u2019s VUSE e-cigarette, nor virtually any other e-cigarette, was on the market as of such date. As a result, e-cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Vapor, will not be able to utilize the substantial equivalence pathway for clearing these products, but instead will have to file premarket tobacco product applications. These applications must be filed by August 8, 2018, for e-cigarette products in the market as of August 8, 2016. A manufacturer that files a premarket application for such a product may continue to market the product for a certain period of time pending the FDA\u2019s review of the application. For products that were not in the market by August 8, 2016, manufacturers must file and await clearance of such premarket applications before placing such products into commerce.\nFor the FDA to clear a premarket tobacco product application covering an e-cigarette, the applicant must show that the marketing of the e-cigarette would be appropriate for the protection of the public health. At present, there is substantial uncertainty over how the FDA will interpret that standard when determining whether to clear an e-cigarette premarket tobacco application. If RJR Vapor is unable to obtain FDA clearance, or obtains FDA clearance on a delayed basis, of premarket applications for VUSE and other e-cigarette products, then there could be an adverse effect on RJR Vapor\u2019s business which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows, and financial position of RAI and its subsidiaries, including RJR Vapor.\nOn August 27, 2015, the FDA sent a warning letter to SFNTC claiming that SFNTC\u2019s use of the terms \u201cNatural\u201d and \u201cAdditive Free\u201d in the product labeling and advertising for Natural American Spirit cigarettes violates the Modified Risk Tobacco Products provision of the FDA Tobacco Act. Following discussions between the parties, on January 23, 2017, the FDA and SFNTC reached an agreement whereby, among other things, SFNTC committed to phasing out use of the terms \u201cNatural\u201d and \u201cAdditive Free\u201d from product labeling and advertising for Natural American Spirit cigarettes on an established timeframe. The agreement also specifies that SFNTC may continue to use the term \u201cNatural\u201d in the Natural American Spirit brand name and trademarks. SFNTC\u2019s scheduled deletion of the terms \u201cNatural\u201d and \u201cAdditive Free\u201d from the labeling and advertising of its Natural American Spirit cigarettes could have an adverse effect on the sale of such cigarettes and, as a result, on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of SFNTC and RAI.\nFurther, the FDA has the authority to require the reduction of nicotine levels under the FDA Tobacco Act and also may require reduction or elimination of other constituents. For instance, the FDA has proposed a rule that, if adopted, would require the reduction, over a three-year period, of the levels of N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) contained in smokeless tobacco products. The adoption of this proposed rule is currently suspended by virtue of a federal regulatory freeze imposed by the U.S. President. It is not known whether or when this proposed rule will be adopted, and, if adopted, whether the final rule will be the same as or similar to the proposed rule. If the proposed rule is adopted, however, in its current form (or in a form substantially similar to its current form), management expects that compliance or the inability to comply could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of American Snuff and RAI.\nFor a detailed description of the FDA Tobacco Act, see \u201c- Governmental Activity\u201d in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7.\nSignificant monetary obligations imposed under the State Settlement Agreements into perpetuity, may have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and RJR Tobacco. Certain amounts incurred pursuant to the MSA have been disputed by RJR Tobacco and are subject to future arbitration proceedings that may result in rulings that reduce or eliminate the recovery of disputed amounts by RJR Tobacco.\nIn 1998, RJR Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers entered into the MSA with attorneys general representing most U.S. states, territories and possessions. The State Settlement Agreements, of which the MSA is the most wide-reaching, impose a perpetual stream of future payment obligations on RJR Tobacco and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, and place significant restrictions on their ability to market and sell tobacco products in the future. They have materially adversely affected RJR Tobacco\u2019s shipment volumes, and they may have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and RJR Tobacco in future periods.\nRJR Tobacco and Lorillard Tobacco disputed a total of $5.6 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, in potential MSA non-participating manufacturer adjustment, referred to as the NPM Adjustment, claims for the years 2003 through 2014. A nationwide arbitration, referred to as the Arbitration Panel, was initiated with respect to the 2003 NPM Adjustment claim.\nDuring the arbitration of the 2003 NPM Adjustment claim, RJR Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, SFNTC and certain other participating manufacturers, referred to as the PMs, and certain \u201csignatory\u201d states entered into a binding Term Sheet that set forth terms to resolve NPM Adjustment claims for 2003 through 2012. The Term Sheet also set forth a restructured NPM Adjustment process to be applied to future volume years, starting with the 2013 volume year. Under the settlement, RJR Tobacco is to receive more than $1.1 billion worth of credits, a portion of which has been applied to its MSA payments in 2014, 2015 and 2016, with the remainder to be applied against its 2017 and 2018 MSA payments. In addition, RJR Tobacco, SFNTC and certain other participating manufacturers entered into a settlement agreement with the state of New York that resolved NPM Adjustment claims for 2004 through 2014 and put in place a new method to determine future adjustment from 2015 forward as to New York.\nIn September 2013, the Arbitration Panel issued final awards on the 2003 NPM Adjustment claim. Unfavorable rulings against two states remain unresolved and are subject to lawsuits in those respective state courts. After the above NPM Adjustment settlements, $1.9 billion and $400 million of the 2004 through 2014 NPM Adjustment remain in dispute for RJR Tobacco and Lorillard Tobacco,\nrespectively. The arbitration proceeding of the 2004 NPM Adjustment claim is underway. RJR Tobacco\u2019s and Lorillard Tobacco\u2019s remaining claim with respect to 2004 is approximately $251 million.\nDue to the uncertainty over the final resolutions of the NPM Adjustment asserted by RJR Tobacco and Lorillard Tobacco, no assurances can be made related to the amounts, if any, that will be realized or any amounts (including interest) that will be owed.\nFor a more complete description of the State Settlement Agreements and the Arbitration Panel\u2019s awards, see \u201c- Health-Care Cost Recovery Cases - State Settlement Agreements\u201d and \u201c- Health-Care Cost Recovery Cases - State Settlement Agreements - Enforcement and Validity; Adjustments\u201d in Item 8, note 13 to consolidated financial statements.\nRAI, through its subsidiaries, is dependent on the U.S. cigarette market, which is expected to continue to decline. In addition, RAI is dependent on premium and super-premium cigarette brands. The continued decline in U.S. cigarette consumption, or the transition of consumers away from premium cigarette brands, could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI.\nRAI\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 U.S. combustible cigarette brands include, among others, NEWPORT, CAMEL, PALL MALL and NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT. RAI\u2019s sales in the United States attributable to combustible cigarettes represented approximately 89% of RAI\u2019s 2016 net sales. U.S. cigarette consumption has declined since 1981 for a variety of reasons including, for example, price increases, restrictions on advertising and promotions, smoking prevention campaigns, increases in regulation and excise taxes, health concerns, a decline in the social acceptability of smoking, governmental and private restrictions on the locations where smoking is permitted, increased pressure from anti-tobacco groups, and migration to smoke-free products. U.S. consumption is expected to continue to decline. MSAi reported that, on a year-over-year basis, U.S. cigarette shipments declined 2.4% in 2016, 0.1% in 2015 and 3.2% in 2014.\nThe sale of the international rights to the NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT brand name to JTI Holding in early 2016 increased the reliance of RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries on the U.S. cigarette market. In addition, pursuant to that transaction, RAI has agreed not to, and agreed to cause its controlled affiliates not to, engage in the business of producing, selling, distributing and developing natural, organic and additive-free combustible tobacco cigarettes and roll-your-own or make-your-own tobacco products outside of the United States for a period of five years after the closing.\nIn addition, RAI\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 brands are subject to consumer price sensitivities, with certain brands subject to greater price sensitivities than others or competitors\u2019 brands. Some consumers may switch to a lower-priced brand than the brands offered by RAI\u2019s subsidiaries. As a result of the acquisition of Lorillard\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 brands, which principally consist of NEWPORT, RAI\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 concentration of premium and super-premium brands increased significantly and in 2016, accounted for approximately 73% of RAI\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 cigarette volume. As a result, RAI\u2019s subsidiaries are more susceptible to consumer price sensitivities following the Lorillard Merger. A downturn in the economy or other adverse financial or economic conditions could increase the number of consumers switching to a lower-priced brand.\nThe continued decline in U.S. cigarette consumption, or the transition of consumers away from premium cigarette brands, could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI.\nIf RJR Tobacco and RAI\u2019s other operating companies are not able to develop, produce or market new alternative products profitably, the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its operating subsidiaries could be adversely affected.\nConsumer health concerns, changes in adult tobacco consumer preferences and changes in regulations have prompted RJR Tobacco and other RAI operating companies to introduce new alternative products. Consumer acceptance of these new products, such as CAMEL Snus and e-cigarettes, may fall below expectations, in which event RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries may be unable to replace all or any significant portion of lost revenues resulting from the continuing decline in cigarette consumption generally.\nFurther, while VUSE, an RJR Vapor e-cigarette product, is currently the number one e-cigarette product sold in convenience/gas stores, sales of closed system products like VUSE continue to decline in comparison to the sale of tanks and liquid nicotine containers typically sold in vapor shops and on-line. The future success of VUSE and other RJR Vapor e-cigarette offerings, including VUSE Vibe, will depend on the ability to innovate in an evolving category of alternative tobacco products.\nIn addition, RAI\u2019s operating companies may not be able to establish or maintain relationships, on favorable commercial terms, with vendors willing to produce alternative products, or components or raw materials used in such products, resulting in additional expenditures for RAI\u2019s operating companies.\nIf RJR Tobacco and RAI\u2019s other operating companies are not able to develop, produce or market new alternative products to replace declining cigarette sales, then there could be an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its operating subsidiaries.\nCompetitive actions and pricing pressures in the marketplace could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RJR Tobacco, Santa Fe and American Snuff.\nThe tobacco industry is highly competitive. Among the major manufacturers, brands primarily compete on product quality, price, brand recognition, brand imagery and packaging. Substantial marketing support, merchandising display, discounting, promotions and other financial incentives generally are required to maintain or improve a brand\u2019s market position or introduce a new brand. Competitors may also have certain advantages, including stronger financial position and liquidity, enabling them to better withstand the effects of competition and declines in price.\nIn addition, substantial payment obligations under the State Settlement Agreements adversely affect RJR Tobacco\u2019s ability to compete with manufacturers of deep-discount cigarettes that are not subject to such substantial obligations. For a more complete description of the State Settlement Agreements, see \u201c- Health-Care Cost Recovery Cases - State Settlement Agreements\u201d in Item 8, note 13 to consolidated financial statements.\nInability to compete effectively may result in loss of market share, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its operating subsidiaries.\nIn the United States, tobacco products are subject to substantial and increasing regulation and taxation, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its operating subsidiaries.\nA wide variety of federal, state and local laws limit the advertising, sale and/or use of tobacco products. These laws have proliferated in recent years. For example, some local laws prohibit the sale of certain tobacco products. Another example is that some local laws prohibit certain types of marketing practices, such as consumer coupons. In addition, there are many local laws that prohibit the consumption of cigarettes and other tobacco products in restaurants and other public places. Private businesses also have adopted policies that prohibit or restrict, or are intended to discourage, smoking and tobacco use. These laws and regulations could result in a decline in the overall sales volume of tobacco products, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its operating subsidiaries.\nTobacco products are subject to substantial federal and state excise taxes in the United States. Certain city and county governments also impose substantial excise taxes on tobacco products sold. Over the last several years, these taxing authorities have significantly increased the magnitude of excise taxes on tobacco products. Increased excise taxes have resulted in declines in overall sales volume and shifts by consumers to less expensive brands, and additional increases could result in future sales declines. For additional information on the issues described above, see \u201c- Governmental Activity\u201d in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7.\nRAI\u2019s largest operating subsidiaries are subject to significant limitations on advertising and marketing of tobacco products, which could harm the value of their existing brands and their ability to launch new brands, and could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of these companies and RAI.\nIn the United States, television and radio advertisements of cigarettes have been prohibited since 1971, and television and radio advertisements of smokeless tobacco products have been prohibited since 1986. Under the MSA, RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries, RJR Tobacco and SFNTC, cannot use billboard advertising, cartoon characters, sponsorship of certain events, non-tobacco merchandise bearing their brand names and various other advertising and marketing techniques. The MSA also prohibits targeting of youth in advertising, promotion or marketing of tobacco products, including the smokeless tobacco products of RJR Tobacco. American Snuff Co. is not a participant in the MSA. Although these restrictions were intended to ensure that tobacco advertising was not aimed at young people, some of the restrictions also may limit the ability of RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries to communicate with adult tobacco consumers. In addition, pursuant to the FDA Tobacco Act, the FDA has reissued regulations addressing advertising and marketing restrictions that were originally promulgated in 1996. Additional restrictions under the FDA regulations, or otherwise, may be imposed or agreed to in the future. These limitations on the advertising and marketing of tobacco products inhibit RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries from promoting and maintaining the value of their existing brands and limit their ability to launch new brands, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of these companies and RAI.\nFluctuations in the availability, quality and price of raw materials and commodities, including tobacco leaf, used in the products of RAI\u2019s subsidiaries could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its operating subsidiaries.\nPossible fluctuations in the availability, quality and price of raw materials and commodities, including tobacco leaf, used in RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries\u2019 products could cause profits to decline which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its operating subsidiaries.\nRAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials. An interruption in service from any of these suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI.\nRAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries rely on a limited number of suppliers for raw materials. If a supplier fails to meet any of RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries\u2019 demands for raw materials, any such operating subsidiary may fail to operate effectively and may fail to meet shipment demand, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of such subsidiary and RAI.\nFire, violent weather conditions and other disasters that affect manufacturing and other facilities of RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries, or of their suppliers and vendors, could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its operating subsidiaries.\nA major fire, violent weather conditions or other disasters that affect manufacturing and other facilities of RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries, or of their suppliers and vendors, could have a material adverse effect on the operations of RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries. In particular, RJR Tobacco\u2019s cigarette manufacturing is conducted primarily at a single facility. Additionally, SFNTC\u2019s cigarette manufacturing is conducted at a single facility. Despite RAI\u2019s insurance coverage for some of these events, a prolonged interruption in the manufacturing operations of RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on the ability of such subsidiaries to effectively operate their businesses, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its operating subsidiaries.\nCertain of RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries may be required to write down intangible assets, including goodwill, due to impairment, thus reducing operating profit.\nIntangible assets include goodwill, trademarks and other intangibles. The determination of fair value involves considerable estimates and judgment. For goodwill, the determination of fair value of a reporting unit involves, among other things, RAI\u2019s market capitalization, and application of the income approach, which includes developing forecasts of future cash flows and determining an appropriate discount rate. If goodwill impairment is implied, the fair values of individual assets and liabilities, including unrecorded intangibles, must be determined. During the annual testing in the fourth quarter of 2016, the estimated fair value of each of RAI\u2019s reporting units was substantially in excess of its respective carrying value.\nTrademarks and other intangible assets with indefinite lives also are tested for impairment annually, in the fourth quarter. At December 31, 2016, the aggregate fair value of RAI\u2019s operating units\u2019 trademarks and other intangible assets was substantially in excess of their aggregate carrying value. However, at December 31, 2016, the individual fair values of five trademarks were less than 15% in excess of their respective carrying values. The aggregate carrying value of these five trademarks was $27.3 billion at December 31, 2016.\nThe methodology used to determine the fair value of trademarks includes assumptions with inherent uncertainty, including projected sales volumes and related projected revenues, long-term growth rates, royalty rates that a market participant might assume and judgments regarding the factors to develop an applied discount rate.\nThe carrying value of intangible assets is at risk of impairment if future projected revenues or long-term growth rates are lower than those currently projected, or if factors used in the development of a discount rate result in the application of a higher discount rate.\nGoodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets are tested more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The carrying value of these intangible assets could be impaired if a significant adverse change in the use, life, or brand strategy of the asset is determined, or if a significant adverse change in the legal and regulatory environment, business or competitive climate occurs that would adversely impact the asset.\nFor additional information, see Item 8, note 5 to consolidated financial statements.\nIncreases in pension and postretirement expense that reduce profitability, or increases in pension and postretirement contributions that are required to be made, could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI.\nRAI\u2019s profitability is affected by the costs of pension and postretirement benefits available to employees, generally those hired prior to 2004. Adverse changes in investment returns earned on pension assets, discount rates and other assumptions used to calculate pension and postretirement obligations, which in most cases are beyond RAI\u2019s control, may have an unfavorable impact on pension and postretirement expense. In addition, changes to pension legislation or changes in pension accounting may adversely affect pension and postretirement expense. As such, there can be no assurance that pension and postretirement expense will not increase in the future, and such increases may have an adverse effect on the results of operations and financial position of RAI.\nIn 2016, RAI contributed $335 million to its pension plans and $66 million to its postretirement plans. During 2017, RAI expects to contribute $111 million to its pension plans and $78 million to its postretirement plans. RAI may be required to make additional contributions beyond what is currently contemplated to fund its pension and postretirement benefit plans, and those contributions could have an adverse effect on the cash flows and financial position of RAI.\nFor additional information, see Item 8, note 16 to consolidated financial statements.\nCertain of RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries face a customer concentration risk. The loss of such a customer would result in a decline in revenue and could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI.\nRevenues from two distributors, McLane and Core-Mark, constituted approximately 28% and 14%, respectively, of RAI\u2019s consolidated revenue in 2016. The loss of these customers, or a significant decline in their purchases, could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI.\nDisruptions in information technology systems, including a security breach, or, more generally, the inability to effectively use digital technologies could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its subsidiaries.\nRAI and its subsidiaries are dependent on information technology systems to operate and manage all aspects of their businesses, including, without limitation, to comply with regulatory, legal, financial reporting and tax requirements, and to collect and store confidential information. Such confidential information may include proprietary business information, and what is often referred to as \u201cpersonally identifiable information,\u201d or certain information about individuals (such as employees and, in the case of RAI\u2019s subsidiaries, consumers). The use and handling of personally identifiable information is subject to developing regulations, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and the cost of regulatory compliance may be significant.\nRAI and its subsidiaries also rely on third party vendors to operate their information technology and to perform certain services for the companies. Certain of these vendors store, process or otherwise handle confidential information, including personally identifiable information. RAI\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 information technology systems, and the systems of their vendors, may not function as intended, and may be vulnerable to damage, interruption, or shutdown from a variety of events, such as computer system and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, user errors and catastrophic events.\nCybersecurity threats, which are constantly evolving and becoming more prevalent, also pose a risk to the security and viability of RAI\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 information technology systems, and the systems of their vendors. Security breaches could be committed by third parties intending to access, misappropriate or corrupt confidential information and personally identifiable information, or otherwise to disrupt the business of RAI and its subsidiaries. The techniques used in cybersecurity attacks change frequently, potentially delaying the detection of such an attack. Despite RAI\u2019s investments to address cybersecurity threats, it may be difficult for RAI to anticipate and implement adequate preventative measures. Any interruptions, failures or breaches of RAI\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 information technology systems, or the systems of their vendors, could result in: the loss of revenue and customers; transaction errors and processing inefficiencies; the loss or unauthorized disclosure of, or damage to, confidential and personally identifiable information and/or other assets; damage to the reputation of RAI and its subsidiaries and to the brands of those subsidiaries; litigation and regulatory enforcement actions; and increased costs. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its subsidiaries.\nCompetition in the tobacco industry is based, in part, on the effective use of digital technologies. In particular, the failure to (1) take advantage of opportunities, and respond to challenges, arising from the increasing digital influence on consumer purchasing decisions, (2) fully maximize evolving technology so as to (i) automate, or otherwise enhance the efficiencies of, business processes, (ii) support and accelerate product innovation and (iii) simplify regulatory compliance, and (3) adopt and implement effective e-\ncommerce strategies for the promotion of e-cigarettes and other vapor products, could lead to a competitive disadvantage, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its subsidiaries.\nDifficulties attracting and retaining qualified employees, officers, and professionals due to the impact of health and social issues associated with the tobacco industry could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its subsidiaries.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified employees, officers and professionals may be difficult given the health and social issues associated with the tobacco industry. If RAI and its subsidiaries are unable to recruit, retain and motivate key personnel to maintain the current businesses of these companies and support development of new products, it could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its subsidiaries.\nRAI is obligated to indemnify ITG for specified matters and to retain certain liabilities related to the divested brands and other assets.\nUnder the asset purchase agreement related to the Divestiture, RAI will indemnify ITG against losses arising from, among other things, breaches of representations and warranties, breaches of covenants, assets excluded from the transaction, excluded liabilities, certain specific tobacco liabilities, certain assumed plaintiff fees, certain employment related obligations, and liabilities in connection with certain tobacco litigation, settlement and regulatory matters. The asset purchase agreement related to the Divestiture does not cap RAI\u2019s indemnification obligations, except with respect to any indemnification arising from breaches of certain representations and warranties or pre-closing covenants. Accordingly, these indemnification obligations could be substantial and could have an adverse effect on RAI\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nSFNTC is obligated to indemnify JTI Holding for certain liabilities relating to specified pre-sale statements made by the disposed-of entities relating to NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT brand cigarettes consumed outside the United States.\nUnder the purchase agreement relating to the sale of the international rights to the NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT brand to JTI Holding, SFNTC and two other RAI subsidiaries will indemnify JTI Holding against liabilities resulting from breaches of representations, warranties, or covenants; certain pre-sale debts of the disposed-of entities; the operation of the NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT brand business in the United States; and liabilities arising from either personal injury actions commenced on or before January 13, 2019, or other actions commenced on or before January 13, 2021, where such actions are based on pre-sale statements by the disposed-of entities that NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT brand cigarettes intended to be consumed outside the United States were natural, organic, or additive free. Such purchase agreement does not cap these indemnification obligations, except with respect to breaches of representations or warranties. Accordingly, these indemnification obligations could be substantial and could have an adverse effect on RAI\u2019s and SFNTC\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nThe ability of RAI to access the debt capital markets could be impaired if the credit ratings of its debt securities fall. Borrowing costs under RAI\u2019s revolving credit facility could increase as the credit ratings of RAI\u2019s long-term debt falls.\nRAI\u2019s credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, RAI\u2019s cost of capital. As of December 31, 2016, the outstanding notes issued by RAI were rated investment grade. During 2016, Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services upgraded all of its BBB- ratings on RAI one notch, to BBB, Moody\u2019s Investor Service reaffirmed RAI\u2019s Baa3 senior unsecured debt rating and Fitch Ratings assigned a Long-Term Issuer Default Rating on RAI of BBB. If RAI\u2019s credit ratings were to fall, RAI may not be able to sell additional debt securities or borrow money in such amounts, at the times, at the lower interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available if its debt maintained its current or higher ratings. In addition, future debt security issuances or other borrowings may be subject to further negative terms, including provisions for collateral or limitations on indebtedness or more restrictive covenants, if RAI\u2019s credit ratings decline.\nRAI\u2019s credit ratings are influenced by some important factors not entirely within the control of RAI or its affiliates, such as tobacco litigation, the regulatory environment and the performance of suppliers to RAI\u2019s operating subsidiaries. Moreover, because the kinds of events and contingencies that may impair RAI\u2019s credit ratings and the ability of RAI and its affiliates to access the debt capital markets are often the same kinds of events and contingencies that could cause RAI and its affiliates to seek to raise additional capital on an urgent basis, RAI and its affiliates may not be able to issue debt securities or borrow money with acceptable terms, or at all, at the times at which they may most need additional capital.\nIn addition, the interest rate RAI pays on borrowings under its revolving credit facility is equal to an underlying interest rate plus an applicable margin, which margin is based on the ratings of RAI\u2019s senior, unsecured, long-term indebtedness. If these ratings decline, the applicable margin RAI is required to pay would increase. RAI pays a fee on commitments under its revolving credit facility based on the ratings of RAI\u2019s senior, unsecured, long-term indebtedness. As a result, although the revolving credit facility\nprovides RAI with a source of liquidity, the cost of borrowing under, and of maintaining, that facility could be at a higher rate at a time when RAI most needs to utilize that facility.\nFor more complete information on RAI\u2019s credit agreement and long-term debt, see Item 8, notes 11 and 12 to consolidated financial statements.\nAn adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI or its operating subsidiaries could cause RAI\u2019s Board to depart from or change its historical dividend policy.\nRAI\u2019s Board could, at its discretion, depart from or change its dividend policy at any time. RAI is not required to pay dividends and its shareholders do not have contractual or other legal rights to receive them. RAI\u2019s ability to pay dividends is dependent on its earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, expected cash needs, debt covenant compliance and other factors considered relevant by RAI\u2019s Board. To the extent that RAI or its operating subsidiaries experience an adverse effect on their results of operations, cash flows or financial position or such other relevant factors, as noted above, RAI\u2019s Board may decide, at its discretion, to decrease the amount of dividends, change or revoke the dividend policy or discontinue paying dividends entirely. In addition, if RAI does not pay or reduces its historical dividend rate, the market price of its common stock could decline.\nThere are a variety of risks, contingencies and other uncertainties associated with the BAT Merger that could result in the failure of the BAT Merger to be completed or, if completed, to have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI or the combined company, respectively, or on shareholders generally.\nRAI\u2019s ability to complete the BAT Merger is subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, failure to satisfy required closing conditions to the BAT Merger, including the failure to obtain necessary shareholder, regulatory or other approvals, or complete the BAT Merger in a timely manner or at all; if necessary approvals are obtained, the possibility of being subjected to conditions that could reduce the expected synergies and other benefits of the BAT Merger, result in a material delay in, or the abandonment of, the BAT Merger or otherwise have an adverse effect on RAI or the combined company; and the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the right of a party to terminate the Merger Agreement, including such a circumstance where RAI would be required to pay BAT a termination fee of $1 billion. As a result, one or more conditions to closing of the BAT Merger may not be satisfied and the BAT Merger may not be completed. Any delay in completing the BAT Merger may adversely affect the synergies and other benefits that RAI and BAT expect to achieve assuming the BAT Merger and the integration of the companies\u2019 respective businesses are completed within the expected timeframe.\nDuring the pendency of the BAT Merger, RAI and its subsidiaries will be subject to business uncertainties, certain operating restrictions and merger-related costs. Further, the Merger Agreement contains restrictions on RAI\u2019s ability to pursue other alternatives to the BAT Merger. The ability of RAI or its subsidiaries to retain customers, retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with suppliers may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the BAT Merger, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI and its operating subsidiaries. RAI\u2019s management may be distracted from ongoing business operations due to the BAT Merger. Further, RAI\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests in the BAT Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of RAI shareholders generally. These interests may cause RAI\u2019s directors and executive officers to view the BAT Merger differently and more favorably than RAI shareholders may view it.\nEven if the BAT Merger is completed, there can be no assurance that the expected benefits of the merger will occur or be fully or timely realized. Further, there can be no assurance of the value of the merger consideration that RAI shareholders will receive; the BAT ADS exchange ratio for the non-cash portion of the merger consideration is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any change in either RAI\u2019s or BAT\u2019s stock price. Following the completion of the BAT Merger, RAI\u2019s former shareholders will be subject to different rights as BAT shareholders. If the combined company is not able to successfully combine the businesses of RAI and BAT in an efficient and effective manner, the anticipated benefits and cost savings may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of common stock of the combined company may be affected adversely. The value to former RAI shareholders of such common stock may be further adversely affected post-closing, as former RAI shareholders will be subject to exchange rate risk with respect to BAT ADSs, a risk not associated with RAI common stock prior to the BAT Merger. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the BAT Merger, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of the combined company, which may adversely affect the value of its common stock following the BAT Merger. In addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized. Actual growth and cost savings, if achieved, may be lower than what the combined company expects and may take longer to achieve than anticipated. If the combined company is not able to adequately address integration challenges, the combined company may be unable to integrate successfully BAT\u2019s and RAI\u2019s operations or to realize the anticipated benefits of the integration of the two companies.\nDuring the pendency of the BAT Merger, or in the event the BAT Merger is not completed, BAT\u2019s significant beneficial equity interest in RAI could be determinative in matters submitted to a vote by RAI shareholders, resulting in RAI taking actions that RAI\u2019s other shareholders do not support. BAT and B&W also have influence over RAI by virtue of the Governance Agreement, which requires B&W\u2019s approval before RAI takes certain actions.\nBAT, through its subsidiaries, beneficially owns approximately 42% of the outstanding shares of RAI common stock. No other shareholder owns more than 10% of the outstanding shares of RAI common stock. Unless substantially all of RAI\u2019s public shareholders vote together on matters presented to RAI shareholders, BAT, through its subsidiaries, would have the power to determine the outcome of matters submitted to a shareholder vote, subject to the Governance Agreement described below.\nMoreover, in connection with the B&W business combination, RAI, B&W and BAT entered into an agreement, referred to as the Governance Agreement, relating to various aspects of RAI\u2019s corporate governance. RAI is currently subject to, and throughout the pendency of the BAT Merger will be subject to, the provisions of the Governance Agreement. Under the Governance Agreement, the approval of B&W, as a RAI shareholder, is required in connection with, among other things, the following matters:\n\u2022\nthe sale or transfer of certain RAI intellectual property associated with B&W brands having an international presence, other than in connection with a sale of RAI; and\n\u2022\nRAI\u2019s adoption of any takeover defense measures that would apply to the acquisition of equity securities of RAI by BAT or its affiliates, other than a re-adoption of the RAI rights plan in the form permitted by the Governance Agreement.\nSuch influence could result in RAI taking actions that RAI\u2019s other shareholders do not support. The Governance Agreement and amendments thereto are filed as Exhibits 10.9 to 10.12 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nUnder the Governance Agreement, B&W is entitled to nominate individuals to RAI\u2019s Board, and the approvals of the majority of those individuals is required before certain actions may be taken, even though those individuals represent less than a majority of the entire Board.\nUnder the Governance Agreement, B&W, based upon the current beneficial ownership of BAT through its subsidiaries, is entitled to nominate five directors to RAI\u2019s Board, at least three of whom are required to be independent directors and two of whom may be executive officers of BAT or any of its subsidiaries. RAI\u2019s Board currently is composed of 14 persons, including five designees of B&W, the maximum number of designees that B&W is entitled to nominate under the Governance Agreement. Matters requiring the approval of RAI\u2019s Board generally require the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present at a meeting. Under the Governance Agreement, however, the approval of a majority of B&W\u2019s designees on RAI\u2019s Board is required in connection with the following matters:\n\u2022\nany issuance of RAI equity securities in excess of 5% of its outstanding voting stock, unless at such time BAT and its subsidiaries\u2019 ownership interest in RAI is less than 32%; and\n\u2022\nany repurchase of RAI common stock, subject to a number of exceptions, unless at such time BAT and its subsidiaries\u2019 ownership interest in RAI is less than 25%.\nAs a result, B&W\u2019s designees on RAI\u2019s Board may prevent the foregoing transactions from being effected, notwithstanding a majority of the entire Board may have voted to approve such transactions. Though such transactions are nonetheless restricted by the provisions of the Merger Agreement, should the BAT Merger not be completed, the Governance Agreement restrictions will remain in place.\nUnder the RAI articles of incorporation, neither BAT nor any director of RAI who is affiliated with, or employed by, BAT is required to present a business opportunity to RAI if the business opportunity does not primarily relate to the United States. The loss of favorable business opportunities could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI.\nUnless otherwise agreed by the parties, under the RAI articles of incorporation, neither BAT or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates nor any director of RAI who is affiliated with, or employed by, BAT or its subsidiaries and affiliates, including any B&W designated director, is required to present a transaction, relationship, arrangement or other opportunity, all of which are collectively referred to as a business opportunity to RAI, RAI\u2019s Board or any RAI officer or employee if the business opportunity does not relate primarily to the United States. RAI has renounced any expectancy or interest in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any such business opportunity, and BAT and its subsidiaries and affiliates are entitled to act upon any such business opportunity and will not be liable to RAI or any RAI shareholders for taking any such action or not presenting such business opportunity to RAI. As a result, RAI may not be presented with certain favorable business opportunities that are known to BAT or a BAT affiliated director of\nRAI, and BAT may take advantage and receive the benefits of those business opportunities. Because of this provision, if the BAT Merger is not completed, the loss of favorable business opportunities could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of RAI.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, RAI is restricted from pursuing alternative takeover proposals. If the BAT Merger is not completed, BAT\u2019s significant beneficial ownership interest in RAI could deter future acquisition proposals and make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of RAI without the cooperation of BAT. This could have a negative effect on the price of RAI common stock.\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, RAI is restricted from pursuing alternative takeover proposals to the BAT Merger. Should RAI pursue an alternative takeover proposal instead of the BAT Merger, in certain instances, RAI would be required to pay a termination fee to BAT of $1 billion. Further, if the BAT Merger is not completed, BAT, through its subsidiaries, could vote its shares of RAI common stock against any future takeover proposal submitted for shareholder approval or refuse to accept any tender offer for shares of RAI common stock. As a result, it would make it very difficult for a third party to acquire RAI without BAT consent. BAT\u2019s beneficial ownership interest in RAI and these defenses could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of RAI. These deterrents could adversely affect the price of RAI common stock and make it very difficult to remove or replace members of the board of directors or management of RAI without cooperation of BAT.\nIn the event that the BAT Merger is not completed, RAI shareholders may be adversely affected if all or part of the Governance Agreement were to be terminated because in some circumstances the board composition and share transfer restrictions on BAT and its subsidiaries would no longer apply. These developments could enable BAT and its subsidiaries to, among other things, acquire some or all of the shares of RAI common stock not held by BAT and its subsidiaries, seek additional representation on RAI\u2019s Board, replace existing RAI directors, solicit proxies, otherwise influence or gain control of RAI or transfer all or a significant percentage of their shares of RAI common stock to a third party.\nThe Governance Agreement provides that it will terminate automatically in its entirety if BAT and its subsidiaries own either 100% or less than 15% or if any third party or group controls more than 50% of the voting power of all RAI shares. In addition, BAT and B&W may terminate the Governance Agreement in its entirety if B&W nominees proposed in accordance with the Governance Agreement are not elected to serve on RAI\u2019s Board or its committees or if RAI has deprived B&W nominees of such representation for \u201cfiduciary\u201d reasons or has willfully deprived B&W or its board nominees of any veto rights.\nBAT and B&W also may terminate the obligation to vote their shares of RAI common stock for Board-proposed director nominees, the restriction on Board representation in excess of proportionate representation and the RAI share transfer restrictions of the Governance Agreement if RAI willfully and deliberately breaches the provisions regarding B&W\u2019s Board and Board committee representation.\nIn the event that the BAT Merger is not completed and the share transfer restrictions in the Governance Agreement are terminated, there will be no contractual restrictions on the ability of BAT and its subsidiaries to sell or transfer their shares of RAI common stock on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. These sales or transfers could create a substantial decline in the price of shares of RAI common stock or, if these sales or transfers were made to a single buyer or group of buyers that own shares of RAI common stock, could result in a third party acquiring control of or influence over RAI.\nThe bylaws of RAI designate the state courts of North Carolina or the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina as the sole and exclusive forum for certain legal actions, which could limit the ability of RAI shareholders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with RAI.\nRAI\u2019s bylaws provide that, unless RAI consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the state courts of North Carolina or the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina will be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n\u2022\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of RAI;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of RAI to RAI or its shareholders;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the North Carolina Business Corporation Act, the bylaws or the articles of incorporation of RAI (as each may be amended from time to time); or\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of RAI\u2019s capital stock may be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions described above. This forum selection provision may limit RAI shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a judicial forum that they find favorable for certain disputes with RAI or its directors, officers or other employees or shareholders.", "PERMNO": 86946, "SIC": 2111, "TIC": "RAI"}
