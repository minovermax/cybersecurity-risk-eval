{"cik": "806172", "company": "SONO TEK CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-05-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in the future.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the outbreak of respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in authorities worldwide implementing numerous measures to contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, border controls, limitations on business activity, social distancing requirements, quarantines, and shelter-in-place orders. These measures have caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas, both regionally and worldwide. The impact of the pandemic on our business and operations and our ability to execute our strategic plans remains uncertain and will depend on many unpredictable factors outside of our control, including, without limitation, the extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic; the development, availability and distribution of vaccines and other effective treatments to treat the COVID-19 virus and any new variants thereof; the emergence of new variants that are more contagious, symptomatic or fatal and the time the medical community requires to respond to such variants; the imposition of and compliance with protective public safety measures; the impact of the pandemic on the global economy; and the related impacts on our development pipeline and demand for our products.\nIn 2020, we initiated several precautions in accordance with local regulations and guidelines to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 across our businesses. These precautions have impacted the way we carry out our business, including limiting travel to and attendance at trade shows and visiting existing and prospective customers, additional sanitation and cleaning procedures in our production and other facilities, temperature and symptom confirmations, remote working when possible, and implementation of social distancing and staggered worktime requirements for our employees who must work on-site. If we are required to continue such measures for an extended period of time, it could impact the ability of our employees to collaborate efficiently. In addition, the loss or unavailability of our production staff or other key employees and executives, as a result of sickness of employees or their families or the responsibility of employees to manage family obligations while working from home, could negatively impact our business and operations and our ability to operate or execute our business strategy. Continued employee telecommuting activity also increases the risk of a security breach of our information technology systems. The changed environment under which we are operating could have an impact on our internal controls over financial reporting.\nMoreover, the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in interruptions or delays in the operations of regulatory authorities, which may impact review or approval timelines; delays in necessary interactions with other agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees; termination of, or difficulties in procuring or maintaining, arrangements with third parties upon whom we depend such as manufacturers, including contract manufacturing organizations, suppliers and other strategic partners; and disruptions or restrictions on our ability to pursue partnerships and other business transactions. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have not experienced significant disruption or delays in our global supply chain. If the COVID-19 pandemic worsens, however, we may experience supply disruptions due to temporary closures, production slowdowns, staffing shortages, logistics, delays and disruptions in the manufacture and/or shipment of our products.\nThe effects of a prolonged pandemic could result in a continued negative impact on investment in our principal markets. In addition, if COVID-19 impacts the financial position of our customers, we may have difficulty collecting receivables and our business and results of operations could be exposed to risks associated with uncollectible accounts or defaults on contractual payment obligations by our collaboration partners. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations due to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, we may need to raise additional funds. The duration and severity of any further economic or market impact of the pandemic remains uncertain, and there can be no assurance that it will not have an adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources, including our ability to access capital markets, in the future, on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nWe do not have long-term commitments for significant revenues with most of our customers and may be unable to retain existing customers, attract new customers or replace departing customers with new customers that can provide comparable revenues and profit margins.\nBecause we generally do not obtain firm, long-term volume purchase commitments from our customers, most of our sales are derived from individual purchase orders. We remain dependent upon securing new purchase orders in the future in order to sustain and grow our revenues. Accordingly, there is no assurance that our revenues and business will grow in the future. Our failure to maintain and expand our customer relationships could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn recent years, a few major customers and distributors have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue. Our revenue could decline if we are unable to maintain or develop relationships with additional customers or distributors and our results of operations could be adversely affected if any one of these customers is unable to meet their financial obligations to us.\nFor the year ended February 28, 2022, our two largest customers accounted for approximately 24% of our net sales. For the year ended February 28, 2021, our three largest customers accounted for approximately 28% of our net sales. If we are unable to diversify our customer base, our future results will be heavily dependent on these customers and distributors. Our dependence on a limited number of customers and distributors means that the loss of a major customer or distributor or any reduction in orders by a major customer or distributor would materially reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations. We expect that sales to relatively few customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales for the foreseeable future; however, these customers or our other customers, may not use our products at current levels in the future, if at all. Customer purchase orders may be delayed or cancelled, and order volume levels can be changed with loss of deposit as the only penalty. We may not be able to replace cancelled, delayed, or reduced purchase orders with new orders. If any one of these customers reduces its demand for our products, it will likely have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nFurthermore, a significant portion of our accounts receivables is concentrated with a few major customers, who may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us. The failure of any such customers to pay amounts owed to us in a timely fashion or at all could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. The Company is also exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company's outstanding receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company's exposure to credit and collectability risk on its receivables may also be higher in certain international markets, and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its receivables, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and avoid losses.\nWe will need to raise additional funds to develop our business, which may adversely affect our future growth.\nWe may finance a portion of our anticipated future growth and possibly future strategic acquisitions through public or private equity offerings or debt financings. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay or reduce the scope of, our plans to grow our revenues or to consummate one or more strategic acquisitions or otherwise to scale back our business plans. In addition, we could be forced to reduce or forego attractive business opportunities. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. In addition, debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. We may seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. Our access to the financial markets and the pricing and terms we receive in the financial markets could be adversely impacted by various factors, including changes in financial markets and interest rates.\nWe may be adversely affected by global and regional economic conditions and military, legislative, regulatory and political developments.\nWe sell our products around the world, and we expect to continue to derive a substantial portion of sales from outside the U.S. The uncertain macroeconomic environment caused by the outbreak of COVID-19 may adversely affect our results and could have a negative impact on demand for our products. In addition, we are currently operating in a period of economic uncertainty and capital markets disruption, which has been significantly impacted by geopolitical instability due to the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any negative impact on the global economy and capital markets resulting from the conflict in Ukraine or any other geopolitical tensions.\nCustomers or suppliers may experience cash flow problems and as a result, may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products, and suppliers may significantly and quickly increase their prices or reduce their output. Additionally, if customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are precluded from securing financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, amounts owed to us. Any inability of current and/or potential customers to purchase our products and/or to pay us for our products may adversely affect our sales, earnings and cash flow. Sales and earnings could also be affected by our ability to manage the risks and uncertainties associated with the application of local legal requirements or the enforceability of laws and contractual obligations, trade protection measures, changes in tax laws, regional political instability, war, terrorist activities, severe or prolonged adverse weather conditions and natural disasters as well as health epidemics or pandemics.\nOur success will depend, to a large degree, on the expertise and experience of the members of our management team, the loss of whom could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success is, to a large degree, dependent upon the expertise and experience of the management team and its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel who are technically proficient. The loss of the services of one or more of such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to continue to attract and retain such personnel.\nWe will need to add qualified additional personnel as we expand our business, and we may not be able to employ such persons, which could affect our ability to expand and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn order to expand our product offerings and customer base, we will need to hire additional qualified personnel. We may not be able to identify such persons, and even if we identify them, we may not have the funds or ability to employ them, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAlthough we have not experienced any material disruptions due to labor shortages to date, we have observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base, whether caused by COVID-19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, and could negatively affect our ability to complete our projects according to the required schedule or otherwise efficiently operate our business. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high level, or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability, such as overtime and third-party outsourcing, have unintended negative effects, our business could be adversely affected. An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation, caused by COVID-19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could have a material adverse impact on our operations, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.\nIf we are unable to manage our expected growth, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe expect to expand our operations, including by expanding our internal resources, making acquisitions and entering into new markets, and we intend to continue to focus on rapid growth, including organic growth and possibly acquisitions. The growth of our business could place significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources. To manage our future growth, we could be required to improve existing or implement new operational or financial systems, procedures and controls or expand, train and manage a growing employee base. Our failure to accomplish any of these tasks could materially and adversely affect our business. Even if we are successful in integrating future acquisitions into our existing operations, we may not derive the benefits, such as operational or administrative synergies, that we expected from such acquisitions, which may result in the investment of our capital resources without realizing the expected returns on such investment.\nOur inability to protect our intellectual property rights could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part upon developing, maintaining and/or protecting intellectual property rights relevant to our ultrasonic nozzles and coating processes. We rely principally on a combination of patent protection, trade secret laws, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, and trusted business relationships to establish, maintain and protect the intellectual property rights relevant to our business. These measures, however, may not be adequate in every given case to permit us to gain or retain any competitive advantage, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.\nWhere we consider it appropriate, we may seek patent protection in the United States on technologies used in, or relating to, our ultrasonic nozzles, applications and manufacturing processes. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its scope, validity and enforceability. Thus, any patent or patent application which may issue into a patent held by us could be challenged, invalidated or held unenforceable in litigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and/or other patent tribunals or circumvented by others. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of patent claims has emerged to date in the United States, and the landscape could become more uncertain in view of future rule changes by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the introduction of patent reform legislation and decisions in patent law cases by United States federal courts. The patent landscape outside the United States is even less predictable. As a result, the validity and enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, we may fail to apply for patents on important technologies or product candidates in a timely fashion, if at all, and our existing and future patents may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from utilizing our technologies or from developing competing products or technologies.\nOur patent strategy involves complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary technology may depend in part upon our success in obtaining patent rights and enforcing those rights once granted or licensed. Our issued patents and those that may be issued in the future may be challenged, invalidated, rendered unenforceable or circumvented, which could limit our ability to prevent competitors from marketing similar or related products, or shorten the term of patent protection that we may have for our products, processes and enabling technologies. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies, duplicate technology developed by us or otherwise possess intellectual property rights that could limit our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business.\nWe also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Trade secrets, however, can be difficult to protect. We may not be able to maintain our technology or know-how as trade secrets, and competitors may develop or acquire equally valuable or more valuable technology or know-how related to the manufacture of comparable ultrasonic nozzles. We also seek to protect our confidential and proprietary information, in part, by requiring all employees, consultants and business partners to execute confidentiality and/or nondisclosure agreements upon the commencement of any employment, consulting arrangement or engagement with us. These agreements generally require that all confidential and proprietary information developed by the employee, consultant, or business partner, or made known to the employee, consultant or business partner by us, during the course of the relationship with us, be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. These agreements may be breached and may not provide adequate remedies in the event of breach. To the extent that our employees, consultants, or business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for and/or with us, disputes could arise as to the rights in related or resulting technologies, know-how or inventions. Moreover, while we also require customers and vendors to execute agreements containing confidentiality and/or nondisclosure provisions, we may not have obtained such agreements from all of our customers and vendors. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors, customers, or vendors. Such customers or vendors may also be subject to laws and regulations that require them to disclose information that we would otherwise seek to keep confidential.\nMoreover, others may independently develop and obtain patents covering technologies that are similar or superior to the product forms, applications, or manufacturing processes that we employ. If that happens, we may need to obtain licenses for these technologies and may not be able to obtain licenses on reasonable terms, if at all, which could limit our ability to manufacture our future products and operate our business. In addition, third parties could utilize our intellectual property rights in territories where we do not have intellectual property protection. Such third parties may then try to import products made using our intellectual property rights into the United States or other countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe could become subject to intellectual property litigation that could be costly, limit or cancel our intellectual property rights, divert time and efforts away from business operations, require us to pay damages and/or otherwise have an adverse material impact on our business.\nThe success of our business is highly dependent on protecting our intellectual property rights. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products and/or enabling technologies. Policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights is difficult and expensive, as is enforcing these rights against unauthorized use by others. Identifying unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights is difficult because we may be unable to monitor the processes and/or materials being employed by other parties. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, particularly in foreign countries where enforcement of intellectual property rights may be more difficult than in the United States.\nOur continued commercial success will also depend in part upon not infringing the patents or violating the intellectual property rights of third parties. We are aware of patents and patent applications generally relating to aspects of our technologies filed by, and issued to, third parties. Nevertheless, we cannot determine with certainty whether such patents or patent applications of other parties may materially affect our ability to conduct our business. There may be existing patents of which we are unaware that we may inadvertently infringe, resulting in claims against us or our customers. In the event that the manufacture, use and/or sale of our products or processes is challenged, or if our product forms or processes conflict with the patent rights of others, third parties could bring legal actions against us or our customers in the United States, Asia, Europe or other countries, claiming damages and seeking to enjoin the manufacturing and/or marketing of our products. Additionally, it is not possible to predict with certainty what patent claims may issue from any relevant third-party pending patent applications. Third parties may be able to obtain patents with claims relating to our product forms, applications and/or manufacturing processes which they could attempt to assert against us or our customers.\nIn either case, litigation may be necessary to enforce, protect or defend our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others. Any litigation could be unsuccessful, cause us to incur substantial costs, divert resources and the efforts of our personnel away from daily operations, harm our reputation and/or result in the impairment of our intellectual property rights. In some cases, litigation may be threatened or brought by a patent holding company or other adverse patent owner who has no relevant product revenues and against which our patents may provide little or no deterrence. If we are found to infringe any patents, we could be required to (1) pay substantial monetary damages, including lost profits, reasonable royalties and/or treble damages if an infringement is found to be willful and/or (2) totally discontinue or substantially modify any products or processes that are found to be in violation of another party\u2019s intellectual property rights. If our competitors are able to use our technology without payment to us, our ability to compete effectively could be harmed.\nThe markets within which we compete are highly competitive. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do and one or more of these competitors could use their greater financial and other resources to gain market share at our expense.\nIf our business continues to develop as expected, we anticipate that our revenues will continue to grow. If, due to capital constraints or otherwise, we are unable to fulfill our existing backlog in a timely manner and/or procure and timely fulfill our anticipated future backlog, our customers and potential customers may decide to use competing systems or products. If we are unable to fulfill the demand for products and systems in a timely manner, our customers and potential customers may choose to purchase products from our competitors. In addition, we could face new competition from large international or domestic companies with established industrial brands and distribution networks that enter our end markets. Demand for our products may also be affected by our ability to respond to changes in design and functionality, to respond to downward pricing pressure, and to provide shorter lead times for our products than our competitors. If we are unable to respond successfully to these competitive pressures, we could lose market share, which could have an adverse impact on our results. We cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully in our markets or compete effectively against current and new competitors as our industry continues to evolve.\nRapid technological changes may prevent us from remaining current with our technological resources and maintaining competitive product and service offerings.\nThe markets in which we and our customers operate are characterized by rapid technological change. Significant technological changes could render our existing and potential new products, systems and technology obsolete. Our future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to:\n\u00b7 effectively identify and develop leading technologies;\n\u00b7 continue to develop our technical expertise;\n\u00b7 enhance our current products and systems with new, improved and competitive technology; and\n\u00b7 respond to technological changes in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nIf we are unable to successfully respond to technological change or if we do not respond to it in a cost-effective and timely manner, then our business will be materially and adversely affected. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in responding to changing technology. In addition, technologies developed by others may render our products, systems and technology uncompetitive or obsolete. Even if we do successfully respond to technological advances, the integration of new technology may require substantial time and expense, and we cannot assure you that we will succeed in adapting our products, systems and technology in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nIf we are unable to continue to develop new and enhanced products and systems that achieve market acceptance in a timely manner, our competitive position and operating results could be harmed.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to continue to develop new and enhanced ultrasonic nozzles and coating systems and related products that achieve market acceptance in a timely and cost-effective manner. The markets in which we and our customers operate are characterized by frequent introductions of new and enhanced products and services, evolving industry standards and regulatory requirements, government incentives and changes in customer needs. The successful development and market acceptance of our products and systems, depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global markets;\n\u00b7 the changing requirements and preferences of the potential customers in our markets;\n\u00b7 the accurate prediction of market requirements, including regulatory issues;\n\u00b7 the timely completion and introduction of new products and systems to avoid obsolescence;\n\u00b7 the quality, price and performance of new products and systems;\n\u00b7 the availability, quality, price and performance of competing products and systems;\n\u00b7 our customer service and support capabilities and responsiveness;\n\u00b7 the successful development of our relationships with existing and potential customers; and\n\u00b7 changes in industry standards.\nWe may experience financial or technical difficulties or limitations that could prevent us from introducing new or enhanced products or systems. Furthermore, any of these new or enhanced products and systems could contain problems that are discovered after they are introduced. We may need to significantly modify the design of these products and systems to correct problems. Rapidly changing industry standards and customer preferences and requirements may impede market acceptance of our products and systems.\nDevelopment and enhancement of our products and systems will require significant additional investment and could strain our management, financial and operational resources. The lack of market acceptance of our products or systems or our inability to generate sufficient revenues from this development or enhancement to offset their development costs could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may experience delays or other problems in releasing new products and systems and enhancements, and any such delays or problems may cause customers to forego purchases of our products and systems and to purchase those of our competitors.\nWe cannot provide assurance that products and systems that we have recently developed or that we develop in the future will achieve market acceptance. If our new products and systems fail to achieve market acceptance, or if we fail to develop new or enhanced products and systems that achieve market acceptance, our growth prospects, operating results and competitive position could be adversely affected.\nWe manufacture and assemble all our products at one facility. Any prolonged disruption in the operations of this facility would result in a decline in our sales and profitability.\nWe manufacture and assemble our products and systems at our production facility located in Milton, New York. Any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing and assembly facility, whether due to the COVID-19 pandemic, equipment or information technology infrastructure failure, labor difficulties, destruction of or damage to this facility as a result of a hurricane, earthquake, fire, flood, other catastrophes, and other operational problems would result in a decline in our sales and profitability. In the event of a business interruption at our facility, we may be unable to shift manufacturing and assembly capabilities to alternate locations, accept materials from suppliers or meet customer shipment needs, among other severe consequences. Such an event could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of our operations.\nFailure to obtain adequate supplies of components and raw materials or failure to obtain components or raw materials at affordable prices could negatively affect our ability to supply products to our customers and negatively affect our profit margins.\nWe use a variety of components and raw materials in the manufacture of our products. As other industries develop products utilizing similar components and raw materials that we use, we may not be able to obtain adequate supplies of components and raw materials required for the manufacture of our existing and future products that would prevent us from supplying products to our customers and materially affect our business. Furthermore, any increased demand for, the raising of tariff rates on, or an increase of non-tariff trade barriers that apply to the components and raw materials that we use could increase the price we must pay to obtain them and could adversely affect our profitability, which would have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nRecently, we have encountered challenges in our supply of various materials and components, and electronic components in particular, due to well-documented shortages and constraints in the global supply chain. Lead times for ordered components may vary significantly, and some components used to manufacture our products are provided by a limited number of sources. We have experienced lengthened lead times throughout our supply chain as a result of supply chain constraints and material shortages that have occurred in the recent months, and may continue through fiscal year 2023. This has been exacerbated by the recent resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic in certain parts of China, which has resulted in the temporary closure of manufacturing facilities, including those that make electronic parts like those that we included in our products, in certain parts of China.\nWe may rely on sub-contractors to meet current demand for our products, and we may need to obtain additional manufacturing capacity in order to increase production of our existing products or to produce our proposed new products, the failure of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe may not have sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the current demand for our products, and we may need to rely on subcontractors to enable us to meet this demand. Since we may rely on our subcontractors for a significant amount of our production capacity, the loss of the services of our subcontractors would have a material adverse effect on our business. Our plans for the growth of our business rely upon increasing sales of our existing products and systems and developing and marketing new products. We may not have adequate internal manufacturing facilities to substantially increase production of our products and obtaining additional manufacturing capacity in-house could require substantial capital expenditures. We may not have the capital resources to obtain or construct new facilities to expand manufacturing capacity and meet increasing demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Conversely, any significant decrease in demand for our products could create idle plant capacity and an inability to cover fixed costs, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to risks related to our international sales, and the failure to manage these risks could harm our business.\nIn addition to our sales to customers within the U.S. and Canada, we may become increasingly dependent on sales to customers outside the U.S. and Canada as we pursue expanding our business with customers worldwide. In the fiscal years ended February 28, 2022 and 2021, our sales outside of the U.S. and Canada accounted for approximately 68% and 65%, respectively, of total revenue. We continue to expect that a significant portion of our future revenues will be from international sales. As a result, the occurrence of any international, political, economic, or geographic event could result in a significant decline in revenue. There are significant risks associated with conducting operations internationally, requiring significant financial commitments to support such operations. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal control and disclosure rules, data privacy and filtering requirements, anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations, among others.\nViolations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\nSome of the risks and challenges of conducting business internationally include:\n\u00b7 the impact of COVID-19 on the global markets;\n\u00b7 requirements or preferences for domestic products or solutions, which could reduce demand for our products;\n\u00b7 unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 restrictions on the import or export of critical technology;\n\u00b7 management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural and geographic dispersion;\n\u00b7 the burden of complying with a variety of laws and regulations in various countries;\n\u00b7 difficulties in enforcing contracts;\n\u00b7 the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u00b7 application of the income tax laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions, including relatively low-rate and relatively high-rate jurisdictions, to our sales and other transactions, which results in additional complexity and uncertainty;\n\u00b7 tariffs and trade barriers, export regulations and other regulatory and contractual limitations on our ability to sell products;\n\u00b7 failure to comply with both U.S. and foreign laws, including export and antitrust regulations, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices;\n\u00b7 heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of, or irregularities in, financial statements;\n\u00b7 potentially adverse tax consequences, including multiple and possibly overlapping tax structures;\n\u00b7 general economic and geopolitical conditions, including war and acts of terrorism;\n\u00b7 lack of the availability of qualified third-party financing; and\n\u00b7 currency exchange controls.\nWhile these factors and the impacts of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nAny liability damages resulting from technical faults or failures of our products could be substantial and could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur products are used by customers and integrated into customers\u2019 machines and systems, and therefore a malfunction or the inadequate design of our products could result in product liability claims. Any liability for damages resulting from technical faults or failures could be substantial and could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, a well-publicized actual or perceived problem could adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of our products, which would materially impact our financial condition and operating results.\nInflationary Pressures and Rising Prices for Goods and Services.\nInflation rose sharply at the end of 2021 and has continued rising in 2022 at levels not seen for over 40 years. Inflationary pressures are currently expected to remain elevated throughout 2022. Small to medium-sized businesses may be impacted more during periods of high inflation as they are not as able to leverage economics of scale to mitigate cost pressures compared to larger businesses. Inflation has the potential to adversely affect our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations by increasing our overall cost structure, particularly if we are unable to achieve commensurate increases in the prices we charge our customers. The existence of inflation in the economy has resulted in, and may continue to result in, higher interest rates and capital costs, shipping costs, supply shortages, increased costs of labor, weakening exchange rates and other similar effects. As a result of inflation, we have experienced and may continue to experience, cost increases. Although we may take measures to mitigate the impact of this inflation, if these measures are not effective our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. Even if such measures are effective, there could be a difference between the timing of when these beneficial actions impact our results of operations and when the cost inflation is incurred.\nWe could become liable for damages resulting from our manufacturing activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or cause us to cease operations.\nThe nature of our manufacturing operations exposes us to potential claims and liability for environmental damage, personal injury, loss of life and damage to, or destruction of, property. Our manufacturing operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations that govern environmental protection and human health and safety. These laws and regulations have changed frequently in the past and it is reasonable to expect additional and more stringent changes in the future. Our manufacturing operations may not comply with future laws and regulations, and we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures to bring our operations within compliance with such evolving regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, manufacturing guidelines, and workplace safety requirements, governmental authorities may seek to impose fines and penalties on us or to revoke or deny the issuance or renewal of operating permits, and private parties may seek damages from us. Under such circumstances, we could be required to curtail or cease operations, conduct site remediation or other corrective action, or pay substantial damage claims for which may not have sufficient or any insurance coverage for claims.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and to disclose in our filing if such controls were unable to provide assurance that a material error would be prevented or detected in a timely manner. We have an ongoing program to review the design of our internal controls framework in keeping with changes in business needs, implement necessary changes to our controls design and test the system and process controls necessary to comply with these requirements. If in the future, our internal controls over financial reporting are determined to be not effective resulting in a material weakness or significant deficiency, investor perceptions regarding the reliability of our financial statements may be adversely affected which could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nWe may have risks associated with security of our information technology systems.\nWe make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information technology systems and data. Despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such systems, it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. There is a risk of industrial espionage, cyber-attacks, misuse or theft of information or assets, or damage to assets by people who may gain unauthorized access to our facilities, systems, or information. Such cybersecurity breaches, misuse, or other disruptions could lead to the disclosure of confidential information; improper usage and distribution of our intellectual property; theft, manipulation, and destruction of private and proprietary data; and production downtimes. Although we actively employ measures to prevent unauthorized access to our information systems, preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our rights is inherently difficult. These events could adversely affect our financial results and any legal action in connection with any such cybersecurity breach could be costly and time-consuming and may divert management\u2019s attention and adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of us and our products. In addition, we must frequently expand our internal information system to meet increasing demand in storage, computing and communication, which may result in increased costs. Our internal information system is expensive to expand and must be highly secure due to the sensitive nature of our customers\u2019 information that we transmit. Building and managing the support necessary for our growth places significant demands on our management and resources. These demands may divert such resources from the continued growth of our business and implementation of our business strategy.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nFuture equity financings would dilute your ownership and could adversely affect your common stock ownership rights in comparison with those of other security holders.\nOur board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of common without stockholder approval. Our stockholders do not have preemptive rights to any common stock issued by us in the future; therefore, stockholders may experience additional dilution of their equity investment if we issue additional shares of common stock in the future, including shares issuable under equity incentive plans, or if we issue securities that are convertible into shares of our common stock.\nIf additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage of ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced, and such newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If we issue additional common stock or securities convertible into common stock, such issuance will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of each other stockholder. In addition, such stock issuances might result in a reduction of the market value of our common stock, which could make our stock unattractive to existing stockholders.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could discourage changes in the composition of our board of directors which could hinder an acquisition of us by a third party, even if the acquisition would be favorable to you, thereby adversely affecting existing stockholders.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying attempts by others to obtain control of our board of directors and our Company, even when these attempts may be in the best interests of stockholders. For example, our articles of incorporation and bylaws provide for a classified board of directors which could delay or prevent changes in our control or management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices. These provisions may also limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.\nThere is limited trading volume of our common stock, which could make it difficult for you to liquidate an investment in our common stock in a timely manner.\nSince August 27, 2021, our common stock has been traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol SOTK. Because there is limited volume in our common stock, investors may not be able to liquidate their investments when they desire to do so.\nIn addition, if we fail to meet the criteria set forth in SEC and Nasdaq Capital Market rules and regulations, various requirements would be imposed by law on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Consequently, such regulations may deter broker-dealers from recommending or selling our common stock, which may further affect its liquidity.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade us or our sector, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades us, the industry in which we operate, or the stock of any of our competitors, the price of our common stock may decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage altogether, we could lose visibility, which could also lead to a decline in the price of our common stock.\nOur operating results can fluctuate significantly from period to period, which makes our operating results difficult to predict and can cause our operating results, in any particular period, to be less than comparable periods and expectations from time to time.\nOur operating results have fluctuated significantly from quarter-to-quarter, period-to-period and year-to-year during our operating history and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Certain factors that may affect our operating results include, without limitation, those set forth under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -Critical Accounting Policies\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBecause we have little or no control over many of these factors, our operating results are difficult to predict. Any adverse change in any of these factors could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nOur revenues, net income and other operating results are heavily dependent upon the size and timing of customer orders and projects, and the timing of the completion of those projects. The timing of our receipt of large individual orders, and of project completion, is difficult for us to predict. Because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenues over the mid- and long-term and because a high percentage of our operating expenses are relatively fixed, a shortfall or delay in recognizing revenues can cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and can result in significant operating losses or declines in profit margins in any particular quarter. If our revenues fall below our expectations in any particular quarter, we may not be able, or it may not be prudent for us, to reduce our expenses rapidly in response to the revenue shortfall, which can result in us suffering significant operating losses or declines in profit margins in that quarter.\nDue to these factors and the other risks discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter, period-to-period or year-to-year comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Quarterly, period and annual comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of future performance. As a result, it is likely that, from time to time, our results of operations or our revenue backlog could fall below historical levels or the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and fluctuates widely in response to various factors that are beyond our control. The price of our common stock is not necessarily indicative of our operating performance or long-term business prospects. In addition, the securities markets have from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Factors such as the following could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially:\n\u2022 the underlying price of the commodities, materials, equipment that affect our key markets;\n\u2022 announcements of capital budget changes by major customers;\n\u2022 the introduction of new products by our competitors;\n\u2022 announcements of technology advances by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 current events affecting the political and economic environment in the United States, Europe or Asia;\n\u2022 conditions or industry trends, including demand for our products, services and technological advances;\n\u2022 changes to financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;\n\u2022 additions or departures of our key personnel;\n\u2022 seasonal, economic, or financial conditions;\n\u2022 our quarterly operating and financial results; or\n\u2022 litigation or public concern about the safety of our products;\n\u2022 the impact of inflation;\n\u2022 war in Ukraine; or\n\u2022 the effect of COVID-19.\nThe realization of any of these risks and other factors beyond our control could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly. The stock market in general experiences, from time to time, extreme price and volume fluctuations. Periodic and/or continuous market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of our common stock. Price volatility may be worse if the trading volume of our common stock is low.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception that future sales may occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nIf any significant number of our outstanding shares are sold, such sales could have a depressive effect on the market price of our stock. We are unable to predict the effect, if any, that the sale of shares, or the availability of shares for future sale, will have on the market price of the shares prevailing from time to time. Sales of substantial numbers of shares in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress prevailing market prices for the shares. Such sales may also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nThe Company is considered a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and is exempt from certain disclosure requirements, which could make our common stock less attractive to potential investors.\nRule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") defines a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as an issuer that is not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent, that is not a smaller reporting company, and that had a public float of less than $250 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter, computed by multiplying the aggregate worldwide number of shares of its voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates by the price at which the common equity was last sold, or the average of the bid and asked prices of common equity, in the principal market for the common equity.\nAs a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we are not required and may not include a Compensation Discussion and Analysis section in our proxy statements; we provide only three years of business information; and have other \u201cscaled\u201d disclosure requirements that are less comprehensive than issuers that are not \u201csmaller reporting companies,\u201d which could make our stock less attractive to potential investors and could make it more difficult for shareholders to sell their shares.\nWe have no current plan to pay dividends on our common stock, and investors may lose the entire amount of their investment.\nWe have no current plans to pay dividends on our common stock; therefore, investors will not receive any funds absent a sale of their shares. We cannot assure investors of a positive return on their investment when they sell their shares, nor can we assure that investors will not lose the entire amount of their investment.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nWe will continue to incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management may be required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives that ultimately could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a public company, we expect to continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, have imposed various requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls as well as mandating certain corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will continue to devote a substantial amount of time and financial resources to these compliance initiatives.\nAs a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d we are able to take advantage of certain exceptions to disclosure requirements, including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and the exemption from providing a \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d section in our proxy statements; providing only three years of business information; and other \u201cscaled\u201d disclosure requirements that are less comprehensive than issuers that are not smaller reporting companies.\nIf we fail to staff our accounting and finance function adequately or maintain internal control systems adequate to meet the demands that are placed upon us as a public company, we may be unable to report our financial results accurately or in a timely manner and our business and stock price may suffer. The costs of being a public company, as well as diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, may have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) could adversely affect our financial results and may require significant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. The FASB periodically issues new accounting standards on a variety of topics. For information regarding new accounting standards, please refer to Note 1 and 2, \u201cDescription of Business and Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These and other such standards generally result in different accounting principles, which may significantly impact our reported results or could result in variability of our financial results.\nIn preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements, which, if not accurate, may significantly impact our financial results.\nWe make assumptions, judgments and estimates for a number of items, including the fair value of financial instruments, long-lived assets and other intangible assets; the realizability of deferred tax assets; the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock option awards; and others. We also make assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for revenue recognition, product warranties, employee-related liabilities, including commissions and variable compensation, and in determining the allowance or provisions for uncertain tax positions, doubtful accounts, excess or obsolete inventory, and legal contingencies. These assumptions, judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates, and such differences could significantly impact our financial results.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our securities.\nIn recent years, shareholder activists have become involved in numerous public companies. Shareholder activists frequently propose to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction and operations of the Company. Such proposals may disrupt our business and divert the attention of our Board of Directors, management and employees, and any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan, be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, all of which could adversely affect our business. A proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting could also require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses. In addition, actions of activist shareholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.", "PERMNO": 11153, "SIC": 3690, "TIC": "SOTK"}
