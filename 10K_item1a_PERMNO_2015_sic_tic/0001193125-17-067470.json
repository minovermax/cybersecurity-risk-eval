{"cik": "1674168", "company": "Hilton Grand Vacations Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business, and in reviewing our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe are subject to the business, financial and operating risks inherent to the timeshare industry, any of which could reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth.\nOur business is subject to a number of business, financial and operating risks inherent to the timeshare industry, including:\n\u2022\nsignificant competition from other timeshare businesses and hospitality providers in the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022\nmarket and/or consumer perception of timeshare companies and the industry in general;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating costs, including energy, food, employee compensation and benefits and insurance;\n\u2022\nincreases in costs due to inflation or otherwise, including increases in our operating costs, that may not be fully offset by price and fee increases in our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in taxes and governmental regulations that influence or set wages, prices, interest rates or construction and maintenance procedures and costs;\n\u2022\nthe costs and administrative burdens associated with complying with applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nsignificant increases in cost for health care coverage for employees and potential government regulation with respect to health care coverage;\n\u2022\nshortages of labor or labor disruptions;\n\u2022\nincreases in the use of third-party and competitor internet services to book hotel reservations, secure short-term lodging accommodations and market vacation rental properties;\n\u2022\nthe availability and cost of capital necessary for us and third-party developers with whom we do business to fund investments, capital expenditures and service debt obligations;\n\u2022\nour ability to securitize the receivables that we originate in connection with VOI sales;\n\u2022\ndelays in or cancellations of planned or future development or refurbishment projects;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition of third-party developers with whom we do business;\n\u2022\nrelationships with third-party developers, our Club members and HOAs;\n\u2022\nchanges in desirability of geographic regions of our resorts and affiliated resorts, geographic concentration of our operations and shortages of desirable locations for development;\n\u2022\nchanges in the supply and demand for our products and services;\n\u2022\nprivate resales of VOIs and the sale of VOIs in the secondary market; and\n\u2022\nunlawful or deceptive third-party VOI resale or vacation package sales schemes.\nAny of these factors could increase our costs or limit or reduce the prices we are able to charge for our products and services or otherwise affect our ability to maintain existing properties, develop new properties or source VOI supply from third parties. As a result, any of these factors can reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth.\nMacroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect and reduce demand for our products and services.\nMacroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can reduce demand for our products and services, including demand for timeshare properties. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic conditions, including low consumer confidence, unemployment levels and depressed real estate prices resulting from the severity and duration of any downturn in the U.S. or global economy;\n\u2022\nwar, political conditions or civil unrest, violence or terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events;\n\u2022\nthe financial and general business condition of the travel industry;\n\u2022\nstatements, actions or interventions by governmental officials related to travel and the resulting negative public perception of such travel;\n\u2022\nconditions that negatively shape public perception of travel, including travel-related accidents and outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, such as Ebola, avian flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1 (swine flu) and the Zika virus;\n\u2022\ncyber-attacks;\n\u2022\nclimate change or availability of natural resources;\n\u2022\nnatural or manmade disasters, such as earthquakes, windstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, floods, drought, fires, oil spills and nuclear incidents;\n\u2022\nchanges in the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of customers; and\n\u2022\norganized labor activities, which could cause a diversion of business from resorts involved in labor negotiations and loss of business generally for the resorts we manage as a result of certain labor tactics.\nAny one or more of these factors can adversely affect, and from time to time have adversely affected, individual resorts, particular regions and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nContraction in the global economy or low levels of economic growth could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth.\nConsumer demand for products and services provided by the timeshare industry is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels. Decreased global or regional demand for products and services provided by the timeshare industry can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth, and the recovery period in our industry may lag overall economic improvement. Declines in demand for our products and services due to general economic conditions could negatively affect our business by decreasing the revenues we are able to generate from our VOI sales, financing activities and Club and resort operations. In addition, many of the expenses associated with our business, including personnel costs, interest, rent, property taxes, insurance and utilities, are relatively fixed. During a period of overall economic weakness, if we are unable to meaningfully decrease these costs as demand for our products and services decreases, our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected.\nWe do not own the Hilton brands and our business will be materially harmed if we breach our license agreement with Hilton or it is terminated.\nFollowing the spin-off, Hilton retained ownership of the Hilton-branded trademarks, tradenames and certain related intellectual property used in the operation of our business. We entered into a license agreement with Hilton granting us the right to use the Hilton-branded trademarks, trade names and related intellectual property in our business for the term of the agreement. If we breach our obligations under the license agreement, Hilton may be entitled to terminate the license agreement or terminate our rights to use the Hilton brands and other Hilton intellectual property at properties that do not meet applicable standards and policies, or to exercise other remedies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.\nThe termination of the license agreement or exercise of other remedies would materially harm our business and results of operations and impair our ability to market and sell our products and maintain our competitive position. For example, if we are not able to rely on the strength of the Hilton brands to attract prospective members and guests in the marketplace, our revenue and profits would decline and our marketing and sales expenses would increase. If we are not able to use Hilton\u2019s marketing databases and corporate-level advertising channels to reach potential members and guests, including Hilton\u2019s internet address as a channel through which to market available inventory, our member growth would be adversely affected and our revenue would materially decline, and it is uncertain whether we would be able to replace the revenue associated with those channels.\nEven if the license agreement remains in effect, the termination of our rights to use the Hilton Marks (as described above) at properties that fail to meet applicable standards and policies, or any deterioration of quality or reputation of the Hilton brands (even deterioration not leading to termination of our rights under the license agreement or not caused by us), could also harm our reputation and impair our ability to market and sell our products at the subject properties, which could materially harm our business.\nIn addition, if license agreement terms relating to the Hilton Honors\u00ae loyalty program terminate, we would not be able to offer Hilton Honors\u00ae points to our members and guests. This would adversely affect our ability to sell our products, offer the flexibility associated with our Club membership and sustain our collection performance on our timeshare financing receivables portfolio. See \u201cBusiness-Our Business-Key Agreements Related to the Spin-Off-License Agreement.\u201d\nWe will rely on Hilton to consent to our use of its trademarks at new properties we manage in the future.\nUnder the terms of our license agreement with Hilton, we are required to obtain Hilton\u2019s consent to use its trademarks in circumstances specified in the agreement. Hilton may reject a proposed project in certain circumstances. Any requirements to obtain Hilton\u2019s consent to our expansion plans, or the need to identify and secure alternative expansion opportunities because Hilton does not allow us to use its trademarks with proposed new projects, may delay implementation of our expansion plans, cause us to incur additional expense or reduce the financial viability of our projects. Further, if Hilton does not permit us to use its trademarks in connection with our expansion plans, our ability to expand our Hilton-branded timeshare business would cease and our ability to remain competitive may be materially adversely affected.\nOur business depends on the quality and reputation of the Hilton brands and affiliation with the Hilton Honors\u00ae loyalty program.\nCurrently, all of our products and services are offered under the Hilton brand names and affiliated with Hilton\u2019s Honors\u00ae loyalty program, and we intend to continue to develop and offer products and services under the Hilton brands and affiliated with the Hilton Honors\u00ae loyalty program in the future. The concentration of our products and services under these brands and program may expose us to risks of brand or program deterioration, or reputational decline, that are greater than if our portfolio were more diverse. Furthermore, as we are not the owner of the Hilton brands or the Hilton Honors\u00ae loyalty program, changes to these brands and program or our access to them, including our ability to buy points to offer to our members and potential members, could negatively affect our business. Any failure by Hilton to protect the trademarks, tradenames and intellectual\nproperty that we license from it could reduce the value of the Hilton brands and also harm our business. If these brands or program deteriorate or materially change in an adverse manner, or the reputation of these brands or program declines, our market share, reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur dependence on development activities exposes us to project cost and completion risks.\nWe secure VOI inventory in part by developing new timeshare properties and new phases of existing timeshare properties. Our ongoing involvement in the development of inventory presents a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nfuture weakness in the capital markets limiting our ability to raise capital for completion of projects or for development of future properties;\n\u2022\nconstruction costs, to the extent they escalate faster than the pace at which we can increase the price of VOIs, adversely affecting our margins;\n\u2022\nconstruction delays, zoning and other local, state or federal governmental approvals, cost overruns, lender financial defaults, or natural or man-made disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, floods, fires, volcanic eruptions and oil spills, increasing overall project costs, affecting timing of project completion or resulting in project cancellations;\n\u2022\nany liability or alleged liability or resultant delays associated with latent defects in design or construction of projects we have developed or that we construct in the future adversely affecting our business, financial condition and reputation;\n\u2022\nfailure by third-party contractors to perform for any reason, exposing us to operational, reputational and financial harm; and\n\u2022\nthe existence of any title defects in properties we acquire.\nWe also source inventory from third-party developers that are exposed to such risks, and the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our access to the inventory sourced from these developers.\nA decline in developed or acquired VOI inventory or our failure to enter into and maintain fee-for-service agreements may have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nIn addition to VOI supply that we develop or acquire, we source VOIs through fee-for-service agreements with third-party developers. If we fail to develop timeshare properties, acquire inventory or are unsuccessful in entering into new agreements with third-party developers, we may experience a decline in VOI supply, which could result in a decrease in our revenues. Approximately 74 percent of our contract sales were from capital-efficient sources for the year ended December 31, 2016. As part of our strategy to optimize our sales mix of capital-efficient inventory, we will continue to acquire inventory and enter into additional fee-for-service agreements to source inventory. These arrangements may expose us to additional risk as we will not control development activities or timing of development completion. If third parties with whom we enter into agreements are not able to fulfill their obligations to us, the inventory we expect to acquire or market and sell on their behalf may not be available on time or at all, or may not otherwise be within agreed-upon specifications. If our counterparties do not perform as expected and we do not have access to the expected inventory or obtain access to inventory from alternative sources on a timely basis, our ability to achieve sales goals may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, a decline in VOI supply could result in a decrease of financing revenues that are generated by VOI purchases and fee and rental revenues that are generated by our resort and club management services.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe timeshare industry is highly competitive. The Hilton brands we use compete with the timeshare brands affiliated with major hotel chains in national and international venues, as well as more generally with other vacation options such as cruises and the vacation rental options (e.g., hotels, resorts and condominium rentals) generally offered by the lodging and travel industry.\nWe also compete with other timeshare developers for sales of VOIs based principally on location, quality of accommodations, price, service levels and amenities, financing terms, quality of service, terms of property use, reservation systems, flexibility for VOI owners to exchange into time at other timeshare properties or other travel rewards, including access to hotel loyalty programs, as well as brand name recognition and reputation. A number of our competitors are significantly larger with potentially greater access to capital resources and broader marketing, sales and distribution capabilities than we have. We also compete with numerous other smaller owners and operators of timeshare resorts, as well as home and apartment sharing services that market available privately owned residential properties that can be rented on a nightly, weekly or monthly basis. In addition, we compete with national and independent timeshare resale companies and members reselling existing VOIs, which could reduce demand or prices for sales of new VOIs. We also compete with other timeshare management companies in the management of resorts on behalf of owners on the basis of quality, cost, types of services offered and relationship. There is also significant competition for talent at all levels within the industry, in particular for sales and management.\nWe also compete for property acquisitions and partnerships with entities that have similar investment objectives as we do. This competition could limit the number of, or negatively affect the cost of, suitable investment opportunities available to us.\nRecent and potential future consolidation in the highly fragmented timeshare industry may increase competition. Consolidation may create competitors that enjoy significant advantages resulting from, among other things, a lower cost of, and greater access to, capital and enhanced operating efficiencies.\nOur ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain members depends on our success in distinguishing the quality and value of our products and services from those offered by others. If we cannot compete successfully in these areas or if our marketing and sales efforts are not successful and we are unable to convert customers to a sufficient number of sales, this could negatively affect our operating margins and our ability to recover the expense of our marketing programs and grow our business, diminish our market share and reduce our earnings.\nThe sale of VOIs in the secondary market by existing members could cause our sales revenues and profits to decline.\nExisting members have offered, and are expected to continue to offer, their VOIs for sale on the secondary market. The prices at which these intervals are sold are typically less than the prices at which we would sell the intervals. As a result, these sales create additional pricing pressure on our sale of VOIs, which could cause our sales revenues and profits to decline. In addition, if the secondary market for VOIs becomes more organized or financing for such resales becomes more available, our ability to sell VOIs could be adversely affected and/or the resulting availability of VOIs (particularly where the VOIs are available for sale at lower prices than the prices at which we would sell them) could adversely affect our sales revenues. Further, unlawful or deceptive third-party VOI resale or vacation package sales schemes could damage the reputation of the industry, our reputation and brand value or affect our ability to collect management fees, which may adversely affect our sales revenues and results of operations.\nDevelopment of a viable secondary market may also cause the volume of VOI inventory that we are able to repurchase to decline, which could adversely affect our development margin, as we utilize this low-cost inventory source to supplement our inventory needs and help manage our cost of vacation ownership products.\nOur business is regulated under a wide variety of laws, regulations and policies, and failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation, and any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our real estate development activities, for example, are subject to laws and regulations typically applicable to real estate development, subdivision and construction activities, such as laws relating to zoning, entitlement, permitting, land use restrictions, environmental regulation, title transfers, title insurance, taxation and eminent domain. Laws in some jurisdictions also impose liability on property developers for construction defects discovered or repairs made by future owners of property developed by the developer. In addition, the sales of VOIs must be registered with governmental authorities in most jurisdictions in which we do business. The preparation of VOI registrations requires time and cost, and in many jurisdictions the exact date of registration approval cannot be accurately predicted. Various laws also govern our lending activities and our resort management activities, including the laws described in \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation.\u201d\nA number of laws govern our marketing and sales activities, such as timeshare and land sales acts, fair housing statutes, anti-fraud laws, sweepstakes laws, real estate licensing laws, telemarketing laws, home solicitation sales laws, tour operator laws, seller of travel laws, securities laws, consumer privacy laws and consumer protection laws. In addition, laws in many jurisdictions in which we sell VOIs grant the purchaser of a VOI the right to cancel a purchase contract during a specified rescission period.\nIn recent years, telemarketing legislation has significantly increased the costs associated with telemarketing. We have implemented procedures that we believe will help reduce the possibility of violating such laws, but such procedures may not be effective in ensuring regulatory compliance. In March 2016, we reached a settlement with the New York Attorney General relating to charges that we made unsolicited telemarketing calls to New York residents who had signed up for the National Do Not Call Registry. We agreed to pay a settlement in the amount of $250,500 and may continue to place some calls to consumers with whom Hilton already does business, subject to the conditions of the settlement. However, because our relationship with Hilton has changed, it may be more difficult for us to utilize customer information we obtain from Hilton in the future for marketing purposes.\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Accessibility Guidelines promulgated thereunder, which we refer to collectively as the ADA, all public accommodations must meet various federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with ADA\u2019s requirements could require removal of access barriers, and non-compliance could result in the U.S. government imposing fines or in private litigants winning damages. Our properties also are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. Furthermore, various laws govern our resort management activities, including laws and regulations regarding community association management, public lodging, food and beverage services, liquor licensing, labor, employment, health care, health and safety, accessibility, discrimination, immigration, gaming and the environment (including climate change).\nOur lending activities are also subject to a number of laws and regulations, including laws and regulations related to consumer loans, retail installment contracts, mortgage lending, fair debt collection and credit reporting practices, consumer collection practices, contacting debtors by telephone, mortgage disclosure, lender licenses and money laundering.\nWe may not be successful in maintaining compliance with all laws, regulations and policies to which we are currently subject, and such compliance could be expensive and time consuming. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements would require significant unanticipated expenditures that would affect our cash flow and results of operations. Failure to comply with current or future applicable laws, regulations and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, if we do not comply with applicable laws, regulations and policies, governmental authorities in the jurisdictions where the violations occurred may revoke or refuse to renew licenses or registrations we must have to operate our business. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and policies could also render sales contracts for our products void or voidable, subject us to fines or other sanctions and increase our exposure to litigation.\nWe may experience financial and operational risks in connection with acquisitions and other opportunistic business ventures.\nWe will consider strategic acquisitions to expand our inventory options and distribution capabilities; however, we may be unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or complete transactions on favorable terms. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and/or the assumption of contingent liabilities. These acquisitions may also be structured in such a way that we will be assuming unknown or undisclosed liabilities or obligations. Moreover, we may be unable to efficiently integrate acquisitions, management attention and other resources may be diverted away from other potentially more profitable areas of our business and in some cases these acquisitions may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we also intend to continue collaborating with Hilton on timeshare development opportunities at new and existing hotel properties and explore growth opportunities along the Hilton brand spectrum, as well as expand our marketing partnerships and travel exchange partners. However, we may be unable to successfully enter into these arrangements on favorable terms or launch related products and services, or such products and services may not gain acceptance among our members or be profitable. The failure to develop and execute any such initiatives on a cost-effective basis could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our ability to engage in acquisitions may be limited by restrictions on our ability to raise additional equity capital. See \u201cBusiness-Our Business-Key Agreements Related to the Spin-Off-Tax Matters Agreement,\u201d \u201cBusiness-Our Business-Key Agreements Related to the Spin-Off -Blackstone Stockholders Agreement,\u201d and \u201cBusiness-Our Business-Key Agreements Related to the Spin-Off-HNA Stockholders Agreement.\u201d\nDisagreements with VOI owners, HOAs and other third parties may result in litigation and/or loss of management contracts.\nThe nature of our responsibilities in managing timeshare properties may from time to time give rise to disagreements with VOI owners and HOAs. To develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential owners and HOAs, we seek to resolve any disagreements but may not always be able to do so. Failure to resolve such disagreements may result in litigation. Further, disagreements with HOAs could also result in the loss of management contracts, a significant loss of which could negatively affect our profits or limit our ability to operate our business, and our ongoing ability to generate sales from our existing member base may be adversely affected.\nIn the normal course of our business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and in the future we could become the subject of claims by current or former members, persons to whom we market our products, third-party developers, guests who use our properties, our employees or contractors, our investors or regulators. The outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted. If any such litigation results in a significant adverse judgment, settlement or court order, we could suffer significant losses, our profits could be reduced, our reputation could be harmed and our future ability to operate our business could be constrained.\nWe manage a concentration of properties in particular geographic areas, which exposes our business to the effects of regional events and occurrences.\nA significant number, approximately 81 percent, of the resorts we manage are concentrated in Florida, Hawaii, Nevada, New York and South Carolina and are, therefore, particularly susceptible to adverse economic developments in those areas. These economic developments include regional economic downturns, significant increases in the number of our competitors\u2019 products in these markets and potentially higher labor, real estate, tax or other costs in the geographic markets in which we are concentrated. In addition, the properties we manage are subject to the effects of adverse acts of natural or manmade disasters, including earthquakes, windstorms,\ntornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, floods, drought, fires, oil spills and nuclear incidents. Depending on the severity of these disasters, the damage could require closure of all or substantially all of these properties in one or more markets for a period of time while the necessary repairs and renovations, as applicable, are undertaken. In addition, we cannot guarantee that the amount of insurance maintained for these properties from time to time would entirely cover damages caused by any such event.\nFear of exposure to pandemic or contagious diseases, such as Ebola, avian flu, SARs, swine flu and the Zika virus, or natural or manmade disasters, may also deter travelers from scheduling vacations or cause them to cancel vacation plans to the markets in which the properties we manage are concentrated. Actual or threatened war, political conditions or civil unrest, violence or terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events, could also interrupt or deter vacation plans to our key markets.\nAs a result of this geographic concentration of properties, we face a greater risk of a negative effect on our revenues in the event these areas are more severely affected by adverse economic and competitive conditions, extreme weather, manmade disasters or pandemic or contagious diseases.\nOur current operations and future expansion outside of the United States make us susceptible to the risks of doing business internationally, which could lower our revenues, increase our costs, reduce our profits or disrupt our business.\nWe currently offer timeshare properties located in the United States, the United Kingdom and Italy. We also market both our international and U.S. properties in Europe and the Asia Pacific region, primarily in Japan and South Korea. In addition, as part of our business strategy, we intend to continue the expansion of our operations in Japan as well as explore further expansion opportunities in other countries located in Asia. Such activities may not be limited only to marketing efforts for existing international and U.S. properties in other countries but also include acquiring, developing, managing, marketing, offering and/or financing timeshare properties in such countries. Such current and future international operations expose us to a number of additional challenges and risks that may not be inherent in operating just in the U.S., including, for example, the following:\n\u2022\nrapid changes in governmental, economic or political policy;\n\u2022\npolitical or civil unrest, acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation;\n\u2022\nnegative impact on governmental relationships between those countries in which we currently operate or have future expansion plans, on one hand, and the U.S., on the other hand, which may result in undesirable trade, travel or similar regulations, thereby negatively affecting the tourism industry generally, and the timeshare and leisure industry specifically;\n\u2022\nincreases in anti-American sentiment and the identification of the Hilton brands as American brands;\n\u2022\nrecessionary trends or economic instability in international markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates or currency restructurings and hyperinflation or deflation in the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nthe effect of disruptions caused by severe weather, natural disasters, outbreak of disease or other events that make travel to a particular region less attractive or more difficult;\n\u2022\nthe presence and acceptance of varying levels of business corruption in international markets and the effect of various anti-corruption and other laws;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds or limitations on our ability to repatriate non-U.S. earnings in a tax-efficient manner;\n\u2022\nthe ability to comply with or effect of complying with complex and changing laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments that may affect investments or operations, including foreign ownership restrictions, import and export controls, tariffs, embargoes, increases in taxes paid and other changes in applicable tax laws;\n\u2022\nuncertain, unfamiliar and/or unpredictable regulatory environment that may adversely affect the acquisition, development, management, marketing, sales, financings, and related activities that affect the lodging, real estate, and travel industries, and, more specifically, to the timeshare industry, such as zoning laws, real estate development regulations, and consumer privacy;\n\u2022\nuncertainties as to local laws regarding, and enforcement of, contract and intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nforced nationalization of resort properties by local, state or national governments;\n\u2022\ndifferent social or cultural norms and practices that are not customary in the U.S.; and\n\u2022\nthe difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in different countries.\nThese and other factors may materially, adversely affect our business generally, future expansion plans, revenues from international operations, costs and profits, as well as our financial condition, Moreover, our experience operating internationally is limited to certain markets, which may result in greater inefficiencies in navigating the risks of operating internationally should we expand our international operations into other countries and territories, and could result in greater effects on our business than would be experienced by a company with greater international experience.\nFurther, instability of the Eurozone, including fears of sovereign debt defaults, and stagnant growth generally, and of certain Eurozone member states in particular, have resulted in concerns regarding the suitability of a shared currency for the region, which could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies for member states. If this were to occur, certain of our Euro-denominated assets and liabilities would be re-denominated to such individual currencies, which could result in a mismatch in the values of assets and liabilities and expose us and certain of our investments to additional currency risks. Even if the Euro is maintained, continued concerns regarding the stability of the Eurozone, including potential consequences following Brexit, and the potential effects of government intervention intended to address it could materially adversely affect our business. Similarly, we market our products in Japan, and the Japanese economy has experienced periods of fiscal and economic volatility recently. We may be unable to properly predict the effect of such volatility, including the actions that may be taken by the Japanese government, in a way that fully mitigates the impact of such volatility on our marketing activities and businesses in Japan.\nOur insurance policies may not cover all potential losses.\nWe maintain insurance coverage for liability, property, business interruption and other risks with respect to business operations. While we have comprehensive property and liability insurance policies with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary, market forces beyond our control may limit the scope of the insurance coverage we can obtain or our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates. The cost of our insurance may increase and our coverage levels may decrease, which may affect our ability to maintain customary insurance coverage and deductibles at acceptable costs. There is a limit as well as various sub-limits on the amount of insurance proceeds we will receive in excess of applicable deductibles. If an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of our properties, the claims from each affected property may be considered together per policy provisions to determine whether the per occurrence limit, annual aggregate limit or sub-limits, depending on the type of claim, have been reached. If the limits or sub-limits are exceeded, each affected property may only receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy. Further, certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, terrorist acts, such as biological or chemical terrorism, political risks, some environmental hazards and/or natural or manmade disasters, may be outside the general coverage limits of our policy, subject to large deductibles, deemed uninsurable or too cost-prohibitive to justify insuring against. In addition, in the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of the affected resort or in some cases may not provide a recovery for any part of a loss. As a result, we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future marketing, sales or revenue opportunities from the property. Further, we could remain obligated under guarantees or other financial obligations related to the property despite the loss of product inventory, and our members could be required to contribute toward deductibles to help cover losses.\nFailure of HOA boards to levy sufficient fees, or the failure of members to pay those fees, could lead to inadequate funds to maintain or improve the properties we manage.\nOwners of our VOIs and those we sell on behalf of third-party developers must pay maintenance fees levied by HOA boards, which include reserve amounts for capital replacements and refurbishments. These maintenance fees are used to maintain and refurbish the timeshare properties and to keep the properties in compliance with applicable Hilton standards and policies. If HOA boards do not levy sufficient maintenance fees, including capital reserves required by applicable law, or manage their reserves appropriately, or if members do not pay their maintenance fees, the timeshare properties could fall into disrepair and fail to comply with applicable standards and policies and/or state regulators could impose requirements, obligations and penalties. A decline in the quality or standards of the resorts we manage would negatively affect our ability to attract new members and maintain member satisfaction. In addition, if a resort fails to comply with applicable standards and policies because maintenance fees are not paid or otherwise, Hilton could terminate our rights under the license agreement to use its trademarks at the non-compliant resort, which could result in the loss of management fees, and could decrease member satisfaction and impair our ability to market and sell our products at the non-compliant locations.\nIf maintenance fees at our resorts are required to be increased, our product could become less attractive and our business could be harmed.\nThe maintenance fees that are levied by HOA boards on VOI owners may increase as the costs to maintain and refurbish the timeshare properties and to keep the properties in compliance with Hilton brand standards increase. Increased maintenance fees could make our products less desirable, which could have a negative effect on VOI sales. Further, if our maintenance fees increase substantially year over year or are not competitive with other VOI providers, we may not be able to attract new members or retain existing members.\nIf purchasers default on the loans that we provide to finance their VOI purchases, our revenues, cash flows and profits could be reduced.\nProviding secured financing to some purchasers of VOIs subjects us to the risk of purchaser default. As of December 31, 2016, our consumer loan portfolio had a balance of approximately $1.15 billion and experienced default rates of 3.67 percent, 2.84 percent, and 3.22 percent for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. If a purchaser defaults under the financing that we provide, we could be forced to write off the loan and reclaim ownership of the VOI. We may be unable to resell the property in a timely manner or at the same price, or at all. Also, if a purchaser of a VOI defaults on the related loan during the early part of the amortization period, we may not have recovered the marketing, selling and general and administrative costs associated with the sale of that VOI. If we are unable to recover any of the principal amount of the loan from a defaulting purchaser, or if the allowances for losses from such defaults are inadequate, our revenues and profits could be reduced.\nIf default rates increase beyond current projections and result in higher than expected foreclosure activity, our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, the transactions in which we have securitized timeshare financing receivables in the capital markets contain certain portfolio performance requirements related to default, delinquency and recovery rates, which, if not met, would result in loss or disruption of cash flow until portfolio performance sufficiently improves to satisfy the requirements. In addition, we may not be able to resell foreclosed intervals in a timely manner or for an attractive price.\nIf the default rates or other credit metrics underlying our timeshare financing receivables deteriorate, our timeshare financing receivable securitization program could be adversely affected.\nOur timeshare financing receivable securitization program could be adversely affected if a particular timeshare financing receivables pool fails to meet certain performance ratios, which could occur if the default rate or other credit metrics of the underlying timeshare financing receivables deteriorate. In addition, if we offer timeshare financings to our customers with terms longer than those generally offered in the industry, we may not\nbe able to securitize those timeshare financing receivables. Our ability to sell securities backed by our timeshare financing receivables depends on the continued ability and willingness of capital market participants to invest in such securities. Asset-backed securities issued in our timeshare financing receivable securitization program could be downgraded by credit agencies in the future. If a downgrade occurs, our ability to complete other securitization transactions on acceptable terms or at all could be jeopardized, and we could be forced to rely on other potentially more expensive and less attractive funding sources, to the extent available. Similarly, if other operators of vacation ownership products were to experience significant financial difficulties, or if the timeshare industry as a whole were to contract, we could experience difficulty in securing funding on acceptable terms. The occurrence of any of the foregoing would decrease our profitability and might require us to adjust our business operations, including by reducing or suspending our provision of financing to purchasers of VOIs. Sales of VOIs may decline if we reduce or suspend the provision of financing to purchasers, which may adversely affect our cash flows, revenues and profits.\nA failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations, competitive position or reputation.\nOur business model and competitive conditions in the timeshare industry demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems, including those used for our marketing, sales, reservation, inventory management and property management systems, and technologies we make available to our members and more generally to support our business. We must refine, update and/or replace these technologies and systems with more advanced systems on a regular basis. If we cannot do so as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time frames, our business could suffer. We also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system, and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could harm our operating results.\nIn addition, the proliferation and global reach of social media continues to expand rapidly and could cause us to suffer reputational harm. The continuing evolution of social media presents new challenges and requires us to keep pace with new developments, technology and trends. Negative posts or comments about us, the properties we manage or the Hilton brands we use on any social networking or user-generated review website, including travel and/or vacation property websites, could affect consumer opinions of us and our products, and we cannot guarantee that we will timely or adequately redress such instances.\nFailure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in faulty business decisions or operational inefficiencies, damage our reputation and/or subject us to costs, fines or lawsuits.\nWe collect and retain large volumes of customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information in various information systems and those of our service providers. We also maintain personally identifiable information of our employees. The integrity and protection of this customer and employee data is critical to us. We could make faulty decisions if that data is inaccurate or incomplete. Customers and employees also have a high expectation that we and our service providers will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment surrounding information, security and privacy is also increasingly demanding, in both the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate.\nOur systems may be unable to satisfy changing regulatory requirements and customer and employee expectations, or may require significant additional investments or time to do so. We depend upon the secure transmission of information over public networks. Our information systems and records, including those we maintain with our service providers, may be subject to security breaches, unauthorized access by hackers, cyber-attacks, which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, system failures, viruses, operator error or malfeasance or inadvertent releases of data. For instance, security breaches could result in the dissemination of member and guest credit card information, which could lead to affected members and guests experiencing fraudulent charges. In some cases it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused thereby. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, employee or company data maintained by us or by a service provider could adversely affect our reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses, fines or litigation.\nA breach in the security of our information systems or those of our service providers could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems, potentially resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits.\nChanges in privacy law could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively.\nWe rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including telemarketing, email and social media marketing and postal mailings, and we are subject to various laws and regulations in the United States and internationally that govern marketing and advertising practices. Adoption of new state or federal laws regulating marketing and solicitation, or international data protection laws that govern these activities, or changes to existing laws, such as the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, could adversely affect current or planned marketing activities and cause us to change our marketing strategy. If this occurs, we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies, which could affect the amount and timing of our VOI sales. We also obtain access to potential members and guests from travel service providers or other companies, including Hilton, and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or through other companies\u2019 marketing materials. If access to these lists were prohibited or otherwise restricted, including access to Hilton Honors\u00ae loyalty program member information, our ability to access potential members and guests and introduce them to our products could be significantly impaired. Additionally, because our relationship with Hilton has changed, it may be more difficult for us to utilize customer information we obtain from Hilton in the future.\nThe growth of our business and the execution of our business strategies depend on the services of our management team and our employees.\nWe believe that our future growth depends, in part, on the continued services of our management team and our ability to attract and retain key officers and other highly qualified personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining and attracting management and other highly qualified personnel. The loss of any members of our management team could adversely affect our strategic, member and guest relationships and impede our ability to execute our business strategies.\nIn addition, insufficient numbers of talented employees at our properties could constrain our ability to maintain our current levels of business, or expand our business. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel across a diverse array of operating disciplines. If we cannot recruit, train, develop or retain sufficient numbers of talented employees, we could experience increased employee turnover, decreased member and guest satisfaction, low morale, inefficiency or internal control failures, which could materially reduce our profits.\nThird-party reservation channels may negatively affect our bookings for room rental revenues.\nSome stays at the properties we manage are booked through third-party internet travel intermediaries, such as expedia.com, orbitz.com and booking.com, as well as lesser-known and/or newly emerging online travel service providers. As the percentage of internet bookings increases, these intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions, reduced room rates or other significant contract concessions from us. Moreover, some of these internet travel intermediaries are attempting to commoditize lodging by increasing the importance of price and general indicators of quality (such as \u201cthree-star property\u201d) at the expense of brand identification. These intermediaries also generally employ aggressive marketing strategies, including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites. Additionally, consumers can book stays at the properties we manage through other distribution channels, including travel agents, travel membership associations and meeting procurement firms. Over time, consumers may develop loyalties to these third-party reservation systems rather than to our booking channels. Although we expect to derive most of our business from traditional channels and our websites (and those of Hilton), our business and profitability could be adversely affected if customer loyalties change significantly, diverting bookings away from our distribution channels.\nOur real estate investments subject us to numerous risks.\nWe are subject to the risks that generally relate to investments in, and development of, real property. A variety of factors affect income from properties and real estate values, including laws and regulations, insurance, interest rate levels and the availability of financing. Our license agreement, or other agreements, with Hilton may require us to incur unexpected costs required to cause our properties to comply with applicable standards and policies. When interest rates increase, the cost of acquiring, developing, expanding or renovating real property increases and real property values may decrease as the number of potential buyers decrease, and in recent years our financial results have benefited from low interest rates. Similarly, as financing becomes less available, it becomes more difficult both to acquire and develop real property. Many costs of real estate investments, such as real estate taxes, insurance premiums, maintenance costs and certain operating costs, are generally more fixed than variable and as a result are not reduced even when a property is not fully sold or occupied. If any of these risks were realized, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nU.S. or foreign environmental laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to potential liabilities.\nWe are subject to certain compliance costs and potential liabilities under various U.S. federal, state and local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions, the use, storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances, and wastewater disposal. Our failure to comply with such laws, including any required permits or licenses, could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations. We could also be liable under such laws for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at our currently or formerly owned real property or at third-party locations in connection with our waste disposal operations, regardless of whether or not we knew of, or caused, the presence or release of such substances. From time to time, we may be required to remediate such substances or remove, abate or manage asbestos, mold, radon gas, lead or other hazardous conditions at our properties. The presence or release of such toxic or hazardous substances could result in third-party claims for personal injury, property or natural resource damages, business interruption or other losses. Such claims and the need to investigate, remediate or otherwise address hazardous, toxic or unsafe conditions could adversely affect our operations, the value of any affected real property, or our ability to sell, lease or assign our rights in any such property, or could otherwise harm our business or reputation. Environmental, health and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent, and our costs may increase as a result.\nThe U.S. Congress, some U.S. states and various countries are considering or have undertaken actions to regulate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. New or revised laws and regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, such as those related to climate change, could affect the operation of the properties we manage or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on us. The cost of such legislation, regulation or new interpretations would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this time.\nOur ability to source VOI inventory and finance VOI sales may be impaired if we or the third-party developers with whom we do business are unable to access capital when necessary.\nThe availability of funds for new investments, primarily developing, acquiring or repurchasing VOI inventory, depends in part on liquidity factors and capital markets over which we can exert little, if any, control. Instability in the financial markets and any resulting contraction of available liquidity and leverage could constrain the capital markets for investments in timeshare products. In addition, we intend to access the securitization markets to securitize our timeshare financing receivables. Any future deterioration in the financial markets could preclude, delay or increase the cost to us of future securitizations. We also require the issuance of surety bonds in connection with our real estate development and VOI sales activity. The availability, terms and conditions and pricing of our bonding capacity is dependent on, among other things, continued financial strength and stability of the insurance company affiliates providing the bonding capacity, general availability of such\ncapacity and our corporate credit rating. If bonding capacity is unavailable, or alternatively, if the terms and conditions and pricing of such bonding capacity are unacceptable to us, our business could be negatively affected. Instability in the financial markets could also affect the timing and volume of any securitizations we undertake, as well as the financial terms of such securitizations. Any indebtedness we incur, including indebtedness under these facilities, may adversely affect our ability to obtain any additional financing necessary to develop or acquire additional VOI inventory or make other investments in our business, or to repurchase VOIs on the secondary market. Furthermore, volatility in the financial markets, due to tightening of underwriting standards by lenders and credit rating agencies, among other things, could result in less availability of credit and increased costs for what is available, and we may find it difficult, costly or impossible to obtain financing on attractive terms. If the overall cost of borrowing increases, either by increases in the index rates or by increases in lender spreads, the increased costs would likely reduce future cash flow available for distribution, affecting our growth and development plans.\nWe have and will continue to enter into fee-for-service agreements with third-party developers to source inventory. These agreements enable us to generate fees from the marketing and sales services we provide, Club memberships and from the management of the timeshare properties without requiring us to fund acquisition and construction costs. If these developers are not able to obtain or maintain financing necessary for their operations, we may not be able to enter into these arrangements, which would limit opportunities for growth and reduce our revenues.\nChanges to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations.\nNew accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future. A change in accounting rules or regulations may require retrospective application and affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective, and future changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of accounting standards issued but not yet adopted.\nChanges to estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of our assets, or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain locations, may cause us to incur impairment losses that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur total assets include intangible assets with finite useful lives and long-lived assets, principally property and equipment and VOI inventory. We evaluate our intangible assets with finite useful lives and long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Our evaluation of impairment requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions including projections of future results. After performing our evaluation for impairment, including an analysis to determine the recoverability of long-lived assets, we will record an impairment loss when the carrying value of the underlying asset, asset group or reporting unit exceeds its fair value. We carry our VOI inventory at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, less costs to sell. If the estimates or assumptions used in our evaluation of impairment or fair value change, we may be required to record impairment losses on certain of these assets. If these impairment losses are significant, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nChanges in U.S. federal, state and local or foreign tax law, interpretations of existing tax law, or adverse determinations by tax authorities, could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation at the federal, state and local levels in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes, changes\nin the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax. From time to time, the U.S. federal, state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Changes in the non-income tax rates to which we are subject could also have an adverse effect on the maintenance fees charged to our members, which could result in materially lower sales and higher operating costs.\nWe are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in U.S. federal and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. An unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs, penalties and interest, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe expiration, termination or renegotiation of our management agreements could adversely affect our cash flows, revenues and profits.\nWe enter into management agreements with the HOAs of the VOI owners for the timeshare resorts developed by us or by third parties with whom we have entered into fee-for-service agreements. Our management agreements generally provide for a cost-plus management fee equal to 10 percent to 15 percent of the costs to operate the applicable resort. We also receive revenues that represent reimbursement for the costs incurred to perform our services, principally related to personnel providing on-site services. The original term of our management agreements is typically governed by state timeshare laws and ranges from three to five years, and many of these agreements renew automatically for one- to three-year periods unless either party provides advance notice of termination before the expiration of the term. Although none of the management agreements relating to our developed or fee-for-service properties have been terminated or lapsed since our inception, any of these agreements may expire at the end of its then-current term (following notice by a party of non-renewal) or be terminated, or the contract terms may be renegotiated in a manner adverse to us. If a management agreement is terminated or not renewed on favorable terms, our cash flows, revenues and profits could be adversely affected.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations may increase costs, reduce profits, limit growth or subject us to broader liability.\nOur business operations in countries outside the United States are subject to a number of laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), as well as trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d). The FCPA is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions. OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states, organizations and individuals. Although we have policies in place designed to comply with applicable sanctions, rules and regulations, it is possible that the timeshare properties we own or manage in the countries and territories in which we operate may provide services to or receive funds from persons subject to sanctions. In addition, some of our operations may be subject to the laws and regulations of non-U.S. jurisdictions, including the U.K.\u2019s Bribery Act 2010, which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities, and other local anti-corruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations.\nIf we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be exposed to claims for damages, financial penalties, reputational harm and incarceration of employees or restrictions on our operation or ownership of timeshare and other properties, including the termination of ownership and management rights. In addition, in certain circumstances, the actions of parties affiliated with us (including Hilton, third-party developers, and our and their respective employees and agents) may expose us to liability under the FCPA, U.S. sanctions or other laws. These restrictions could increase costs of operations, reduce profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities that would otherwise support growth.\nIn August 2012, Congress enacted the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (\u201cITRSHRA\u201d), which expands the scope of U.S. sanctions against Iran and Syria. In particular, Section 219 of the ITRSHRA amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), to require SEC-reporting companies to disclose in their periodic reports specified dealings or transactions involving Iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain OFAC sanctions engaged in by the reporting company or any of its affiliates. These companies are required to separately file with the SEC a notice that such activities have been disclosed in the relevant periodic report, and the SEC is required to post this notice of disclosure on its website and send the report to the U.S. President and certain U.S. Congressional committees. The U.S. President thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and, within 180 days of initiating such an investigation with respect to certain disclosed activities, to determine whether sanctions should be imposed.\nUnder ITRSHRA, we are required to report if we or any of our \u201caffiliates\u201d knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during a period covered by one of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K or Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. We may engage in activities that would require disclosure pursuant to Section 219 of ITRSHRA. In addition, because the SEC defines the term \u201caffiliate\u201d broadly, it includes any entity controlled by us as well as any person or entity that controls us or is under common control with us. Because we may be deemed to be a controlled affiliate of Blackstone, affiliates of Blackstone may also be considered our affiliates. Hilton and other affiliates of Blackstone have in the past and may in the future be required to make disclosures pursuant to ITRSHRA, including the activities discussed in the disclosures included on Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which disclosures are hereby incorporated by reference herein. Disclosure of such activities, even if such activities are permissible under applicable law, and any sanctions imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities could harm our reputation and the Hilton brands we use and have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, our ability to operate our business, our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our total indebtedness was approximately $1.18 billion. Our substantial debt and other contractual obligations could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, dividends to stockholders and to pursue future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u2022\nexposing us to increased interest expense, as our degree of leverage may cause the interest rates of any future indebtedness (whether fixed or floating rate interest) to be higher than they would be otherwise;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our indebtedness is at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default that accelerates our obligation to repay indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, satisfaction of debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be better positioned to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.\nFor additional discussion on our indebtedness, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Financing Activities\u201d and Note 10: Debt in our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCertain of our debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities.\nThe debt agreements that govern our outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions may limit our ability and/or the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends (including to us) and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nincur certain liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to us;\n\u2022\ndesignate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\ntransfer or sell assets.\nIn addition, our credit agreement related to our senior secured credit facilities contains certain affirmative covenants that will require us to be in compliance with certain leverage and financial ratios.\nAs a result of these restrictions, we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any other future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, we may not be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.\nOur failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above, as well as other terms of our other indebtedness and/or the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time, could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or are unable to refinance these borrowings, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nServicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are not within our control.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness, to fund planned capital expenditures and to pay dividends to our stockholders will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. To a certain extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In particular, compliance with state and local laws applicable to our business, including those relating to deeds, title transfers and certain other regulations applicable to sales of VOIs, may at times delay or hinder our ability to access cash flows generated by our VOI sales. If we are unable to generate and access sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments, we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital. We may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and these actions\nmay not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives. Finally, our ability to raise additional equity capital may be restricted because the issuance of our stock may cause the spin-off to be a taxable event for Hilton under Section 355(e) of the Code, and under the Tax Matters Agreement, we could be required to indemnify Hilton or Park for that tax and certain covenants may restrict issuances of our stock during the two-year period following the spin-off. See \u201cBusiness-Our Business-Key Agreements Related to the Spin-Off -Tax Matters Agreement.\u201d\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions, which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.\nWe may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness, including secured debt, in the future. Although the agreements that govern substantially all of our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and entering into certain types of other transactions, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions. Additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations, such as trade payables, that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments. To the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described in the preceding three risk factors would increase.\nRisks Related to the Recent Spin-Off\nWe may be responsible for U.S. federal income tax liabilities that relate to the distribution.\nThe completion of the spin-off was conditioned upon the absence of any withdrawal, invalidation or modification of the ruling (\u201cIRS Ruling\u201d) Hilton received from the IRS regarding certain U.S. federal income tax aspects of the spin-off in an adverse manner prior to the effective time of the spin-off. Although the IRS Ruling generally is binding on the IRS, the continued validity of the IRS Ruling is based upon and subject to the accuracy of factual statements and representations made to the IRS by Hilton.\nIn addition, the spin-off was conditioned on the receipt of an opinion of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, Hilton\u2019s tax counsel (\u201cspin-off Tax Counsel\u201d) to the effect that the distributions of our and Park common stock would qualify as tax-free distributions under Section 355 of the Code. An opinion of spin-off Tax Counsel is not binding on the IRS. Accordingly, the IRS may reach conclusions with respect to the spin-off that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion. The opinion was based on certain factual statements and representations, which, if incomplete or untrue in any material respect, could alter spin-off Tax Counsel\u2019s conclusions.\nWe are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause any such factual statements or representations in the IRS Ruling or the opinion of spin-off Tax Counsel to be incomplete or untrue or cause the facts on which the IRS Ruling and legal opinion are based to be materially different from the facts at the time of the spin-off.\nIf all or a portion of the spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free transaction for any reason, including because any of the factual statements or representations in the IRS Ruling or the legal opinion are incomplete or untrue, because the facts upon which the IRS Ruling is based are materially different from the facts at the time of the spin-off or because one or more sales of our common stock, Hilton common stock or Park common stock by our respective stockholders, including Blackstone, after the spin-off cause the spin-off not to qualify as a tax-free transaction, Hilton may recognize a substantial gain attributable to the timeshare business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, under U.S. Treasury regulations, each member of the Hilton consolidated group at the time of the spin-off (including us and our subsidiaries) would be jointly and severally liable for the resulting entire amount of any U.S. federal income tax liability. Additionally, if the distribution of our common stock and/or the distribution of Park common stock do not qualify as tax-free under Section 355 of the Code, Hilton stockholders will be treated as having received a taxable dividend to the extent of Hilton\u2019s current and\naccumulated earnings and profits and then would have a tax-free basis recovery up to the amount of their tax basis in their shares and then would have taxable gain from the sale or exchange of the shares to the extent of any excess.\nEven if the spin-off otherwise qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the distribution will be taxable to Park and/or Hilton (but not to Hilton stockholders) pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Code if there are (or have been) one or more acquisitions (including issuances) of our stock, the stock of Park or the stock of Hilton, representing 50 percent or more, measured by vote or value, of the stock of any such corporation and the acquisition or acquisitions are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution. Any acquisition of our common stock within two years before or after the distribution (with exceptions, including public trading by less-than-5 percent stockholders and certain compensatory stock issuances) generally will be presumed to be part of such a plan unless that presumption is rebutted. The resulting tax liability would be substantial, and under U.S. Treasury regulations, each member of the Hilton consolidated group at the time of the spin-off (including us and our subsidiaries) would be jointly and severally liable for the resulting U.S. federal income tax liability.\nWe have agreed not to enter into certain transactions that could cause any portion of the spin-off to be taxable to Hilton, including under Section 355(e) of the Code. Pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, we have also agreed to indemnify Hilton and Park for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions or other actions we take, and Hilton and Park have agreed to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from transactions entered into by Hilton or Park. These obligations may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company. For additional detail, see \u201cBusiness-Our Business-Key Agreements Related to the Spin-Off -Tax Matters Agreement.\u201d\nWe may be unable to take certain actions because such actions could jeopardize the tax-free status of the spin-off, and such restrictions could be significant.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment of the spin-off, for the initial two-year period following the spin-off, we are prohibited, except in limited circumstances, from taking or failing to take certain actions that would prevent the spin-off and related transactions from being tax-free, including: (1) entering into any transaction pursuant to which our stock would be acquired, whether by merger or otherwise; (2) issuing any equity securities or securities that could possibly be converted into our equity securities; or (3) repurchasing our equity securities.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability to issue equity and to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business. In addition, if we take, or fail to take, actions that prevent the spin-off and related transactions from being tax-free, we could be liable for the adverse tax consequences resulting from such actions. For a more detailed description, see \u201cBusiness-Our Business-Key Agreements Related to the Spin-Off-Tax Matters Agreement\u201d and \u201cBusiness-Our Business-Key Agreements Related to the Spin-Off-Tax Stockholders Agreement.\u201d\nThe spin-off and related transactions may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.\nThe spin-off could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. An unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor (such as a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy) could claim that Hilton did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the spin-off, and that the spin-off left Hilton insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that Hilton intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. If a court were to agree with such a plaintiff, then such court could void the spin-off as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies, including without limitation, returning our assets or your shares in our company to Hilton or providing Hilton with a claim for money damages against us in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by Hilton and the fair market value of our company at the time of the spin-off.\nThe measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws may vary depending on which jurisdiction\u2019s law is applied. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if the fair saleable\nvalue of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (including the probable amount of contingent liabilities), and such entity would be considered to have unreasonably small capital if it lacked adequate capital to conduct its business in the ordinary course and pay its liabilities as they become due. No assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that Hilton were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the spin-off, including the distribution of our common stock.\nWe could be required to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to Hilton or Park under the Distribution Agreement.\nUnder the Distribution Agreement and related ancillary agreements, each of us, Hilton and Park are generally responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which they own and operate following the spin-off. Although we do not expect to be liable for any obligations that were not allocated to us under the Distribution Agreement, a court could disregard the allocation agreed to among the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to Hilton or Park (for example, tax and/or environmental liabilities), particularly if Hilton or Park were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the allocated obligations. See \u201cBusiness-Our Business-Key Agreements Related to the Spin-Off -Distribution Agreement.\u201d\nIn addition, losses in respect of certain shared contingent liabilities, which generally are not specifically attributable to any of the timeshare business, the Park business or the retained business of Hilton, were determined on or prior to the date on which the Distribution Agreement was entered (\u201cShared Contingent Liabilities\u201d). The percentage of Shared Contingent Liabilities for which we are responsible has been fixed in a manner that is intended to approximate our estimated enterprise value on the distribution date relative to the estimated enterprise values of Park and Hilton. Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, Hilton is generally vested with the exclusive management and control of all matters pertaining to any such Shared Contingent Liabilities, including the prosecution of any claim and the conduct of any defense. See \u201cBusiness-Our Business-Key Agreements Related to the Spin-Off -Distribution Agreement.\u201d\nWe do not have a recent operating history as an independent company and our historical financial information does not predict our future results.\nThe historical financial information we have included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been derived from the consolidated financial statements of Hilton and does not necessarily reflect what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been as a separate, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. Hilton did not account for us, and we were not operated, as a single stand-alone entity for the periods presented. The costs and expenses reflected in our historical financial statements include an allocation for certain corporate functions historically provided by Hilton. These allocations were based on what we and Hilton considered to be reasonable reflections of the historical utilization levels of these services required in support of our business. The historical information does not necessarily indicate what our results of operations, financial position, cash flows or costs and expenses will be in the future. For additional information, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d \u201cSelected Historical Consolidated Financial Data,\u201d and the notes to those statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may incur greater costs as an independent company than we did when we were part of Hilton.\nAs part of Hilton, we were able to advantage of its size and purchasing power in procuring certain goods and services such as insurance and health care benefits, and technology such as computer software licenses. We were also able to rely on Hilton to provide various corporate functions. As a separate, independent entity as a result of the spin-off, we may be unable to obtain these goods, services and technologies at prices or on terms as favorable to us as those we obtained prior to the distribution. We may also incur costs for functions previously performed by Hilton that are higher than the amounts reflected in our historical financial statements, which could cause our profitability to decrease.\nOur ability to meet our capital needs may be harmed by the loss of financial support from Hilton.\nThe loss of financial support from Hilton could harm our ability to meet our capital needs. Hilton can currently provide certain capital that may be needed in excess of the amounts generated by our operating activities and historically has provided financing to us at rates that we believe are not representative of the cost of financing that we will incur as a stand-alone company. We expect to obtain any funds needed in excess of the amounts generated by our operating activities through the capital markets or bank financing, and not from Hilton. However, given the smaller relative size of our company, as compared to Hilton, we may incur higher debt servicing and other costs relating to new indebtedness than we would have otherwise incurred as a part of Hilton. As a stand-alone company, the cost of our financing also will depend on other factors such as our performance and financial market conditions generally. Further, we cannot guarantee you that we will be able to obtain capital market financing or credit on favorable terms, or at all, in the future. We cannot assure you that our ability to meet our capital needs, including servicing our own debt, will not be harmed by the loss of financial support from Hilton.\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spin-off.\nWe believe that the spin-off will enhance our long-term value. However, as a result of our separation from Hilton, we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than we would have been were we still a part of Hilton. In addition, we may not be able to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company in the time we expect, if at all. In addition, as part of the spin-off, we incurred a significant amount of indebtedness to finance the various costs and expenses related to the transaction. Specifically, in connection with the spin-off, we entered into a new senior secured credit facility and immediately drew down the full $200 million of the term loan component of the arrangement. Furthermore, we drew down $300 million that was available under the financing receivable facility as part of the spin-off. The additional amount of indebtedness, the related debt service and the additional restrictions may make it difficult for the company to achieve all of the financial benefits from the spin-off. See the risks discussed under the headings \u201cCertain of our debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities\u201d and \u201cServicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are not within our control\u201d for additional discussions of these risks.\nOur accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared to meet the financial reporting and other requirements to which we are subject following the distribution as an independent company, and failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and the price of our common stock.\nOur financial results previously were included within the consolidated results of Hilton, and we believe that our financial reporting and internal controls were appropriate for a subsidiary of a public company. However, we were not directly subject to the reporting and other requirements of the Exchange Act. As a result of the distribution, we are directly subject to reporting and other obligations under the Exchange Act. Beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2017, we will be required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) which will require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm as to whether we maintained, in all material respects, effective internal controls over financial reporting as of the last day of the year. These reporting and other obligations may place significant demands on our management, administrative and operational resources, including accounting systems and resources.\nThe Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. To comply with these requirements, we may need to upgrade our systems; implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; and hire additional accounting and finance staff. We expect to incur additional annual expenses for the purpose of addressing these requirements, and those expenses may be significant. If we are unable to upgrade\nour financial and management controls, reporting systems, information technology systems and procedures in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under the Exchange Act could be impaired.\nIf, during periods we are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal controls, we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting or our independent public accounting firm is unwilling or unable to provide us with an unqualified report on the effectiveness of our internal controls as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis, investors may lose confidence in our operating results, the price of our common stock could decline and we may be subject to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions, which would require additional financial and management resources. This could have a material adverse effect on our business and lead to a decline in the price of our common stock.\nWe are dependent on Hilton to provide certain services pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement.\nWe have been developing the capability to provide certain corporate and administrative services such as certain information technology, financial and human resource services internally at HGV. However, to the extent that we are unable to develop such capabilities adequately in a timely manner, we will rely on Hilton to continue to provide certain services for a period of time pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement. If Hilton is unable or unwilling to provide such services pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, or if the agreement is terminated prior to the end of its term, we may be unable to provide such services ourselves or we may have to incur additional expenditures to obtain such services from another provider.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe interests of certain of our stockholders may conflict with ours or yours in the future.\nImmediately following the spin-off, Blackstone and its affiliates beneficially owned approximately 40 percent of our common stock, although less than a majority of the total voting power and, immediately following the Sale, 25 percent of the voting power in HGV will be controlled by HNA and approximately 15 percent will be controlled by Blackstone. One member of our board of directors is a Blackstone employee and upon consummation of the Sale, our board of directors will include designees of HNA. Thus, for so long as Blackstone, HNA and their respective affiliates continue to own specified percentages of our common stock, each of Blackstone and HNA will be able to influence the composition of our board of directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval. Accordingly, during that period of time each of, Blackstone and HNA will have influence with respect to our management, business plans and policies, including the appointment and removal of our officers. For example, for so long as Blackstone or HNA continues to own a significant percentage of our stock, Blackstone or HNA may be able to influence whether or not a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our board of directors occurs. The concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock.\nBlackstone, HNA and their respective affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities, including investments in real estate generally and in the hospitality industry in particular. In the ordinary course of their business activities, Blackstone, HNA and their respective affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with our interests or those of our stockholders. For example, all of the timeshare properties that we manage as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K utilize certain Hilton-branded trademarks and Hilton trade names and related intellectual property. Blackstone and its affiliates own, and following the proposed sale by Blackstone of its interest in Hilton to HNA, HNA will own, a significant portion of the outstanding stock of Hilton and have significant influence with respect to the management, business plans and policies of Hilton. In addition, Blackstone, HNA and their respective affiliates may pursue ventures that compete directly or indirectly with us. Moreover, affiliates of Blackstone or HNA may directly and indirectly own interests in timeshare property developers or others with whom we may engage in the future, may compete with us for investment opportunities and may enter into other transactions with us that could result in their having interests that could\nconflict with ours. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of Blackstone, any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us (including any non-employee director who serves as one of our officers in both his or her director and officer capacities) or his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. Upon consummation of the Sale, we will amend and restate our charter to include a similar provision with respect to HNA. Blackstone or HNA also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may be unavailable to us. In addition, Blackstone or HNA may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their respective investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to you.\nOur board of directors may change significant corporate policies without stockholder approval.\nOur financing, borrowing and dividend policies and our policies with respect to all other activities, including growth, debt, capitalization and operations, will be determined by our board of directors. These policies may be amended or revised at any time and from time to time at the discretion of our board of directors without a vote of our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may change our policies with respect to conflicts of interest provided that such changes are consistent with applicable legal requirements. A change in these policies could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our cash flow, the per share trading price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. Among other things:\n\u2022\nalthough we do not have a stockholder rights plan, and would either submit any such plan to stockholders for ratification or cause such plan to expire within a year, these provisions would allow us to authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock in connection with a stockholder rights plan or otherwise, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u2022\nthese provisions prohibit stockholder action by written consent from and after the date on which Blackstone and its affiliates cease to beneficially own at least 40 percent of the total voting power of all then outstanding shares of our capital stock unless such action is recommended by all directors then in office;\n\u2022\nthese provisions provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws and that our stockholders may only amend our bylaws with the approval of 80 percent or more of all the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote; and\n\u2022\nthese provisions establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nFurther, as a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate widely.\nFor many reasons, including the risks identified in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the market price of our common stock may be more volatile than the market price of Hilton common stock before the spin-off. These factors may result in short-term or long-term negative pressure on the value of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\na shift in our investor base;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of comparable companies;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant investments, acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nthe operating performance and stock price of comparable companies;\n\u2022\noverall market fluctuations;\n\u2022\na decline in the real estate markets; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and other external factors.\nFuture issuances of common stock by us, and the availability for resale of shares held by Blackstone and its affiliates, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could substantially decrease the market price of our common stock. Substantially all of the outstanding shares of our common stock were available for resale in the public market following the spin-off. The market price of our common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. In addition, Blackstone has pledged substantially all of the shares of our common stock held by it pursuant to a margin loan agreement and any foreclosure upon those shares could result in sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, which could substantially decrease the market price of our common stock.\nPursuant to a registration rights agreement that we entered into in connection with the spin-off as described under \u201cBusiness-Our Business-Key Agreements Related to the Spin-Off-Registration Rights Agreements,\u201d we have granted Blackstone an unlimited number of \u201cdemand\u201d registrations and customary \u201cpiggyback\u201d registration rights. In addition, in connection with the Sale, we entered into a registration rights agreement with HNA that will be effective upon the closing of the Sale. The HNA registration rights agreement provides that, beginning two years after the closing of the Sale, HNA will have customary \u201cdemand\u201d and \u201cpiggyback\u201d registration rights. See \u201cBusiness-Our Business-Key Agreements Related to the Spin-Off-Registration Rights Agreements\u201d for additional information. In addition, none of the shares outstanding upon consummation of the spin-off, including those held by Blackstone and its affiliates, were \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), and will be freely tradable subject to certain restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates.\nAccordingly, the market price of our stock could decline if Blackstone or its affiliates or HNA exercise their registration rights, sell their shares in the open market or otherwise or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them.\nIn connection with the spin-off, we adopted an Omnibus Incentive Plan, under which an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of common stock are available for future issuance. Equity-based awards that were outstanding under the Hilton Incentive Plan on the distribution date and held by our Employees were converted into awards that are or will be exercisable for or settleable in shares of our common stock, and the number of shares available for future issuance under the Omnibus Incentive Plan includes approximately 1,175,000 shares of our common stock which would be issuable under such converted awards. The number of shares subject to such converted awards is calculated based on assumed adjustments to Hilton using the closing price of Hilton stock as of November 8, 2016 and a hypothetical price of our stock, assuming that all performance-vesting awards vest at target performance levels. The actual number of shares of our common stock subject to converted awards may differ from the assumed amounts presented herein. In addition, in connection with the spin-off, we adopted a Non-Employee Director Stock Plan, under which an aggregate of 325,000 shares of our common stock are available for future issuance. We have filed a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock issued pursuant to our Omnibus Incentive Plan and Non-Employee Director Stock Plan. Accordingly, shares registered under such registration statements may be sold in the open market.\nWe have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends in the future.\nAlthough we expect to return capital to stockholders through dividends or otherwise in the future, we have no current plans to pay any cash dividends. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors. Our board of directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by the Credit Agreement, dated December 28, 2016, among Hilton Grand Vacations Parent LLC, Hilton Grand Vacations Borrower LLC, the other guarantors party thereto from time to time, Deutsche Bank AG, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto from time to time, and may be limited by covenants of other indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur in the future.", "PERMNO": 16498, "SIC": 6532, "TIC": "HGV"}
