Risk Factors.\nOwning our common stock involves a number of significant risks. You should consider carefully the following risk factors. If any of the following risks, as well as additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, occur, our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or a part of the value of your ownership in our common stock. In addition, the statements in the following risk factors include forward-looking statements. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, including the resulting economic slowdown, travel restrictions and decrease in demand for our hotel properties, has significantly adversely impacted and disrupted, and is expected to continue to significantly adversely impact and disrupt, our business, financial performance and condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has had and continues to have, and another pandemic in the future could similarly have, significant repercussions across regional and global economies and financial markets. The global and sustained impact of the outbreak and resulting control measures, including states of emergency, mandatory quarantines, \"shelter in place\" orders, border closures, and travel and large gatherings restrictions, have significantly decreased the demand for travel to our hotel properties. We have been and expect to continue to be negatively affected by these and other governmental regulations and travel advisories to fight the pandemic, including recommendations by the U.S. Department of State, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a global economic slowdown.\nCOVID-19 has disrupted and has had a significant adverse effect on, and will continue to significantly adversely impact and disrupt, our business, financial performance and condition, operating results and cash flows. The effects of the pandemic on the hotel industry are unprecedented. Global demand for lodging has been drastically reduced and occupancy levels have reached historic lows in 2020. Since late February 2020, we have experienced a significant decline in occupancy and RevPAR associated with COVID-19 throughout our portfolio. Additionally, the vast majority of our group business through the first half of 2021 has now been canceled and we continue to see a significant reduction in new reservations. Additionally, travel, especially business and leisure travel in the United States, where all of our hotels are located, has continued to be adversely affected as result of COVID-19. It is not currently known when our hotels operating at a reduced capacity will return to regular operations, when demand for travel (including business and leisure travel and demand for conference space) will increase or if we will need to suspend operations or decrease capacity at additional hotel properties in the future, including as a result of increase or changes to government regulations, an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases or changes in business and other consumer preferences for travel.\nAdditional factors that would negatively impact our ability to successfully operate during or following COVID-19 or another pandemic, or that could otherwise significantly adversely impact and disrupt our business, financial performance and condition, operating results and cash flows, include:\n\u2022\nsustained negative consumer or business sentiment, economic metrics (including unemployment levels, discretionary spending and declines in personal wealth) or demand for travel, including beyond the end of the COVID-19 pandemic and the lifting of travel restrictions and advisories, which could further adversely impact demand for lodging;\n\u2022\nlimited opportunities to acquire new properties or the need to dispose of properties to meet liquidity needs;\n\u2022\nincreased costs to maintain hotels, including hotels whose operations are suspended, and increased sanitation and hygiene requirements, social distancing and other mitigation measures at hotels that continue to operate or that begin operating again;\n\u2022\nthe scaling back or delay of a significant amount of planned capital expenditures, including planned renovation projects, which could adversely affect the value of our properties and guest experience at our properties;\n\u2022\nunexpected increase in our cash burn rate, which is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including related to hotel working capital needs as well as the terms of any financing available to us, which could mean we do not have sufficient liquidity to withstand any sustained decreases in occupancy or RevPAR in 2021 from historical levels;\n\u2022\nsustained reduction or elimination of quarterly dividends;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain bank lending or access the capital markets could deteriorate as a result of the pandemic, including its impact of our business and the economy;\n\u2022\nour increased indebtedness and decreased operating revenues, which could increase our risk of default on our loans;\n\u2022\nwe may require additional indebtedness, which may contain even more restrictive covenants than our existing indebtedness or may require incremental collateral;\n\u2022\nour dependence on our hotel managers, who are facing similar challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in our supply chains, which may impact our hotels that are still operating;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in the continued service and availability of personnel, including our senior leadership team and key field personnel, and our ability to recruit, attract and retain skilled personnel to the extent our management or personnel are impacted by the outbreak of pandemic or epidemic disease and are not available or allowed to conduct work;\n\u2022\ndisruptions as a result of corporate employees working remotely, including risk of cybersecurity incidents and disruptions to internal control procedures; and\n\u2022\nbenefits of government action to provide financial support to affected industries, including the travel and hospitality industry, may not be available to us or our operators.\nMoreover, many of the risk factors set forth elsewhere in the below risk factors should be interpreted as heightened risks as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, historical data regarding our business, properties, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity prior to the first quarter of 2020 does not reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures, and therefore comparability of our results between periods may be limited.\nThe significance, extent and duration of the impacts caused by the COVID-19 outbreak on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, remains largely uncertain and dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the continued severity, duration (including the extent of any resurgences in the future), transmission rate and geographic spread of COVID-19 in the United States, the extent and effectiveness of the containment measures taken, the timing of and manner in which containment efforts are reduced or lifted, the timing, efficacy, and availability and deployment of vaccinations and other treatments to combat COVID-19, and the response of the overall economy, the financial markets and the population, particularly in areas in which we operate, once the current or any future containment measures are reduced or lifted. As a result, we cannot provide an estimate of the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business or when, or if, we will be able to resume normal, pre-COVID-19 level operations.\nThe significant adverse effect that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the hospitality industry is likely to cause impairment in our long-lived assets.\nThe spread of COVID-19 and the recent developments surrounding the global pandemic are having an unprecedented adverse impact on the hospitality industry. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $607 million of impairment losses for goodwill and $90 million of impairment losses related to certain of our assets resulting from a significant decline in market value of those assets. We can provide no assurance that a further material impairment loss of assets will not occur in a future period, and the risk of future material impairments has been significantly heightened as result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Further impairment losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results and our ability to secure financing.\nWe face various risks posed by our acquisition activities.\nA key element of our business strategy is identifying and consummating acquisitions of additional hotels and portfolios. We can provide no assurances that we will be successful in identifying attractive hotels in the future or that, once identified, we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions. We also face significant competition for attractive investment opportunities, which may impact our ability acquire certain hotels or portfolios that we deem attractive at a favorable price, pursuant to acceptable terms, or at all. Any delay or failure on our part to identify, negotiate, finance on favorable terms, consummate and integrate such acquisitions could materially increase our costs or impede our growth.\nWe may continue to seek to sell certain hotels as we seek to pursue growth and diversification through prudent capital allocation. However, investments in real estate are illiquid, and it may not be possible to dispose of assets in a timely manner or on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operation results and cash flows.\nOur ability to dispose of properties on advantageous terms depends on factors beyond our control, including competition from other sellers and the availability of attractive financing for potential buyers, and we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any hotel we desire to for the price or on the terms set by us or acceptable to us, or the length of time needed to find a willing buyer and to close the sale of the hotel. Upon sales of properties or assets, we may become subject to contractual indemnity obligations, incur unusual or extraordinary distribution requirements, be required to expend funds to correct defects or make capital improvements or, as a result of required debt repayment, face a shortage of liquidity. In addition, many of our hotel management and franchise agreements generally contain restrictive covenants that limit or restrict our ability to sell a hotel free of the management or franchise encumbrance other than to permitted transferees, and as a result we may be prohibited from taking disposition actions that would otherwise be in our and our stockholders\u2019 best interests.\nMoreover, the Code imposes restrictions on a REIT\u2019s ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. In addition, our ability to dispose of some of our hotels could be constrained by their tax attributes. Many of our hotels, including related ancillary personal property, may have low tax bases. If we dispose of these hotels in taxable transactions, we may be required to pay tax on the sale and will be required distribute the after-tax gain to our stockholders under the requirements of the Code applicable to REITs, which, in turn, would impact our cash flow. Therefore, as a result of the foregoing events or circumstances, we may not be able to adjust the composition of our portfolio promptly, on favorable terms or at all in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions, which may adversely affect our cash flows and our ability to make distributions to stockholders.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the concentration of our portfolio in the Hilton family of brands. Any deterioration in the quality or reputation of the Hilton brands could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA majority of our properties currently utilize brands owned by Hilton and participate in the Hilton Honors guest loyalty and rewards program. As a result, our ability to attract and retain guests depends, in part, on the public recognition of the Hilton brands and their associated reputation. Changes in ownership or management practices, the occurrence of accidents or injuries, force majeure events, crime, individual guest notoriety or similar events at our hotels or other properties managed, owned or leased by Hilton can harm our reputation, create adverse publicity, subject us to legal claims and cause a loss of consumer confidence in our business. If the Hilton brands become obsolete or consumers view them as unfashionable or lacking in consistency and quality, we may be unable to attract guests to our hotels, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, any adverse developments in Hilton\u2019s business and affairs, reputation or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nHilton Honors guest loyalty program allows program members to accumulate points based on eligible stays and hotel charges and redeem the points for a range of benefits, including free rooms and other items of value. The program is an important aspect of our business and of the affiliation value of a majority of our hotels. Changes to the Hilton Honors loyalty program, which we do not control, or our access to it could negatively impact our business. If the program deteriorates or materially changes in an adverse manner, or if currently tax-exempt program benefits become subject to taxation such that a material number of Hilton Honors members choose to no longer participate in the program, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nContractual and other disagreements with or involving our current and future third-party hotel managers and franchisors could make us liable to them or result in litigation costs or other expenses.\nOur management and franchise agreements require us and our managers to comply with operational and performance conditions that are subject to interpretation and could result in disagreements, and we expect this will be true of any management and franchise agreements that we enter into with future third-party hotel managers or franchisors. We cannot predict the outcome of any arbitration or litigation related to such agreements, the effect of any negative judgment against us or the amount of any settlement that we may enter into with any third-party. In the event we terminate a management or franchise agreement early and the hotel manager or franchisor considers such termination to have been wrongful, they may seek damages. Additionally, we may be required to indemnify our third-party hotel managers and franchisors against disputes with third parties pursuant to our management and franchise agreements. An adverse result in any of these proceedings could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe are dependent on the performance of our managers and could be materially and adversely affected if our managers do not properly manage our hotels or otherwise act in our best interests or if we are unable to maintain a good relationship with our third-party hotel managers.\nIn order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT, independent third parties must operate our hotels. Except for the Select Hotels, we lease substantially all of our hotels to our TRS lessees. Our TRS lessees and the TRSs that own our hotels, in turn, have entered into management agreements with third-party managers to operate our hotels. We could be materially and adversely affected if any third-party hotel manager fails to provide quality services and amenities, fails to maintain a quality brand name or otherwise fails to manage our hotels in our best interest, and could be held financially responsible for the actions and inactions of our third-party hotel managers pursuant to our management agreements. In addition, our third-party hotel managers manage, and in some cases may own or lease, or may have invested in or may have provided credit support or operating guarantees to hotels that compete with our hotels, any of which could result in conflicts of interest. As a result, third-party managers may make decisions regarding competing lodging facilities that are not in our best interests.\nThe success of our properties largely depends on our ability to establish and maintain good relationships with our hotel managers and other third-party hotel managers and franchisors that we may engage in the future. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our third-party hotel managers and franchisors, we may be unable to renew existing management or franchise agreements or expand relationships with them. Additionally, opportunities for developing new relationships with additional third-party managers or franchisors may be adversely affected. This, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to execute our growth strategy. In the event that we terminate any of our management agreements, we can provide no assurances that we could find a replacement hotel manager or that any replacement hotel manager will be successful in operating our hotels. If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could materially and adversely affect us.\nCyber threats and the risk of data breaches or disruptions of our hotel managers\u2019 or our own information technology systems could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur hotel managers are dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to access, process, transmit and store proprietary and customer information, including personally identifiable information of hotel guests, including credit card numbers.\nThese information networks and systems can be vulnerable to threats such as system, network or internet failures; computer hacking or business disruption, including through network- and email-based attacks; cyber-terrorism; viruses, worms or other malicious software programs; and employee error, negligence or fraud. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, nation-state affiliated actors and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. We rely on our hotel managers to protect proprietary and customer information from these threats. Any compromise of our own network or hotel managers\u2019 networks could result in a disruption to our booking or sales systems or other operations, in increased costs (e.g., related to response, investigation, and notification) or in potential litigation and liability. In addition, public disclosure or loss of customer or proprietary information could result in damage to the hotel manager\u2019s reputation, a loss of confidence among hotel guests, reputational harm for our hotels and potential litigation, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to the information technologies and systems our hotel managers use to operate our hotels, we have our own corporate technologies and systems that are used to access, store, transmit, and manage or support a variety of business processes and employee personally identifiable information. We may be required to expend significant attention and financial resources to protect these technologies and systems against physical or cybersecurity incidents and even then our security measures may subsequently be deemed to have been inadequate by regulators or courts given the lack of prescriptive measures in data security and cybersecurity laws. There can be no assurance that the security measures we have taken to protect the contents of these systems will prevent failures, inadequacies or interruptions in system services or that system security will not be breached through system or user error, physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, or attacks by hackers. Any such breach could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial reporting and compliance, and could subject us to or result in liability claims, monetary losses or regulatory penalties which could be significant.\nCosts associated with, or failure to maintain, brand operating standards may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.\nThe terms of our franchise and brand management agreements generally require us to meet specified operating standards and other terms and conditions, and compliance with such standards may be costly. Failure by us, or any hotel management company that we engage, to maintain these standards or other terms and conditions could result in a franchise license being canceled or the franchisor requiring us to undertake a costly property improvement program. If a franchise license is terminated due to our failure to make required improvements or to otherwise comply with its terms, we also may be liable to the franchisor for a termination payment, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.\nIf we were to lose a brand license, the underlying value of a particular hotel could decline significantly (including from the loss of brand name recognition, marketing support, guest loyalty programs, brand manager or franchisor central reservation systems or other systems), which could require us to recognize an impairment on the hotel. Furthermore, the loss of a franchise license at a particular hotel could harm our relationship with the franchisor or brand manager and cause us to incur significant costs to obtain a new franchise license or brand management agreement for the particular hotel. Accordingly, if we lose one or more franchise licenses or brand management agreements, it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth.\nOur efforts to develop, redevelop or renovate our properties, in connection with our active asset management strategy, could be delayed or become more expensive, which could reduce revenues or impair our ability to compete effectively.\nIf not maintained, the condition of certain of our properties could negatively affect our ability to attract guests or result in higher operating and capital costs. These factors could reduce revenues or profits from these properties. There can be no assurance that our planned replacements and repairs will occur, or even if completed, will result in improved performance. In addition, these efforts are subject to a number of risks, including the following: construction delays or cost overruns; delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, zoning, occupancy and other required permits or authorizations; government restrictions on the size or kind of development; changes in economic conditions that may result in weakened or lack of demand for improvements that we make or negative project returns; and lack of availability of rooms or meeting spaces for revenue-generating activities during construction, modernization or\nrenovation projects. If our properties are not updated to meet guest preferences, if properties under development or renovation are delayed in opening as scheduled, or if renovation investments adversely affect or fail to improve performance, our operations and financial results could be negatively affected.\nOur hotels are geographically concentrated in a limited number of markets and, accordingly, we could be disproportionately harmed by adverse changes to these markets, natural disasters or terrorist attacks.\nA significant portion of our room count is located in a concentrated number of markets that exposes us to greater risk to local economic or business conditions, changes in hotel supply in these markets, and other conditions than more geographically diversified hotel companies. As of December 31, 2020, hotels in New York City, Washington, D.C., Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, New Orleans, Florida and Hawaii represented approximately 70% of our room count, with our hotels in Florida, San Francisco and Hawaii alone each representing greater than 11% of our room count. An economic downturn, an increase in hotel supply, a force majeure event, a natural disaster, a terrorist attack or similar event in any one of these markets likely would cause a decline in the hotel market and adversely affect occupancy rates, the financial performance of our hotels in these markets and our overall results of operations, which could be material, and could significantly increase our costs.\nIf the insurance that we carry does not sufficiently cover damage or other potential losses or liabilities involving our properties, including as a result of terrorism, our profits could be reduced.\nBecause certain types of losses are uncertain, including natural disaster or other catastrophic losses, they may be uninsurable or prohibitively expensive. There are also other risks that may fall outside the general coverage terms and limits of our policies. Market forces beyond our control could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we can obtain or may otherwise restrict our ability to buy insurance coverage at reasonable rates. In the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage that we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full value of our financial obligations, our liabilities or the replacement cost of any lost investment or property. Furthermore, certain of our properties may qualify as legally permissible nonconforming uses and improvements, including certain of our iconic and most profitable properties, and we may not be permitted to rebuild such properties as they exist now or at all, regardless of insurance proceeds, if such properties are destroyed. Any loss of this nature, whether insured or not, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, we carry insurance to respond to both first-party and third-party liability losses related to terrorism under a program authorized by Congress following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, which is set to expire in 2027. If the program is not extended or renewed upon its expiration in 2027, or if there are changes to the program that would negatively affect insurance carriers, premiums for terrorism insurance coverage will likely increase and/or the terms of such insurance may be materially amended to increase stated exclusions or to otherwise effectively decrease the scope of coverage available, perhaps to the point where it is effectively unavailable.\nWe have investments in joint venture projects, which limit our ability to manage third-party risks associated with these projects.\nIn certain cases, we are minority participants and do not control the decisions of the joint ventures in which we are involved. Consequently, actions by a co-venturer or other third-party outside of our control could expose us to claims for damages, financial penalties and reputational harm, any of which could adversely affect our business and operations. In addition, we may be unable to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners (including approving distributions even from joint ventures with positive cash flow), or our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent (including actions taken that are inconsistent with our business interest or goals). Moreover, we may agree to guarantee indebtedness incurred by a joint venture or co-venturer or provide standard indemnifications to lenders for loss liability or damage occurring as a result of our actions or actions of the joint venture or other co-venturers. Such a guarantee or indemnity may be on a joint and several basis with a co-venturer, in which case we may be liable in the event that our co-venturer defaults on its guarantee obligation. The non-performance of a co-venturer\u2019s obligations (including due to bankruptcy or inability of such party to meet their capital contribution or other financial obligations) may cause losses to us in excess of the capital we initially may have invested or committed.\nIn addition, preparing our financial statements requires us to have access to information regarding the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of our joint ventures. Any deficiencies in our joint ventures\u2019 internal controls over financial reporting may affect our ability to report our financial results accurately or prevent or detect fraud. Such deficiencies also could result in restatements of, or other adjustments to, our previously reported or announced operating results, which could diminish investor confidence and reduce the market price for our shares. Additionally, if our joint ventures are unable to provide this information for any meaningful period or fail to meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to satisfy our financial reporting obligations or timely file our periodic reports, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, growth or liquidity, including our ability to access external sources of capital and our cost of capital.\nWe depend on external sources of capital for future growth. Any disruption to our ability to access capital at times and on terms reasonably acceptable to us may affect adversely our business and results of operations.\nOwnership of hotels is a capital-intensive business that requires significant capital expenditures to acquire, operate, maintain and renovate properties. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain), including taxable income recognized for U.S. federal income tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive cash. As a result, we must finance our growth, fund debt repayments and fund significant capital expenditures largely with external sources of capital. Our ability to access external capital could be hampered by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, macroeconomic changes, changes in market perceptions of our growth potential, fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, and changes in the terms of our indebtedness, any of which may be outside of our control, and which, individually or in combination, could prevent us from being able to obtain the external capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance our future growth, our cost of capital, our liquidity and our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel, particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor, which could increase our operating costs, reduce the flexibility of our hotel managers to adjust the size of the workforce at our hotels and could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWhile our hotel managers are generally responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at our hotels other than the Select Hotels, we are subject to the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force, and increased labor costs due to factors like additional taxes or requirements to incur additional employee benefits costs may adversely impact our operating costs. Labor costs can be particularly challenging at those of our hotels with unionized labor, and additional hotels may be subject to new collective bargaining agreements in the future.\nFrom time to time, strikes, lockouts, public demonstrations or other negative actions and publicity may disrupt hotel operations at any of our hotels, negatively impact our reputation or the reputation of our brands, or harm relationships with the labor forces at our hotels. We also may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contract disputes or other events. Additionally, hotels where our hotel managers have collective bargaining agreements with employees are more highly affected by labor force activities than others. The resolution of labor disputes or new or re-negotiated labor contracts could lead to increased labor costs, either by increases in wages or benefits or by changes in work rules that raise hotel operating costs. Furthermore, labor agreements may limit the ability of our hotel managers to reduce the size of hotel workforces during an economic downturn because collective bargaining agreements are negotiated between the hotel managers and labor unions. Except with respect to the employees of the Select Hotels, we do not have the ability to control the outcome of these negotiations.\nWe could be materially and adversely affected if we are found to be in breach of a ground lease or are unable to renew a ground lease.\nUnless we purchase a fee interest in the land and improvements subject to our ground leases or extend the terms of these leases before their expiration, we will lose our right to operate these properties and we will not have any economic interest in the land or improvements at the expiration of our ground leases; therefore, we generally will not share in any increase in value of the land or improvements beyond the term of a ground lease, notwithstanding our capital outlay to purchase our interest in the hotel or fund improvements thereon, and will lose our right to use the hotel. We can provide no assurances that we will be able to renew any ground lease upon its expiration at all or on favorable terms. In addition, if we are found to be in breach of certain of our third-party ground leases, we could lose the right to use the applicable hotel. Our ability to exercise any extension options relating to our ground leases is subject to the condition that we are not in default under the terms of the ground lease at the time that we exercise such options. Additionally, if a governmental authority seizes a hotel subject to a ground lease under its eminent domain power, we may only be entitled to a portion of any compensation awarded for the seizure. If we were to lose the right to use a hotel, we would be unable to derive income from such hotel, which could adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe lodging industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors are other owners and investors in upper upscale, full-service hotels, including other lodging REITs, as well as major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands. Our hotels face competition for individual guests, group reservations and conference business. We also compete against smaller hotel chains and independent and local hotel owners and operators. We also face competition from peer-to-peer inventory sources that allow\ntravelers to stay at homes and apartments booked from owners. New hotels may be constructed, and these additions create new competitors, in some cases without corresponding increases in demand for hotel rooms. Our competitors may have greater commercial, financial and marketing resources and more efficient technology platforms, which could allow them to improve their properties and expand and improve their marketing efforts in ways that could affect our ability to compete for guests effectively and adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth.\nThe lodging industry is subject to seasonal volatility, which is expected to contribute to fluctuations in our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe lodging industry is typically seasonal in nature. The periods during which our properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property, depending principally upon location and the customer base served. This seasonality can be expected to cause periodic fluctuations in a hotel\u2019s rooms revenues, occupancy levels, room rates and operating expenses. We can provide no assurances that our cash flows will be sufficient to offset any shortfalls that occur as a result of these fluctuations. Consequently, volatility in our financial performance resulting from the seasonality of the lodging industry could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernmental regulation may adversely affect the operation of our properties and our Company as a whole.\nThe hotel industry is subject to extensive U.S. federal, state and local governmental regulations, including those relating to the service of alcoholic beverages, the preparation and sale of food, building and zoning requirements and data protection, cybersecurity and privacy. We and our hotel managers are also subject to licensing and regulation by U.S. state and local departments relating to health, sanitation, fire and safety standards, and to laws governing our relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions and citizenship requirements. Our existing systems may be unable to satisfy changing regulatory requirements and employee and customer expectations, or may require significant additional investments or time to do so. We are also subject to certain environmental compliance costs, including associated air emissions, the use, storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances, and wastewater disposal. Our failure to comply with any such laws, including any required permits or licenses, or publicity resulting from actual or alleged compliance failures, could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business.\nEnvironmental laws may also impose potential liability on a current or former owner or operator of real property for, among other things, investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at our currently or formerly owned or leased real property, regardless of whether or not we knew of, or caused, the presence or release of such substances. From time to time, we may be required to remediate such substances or remove, abate or manage asbestos, mold, radon gas, lead or other hazardous conditions at our properties. The presence or release of such toxic or hazardous substances at our currently or formerly owned or leased properties could result in limitations on or interruptions to our operations or in third-party claims for personal injury, property or natural resource damages, business interruption or other losses, including liens in favor of the government for costs the government incurs in cleaning up contamination. Such claims and the need to investigate, remediate or otherwise address hazardous, toxic or unsafe conditions could adversely affect our operations, the value of any affected real property, or our ability to sell, lease or assign our rights in any such property, or could otherwise harm our business or reputation. In addition, we also may be liable for the costs of remediating contamination at off-site waste disposal facilities to which we have arranged for the disposal, transportation or treatment of hazardous substances without regard to whether we complied with environmental laws in doing so. Environmental, health and safety requirements have also become, and may continue to become, increasingly stringent, and our costs may increase as a result. New or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, such as those related to climate change, could affect the operation of our properties or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on us or our hotel managers. In addition, unlike other REITs, our active management of the Select Hotels subjects us to potential environmental liabilities associated with that business, which liabilities could be material.\nFurther, failure of a property to comply with the ADA could result in injunctive relief, fines, an award of damages to private litigants or mandated capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance. Any imposition of injunctive relief, fines, damage awards or capital expenditures could adversely impact our business or results of operations. If we fail to comply with the requirements of the ADA, we could be subject to fines, penalties, injunctive action, reputational harm and other business effects which could materially and negatively affect our performance and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, our ability to operate our business, our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments.\nOur outstanding debt and other contractual obligations could have important consequences, including requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to debt service payments, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and to pursue future business opportunities and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions, increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be better positioned to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.\nCertain of our debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities or could result in foreclosure of our hotels.\nThe debt agreements and instruments that govern our outstanding indebtedness, including our senior unsecured credit facilities and senior secured notes, impose significant financial and operating restrictions on us, including covenants that may restrict our ability to implement our business plan, finance future operations, respond to changing business and economic conditions, secure additional financing, and engage in opportunistic transactions, such as strategic acquisitions, mergers or asset sales or transactions with affiliates. In addition, if we fail to satisfy the covenants contained in the credit facilities, our ability to borrow additional funds under the credit facilities may be restricted. Furthermore, the credit agreements that govern our senior unsecured credit facilities contain certain affirmative covenants that require us to be in compliance with certain leverage, liquidity and other financial ratios and the mortgage-backed loans of our subsidiaries also require them to maintain certain debt service coverage ratios and minimum net worth requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with our financial or other covenants and, if we fail to do so, we may not be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants. Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above, as well as other terms of our other indebtedness and/or the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time, could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or are unable to refinance these borrowings, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. If we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms or at all, we may be forced to dispose of hotels at inopportune times or on disadvantageous terms, which could result in losses. To the extent we cannot meet our future debt service obligations, we will also risk losing to foreclosure some or all of our hotels that may be pledged to secure our obligation.\nFor tax purposes, a foreclosure of any of our hotels would be treated as a sale of the hotel for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage. If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the hotel, we would recognize taxable gain on foreclosure, but we would not receive any cash proceeds, which could impact our ability to meet the REIT distribution requirements imposed by the Code. In addition, we may give full or partial guarantees to lenders of mortgage debt on behalf of the entities that own our hotels. When we give a guarantee on behalf of an entity that owns one of our hotels, we will be responsible to the lender for satisfaction of the debt if it is not paid by such entity. If any of our hotels are foreclosed on due to a default, our ability to pay cash distributions to our stockholders will be limited.\nWe may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions, which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above. The use of debt to finance future acquisitions could restrict operations, inhibit our ability to grow our business and revenues, and negatively affect our business and financial results.\nWe may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. We may also incur significant additional obligations, such as trade payables, without restrictions under our debt instruments. In addition, we may incur mortgage debt by obtaining loans secured by a portfolio of some or all of the hotels that we own or acquire. To the extent we incur additional debt, the substantial leverage risks described in the preceding two risk factors would increase.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices, the method in which LIBOR is determined or the use of alternative reference rates.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have $1.3 billion of debt outstanding that is indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). In July 2017, the United Kingdom regulator that regulates LIBOR announced its intention to phase out LIBOR rates by the end of 2021. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to USD-LIBOR or the exact time when LIBOR rates will cease to be published or supported, which may occur prior to the end of 2021. Once a published\nUSD-LIBOR rate is unavailable, the interest rates on our debt which is indexed to USD-LIBOR will be determined using various alternative methods, any of which may result in interest obligations which are more than or do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on such debt if USD-LIBOR was available in its current form. Further, the same costs and risks that may lead to the unavailability of USD-LIBOR may make one or more of the alternative methods impossible or impracticable to determine. The discontinuation of a benchmark rate or other financial metric, changes in a benchmark rate or other financial metric, or changes in market perceptions of the acceptability of a benchmark rate or other financial metric, including LIBOR, could, among other things result in increased interest payments, changes to our risk exposures, or require renegotiation of previous transactions. In addition, any such discontinuation or changes, whether actual or anticipated, could result in market volatility, adverse tax or accounting effects, increased compliance, legal and operational costs, and risks associated with contract negotiations.\nRisks Related to the Spin-Off\nWe may be responsible for U.S. federal income tax liabilities that relate to the spin-off.\nHilton Parent received a ruling (\u201cIRS Ruling\u201d) from the U.S Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) regarding certain U.S. federal income tax aspects of the spin-off. The IRS Ruling received is binding on the IRS, however, the validity of the IRS Ruling is based upon and subject to the accuracy of factual statements and representations made to the IRS by Hilton Parent. As a result of the IRS\u2019s ruling policy at the time of Hilton Parent\u2019s submission, with respect to transactions under Section 355 of the Code, the IRS Ruling is limited to specified aspects of the spin-off under Section 355 of the Code and does not represent a determination by the IRS that all of the requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment to holders of Hilton Parent\u2019s common stock and to Hilton have been satisfied. Moreover, if any statement or representation upon which the IRS Ruling is based is incorrect or untrue in any material respect, or if the facts upon which the IRS Ruling is based are materially different from the facts that prevailed at the time of the spin-off, the IRS Ruling could be invalidated.\nIf all or a portion of the spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free transaction for any reason, Hilton Parent may recognize a substantial gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, under U.S. Treasury regulations, each member of the Hilton consolidated group at the time of the spin-off (including us) would be jointly and severally liable for the resulting entire amount of any U.S. federal income tax liability. Additionally, if the distribution of HGV Parent common stock and/or the distribution of Park Parent common stock do not qualify as tax-free under Section 355 of the Code, Hilton Parent stockholders will be treated as having received a taxable dividend to the extent of Hilton Parent\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits and then would have a tax-free basis recovery up to the amount of their tax basis in their shares and then would have taxable gain from the sale or exchange of the shares to the extent of any excess.\nEven if the spin-off otherwise qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the distribution would be taxable to us, Hilton Parent and HGV Parent (but not to Hilton Parent stockholders) pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Code if there were one or more acquisitions (including issuances) of our stock, the stock of HGV Parent or the stock of Hilton Parent, representing 50% or more, measured by vote or value, of the stock of any such corporation and the acquisition or acquisitions are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution. The distribution occurred on January 3, 2017. Any acquisition of our common stock within the two-year period before or after January 3, 2017 (with exceptions, including public trading by less-than-5% stockholders and certain compensatory stock issuances) generally would be presumed to have been part of such a plan; however, that presumption is rebuttable. The resulting tax liability would be substantial, and under U.S. Treasury regulations, each member of the Hilton consolidated group at the time of the spin-off (including us) would be jointly and severally liable for the resulting U.S. federal income tax liability. We do not believe that there have been acquisitions of 50% or more of our stock pursuant to a plan that would cause the distribution to be taxable pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Code. This determination relies in part upon factual statements and representations by Hilton Parent, HGV Parent and certain of our shareholders. Also, the rules for determining whether our shares have been acquired pursuant to the requisite plan are not clear in all cases. Accordingly, the IRS or a court could disagree with our view.\nPursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, we agreed to indemnify Hilton Parent and HGV Parent for any tax liabilities resulting from certain actions we take, or fail to take, and Hilton Parent and HGV Parent agreed to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from transactions entered into by Hilton Parent or HGV Parent. For additional detail, see \u201cSpin-off Related Agreements-Tax Matters Agreement.\u201d\nWe could be required to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to Hilton Parent or HGV Parent under the Distribution Agreement or Tax Matters Agreement or could have indemnification obligations under such agreements.\nUnder the Distribution Agreement and related ancillary agreements, from and after the spin-offs, each of Hilton Parent, Park Parent and HGV Parent are generally responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses\nwhich they own and operate following the spin-off. Although we do not expect to be liable for any obligations that are not allocated to us under the Distribution Agreement, a court could disregard the allocation agreed to between the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to Hilton Parent or HGV (for example, tax and/or environmental liabilities), particularly if Hilton Parent or HGV Parent were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the allocated obligations. See \u201cSpin-off Related Agreements-Distribution Agreement.\u201d\nIn addition, the Distribution Agreement and Tax Matters Agreement provide for cross-indemnities that, except as provided in such agreements, are principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of each business with the appropriate company. As well, losses in respect of certain shared contingent liabilities, which generally are not specifically attributable to our business, HGV business or the retained business of Hilton, were determined on the date on which the Distribution Agreement was entered into. The percentage of shared contingent liabilities for which we are responsible was fixed in a manner that is intended to approximate our estimated enterprise value on the distribution date relative to the estimated enterprise values of HGV and Hilton. Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, Hilton will generally be vested with the exclusive management and control of all matters pertaining to any such shared contingent liabilities, including the prosecution of any claim and the conduct of any defense. Any of the foregoing indemnification obligations or shared contingent liabilities could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See \u201cSpin-off Related Agreements-Distribution Agreement\u201d and \u201c-Tax Matters Agreement.\u201d\nIn connection with the spin-offs, Hilton and HGV indemnified us for certain liabilities. These indemnities may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of the liabilities assumed by Hilton and HGV, and Hilton and HGV may be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the future.\nIn connection with the spin-offs, each of Hilton and HGV indemnified us with respect to such parties\u2019 assumed or retained liabilities pursuant to the Distribution Agreement and breaches of the Distribution Agreement or other agreements related to the spin-offs. There can be no assurance that the indemnities from each of Hilton and HGV will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these and other liabilities. Third parties also could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Hilton and HGV have agreed to assume. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Hilton or HGV any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear those losses. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to our REIT Status and Certain Other Tax Items\nIf we do not maintain our qualification as a REIT, we will be subject to tax as a C corporation and could face a substantial tax liability.\nWe have been taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning January 4, 2017. We believe we have been organized and operated, and expect to continue to be organized and operate, in a manner to qualify as a REIT. However, qualification as a REIT involves the interpretation and application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which no or only a limited number of judicial or administrative interpretations may exist. Notwithstanding the availability of cure provisions in the Code, we could fail to meet various compliance requirements, which could jeopardize our REIT status. Furthermore, new tax legislation, administrative guidance or court decisions, in each instance potentially with retroactive effect, could make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a REIT. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any tax year, then:\n\u2022\nwe would be taxed as a C corporation, which under current laws, among other things, means being unable to deduct dividends paid to stockholders in computing taxable income and being subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate income tax rates;\n\u2022\nany resulting tax liability could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our value and financial condition;\n\u2022\nunless we were entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we would be required to pay income taxes, and thus, our cash available for distribution to stockholders would be reduced for each of the years during which we did not qualify as a REIT; and\n\u2022\nwe generally would not be eligible to requalify as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years.\nAs a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT could impair our ability to execute our business and growth strategies, as well as make it more difficult for us to raise capital and service our indebtedness. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders, and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits.\nPark would incur adverse tax consequences if Chesapeake or any of Park or Chesapeake\u2019s subsidiary REITs failed to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nPark accepted that Chesapeake qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes prior to the Merger and that Park will be able to continue to qualify as a REIT following the Merger. However, if Chesapeake has failed to qualify as a REIT, Merger Sub would succeed to significant tax liabilities (including the significant tax liability that would result from the deemed sale of assets by Chesapeake pursuant to the Merger) the economic burden of which would be borne by PK Domestic and Park, and Park could possibly lose its REIT status should disqualifying activities continue after the Merger. Park\u2019s REIT status is also dependent upon the ongoing qualification of subsidiary entities qualifying as REITs or TRSs, as applicable, as a result of its substantial ownership interest in those entities.\nWe may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flows.\nEven if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, built-in gain tax on the taxable sale of assets, tax on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure, and non-U.S. income, state or local income, property and transfer taxes. Moreover, if we have net income from \u201cprohibited transactions,\u201d that income will be subject to a 100% tax. In addition, we could, in certain circumstances, be required to pay an excise or penalty tax (which could be significant in amount) in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Code to maintain our qualification as a REIT. We are subject to U.S. federal and state income tax (and any applicable non-U.S. taxes) on the income earned by our TRSs. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distributions to stockholders. Finally, we have operations and assets in Puerto Rico that are subject to tax. Any of these taxes decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nComplying with REIT requirements may force us to borrow to make distributions to stockholders.\nFrom time to time, our taxable income may be greater than our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders. If we do not have other funds available in these situations, we may be unable to distribute substantially all of our taxable income as required by the REIT provisions of the Code. In addition, we may be subject to limitations on the ability to use our net operating loss carryovers to offset taxable income that we do not distribute. Thus, we could be required to borrow funds, raise additional equity capital, sell a portion of our assets at disadvantageous prices, issue securities or find another alternative to make distributions to stockholders. These options could increase our costs or reduce our equity.\nOur transactions with our TRSs may cause us to be subject to a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if those transactions are not conducted on arm\u2019s-length terms.\nThe Code imposes a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm\u2019s-length basis. The 100% tax may apply, for example, to the extent that we were found to have charged our TRS lessees rent in excess of an arm\u2019s-length rent. It is our policy to evaluate material intercompany transactions and to attempt to set the terms of such transactions so as to achieve substantially the same result as would have been the case if they were unrelated parties. As a result, we believe that all material transactions between and among us and the entities in which we own a direct or indirect interest have been and will be negotiated and structured with the intention of achieving an arm\u2019s-length result and that the potential application of the 100% excise tax will not have a material effect on us. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the TRS limitation or to avoid application of the 100% excise tax.\nIf the leases of our hotels to our TRS lessees are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will fail to qualify as a REIT.\nTo continue to qualify as a REIT, we must annually satisfy two gross income tests, under which specified percentages of our gross income must be derived from certain sources, such as \u201crents from real property.\u201d Rents paid to us by our TRS lessees pursuant to the leases of our hotels will constitute substantially all of our rents from real property gross income. In order for such rent to qualify as \u201crents from real property\u201d for purposes of the gross income tests, the leases must be respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes and not be treated as service contracts, financing arrangements, joint ventures or some other type of arrangement. We have structured our leases, and intend to structure any future leases, so that the leases will be respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with this characterization, not challenge this treatment or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If our leases are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will fail to qualify as a REIT.\nIf any third-party hotel managers do not qualify as \u201celigible independent contractors\u201d or if our hotels are not \u201cqualified lodging facilities,\u201d we will fail to qualify as a REIT.\nRent paid by a lessee that is a \u201crelated party tenant\u201d of ours will not be qualifying income for purposes of the two gross income tests applicable to REITs. An exception is provided, however, for leases of \u201cqualified lodging facilities\u201d to a TRS so long as the hotels are operated by an \u201celigible independent contractor\u201d and certain other requirements are satisfied. Substantially all of our hotels are leased to our TRS lessees which have engaged third-party hotel managers (including Hilton, which manages a majority of our hotels) that we believe qualify as \u201celigible independent contractors.\u201d Among other requirements, an operator will qualify as an eligible independent contractor if it meets certain ownership tests with respect to us, and if, at the time the operator enters into a property management contract with a TRS or its TRS lessee with respect to one of our properties, the operator is actively engaged in the trade or business of operating \u201cqualified lodging facilities\u201d (as defined below) for one or more persons not related to the REIT or its TRSs. No assurances can be provided that any of our current and future hotel managers will in fact comply with this requirement. Failure to comply with this requirement would require us to find other hotel managers for future contracts, and, if we hired a management company without knowledge of the failure, it could jeopardize our status as a REIT.\nFinally, each property with respect to which our TRS lessees pay rent must be a \u201cqualified lodging facility.\u201d A \u201cqualified lodging facility\u201d is a hotel, motel, or other establishment more than one-half of the dwelling units in which are used on a transient basis, including customary amenities and facilities, provided that no wagering activities are conducted at or in connection with such facility by any person who is engaged in the business of accepting wagers and who is legally authorized to engage in such business at or in connection with such facility. We believe that the properties that are leased to our TRS lessees are qualified lodging facilities. Although we intend to monitor future acquisitions and improvements of properties, REIT provisions of the Code provide no or only limited guidance for making determinations under the requirements for qualified lodging facilities, and there can be no assurance that these requirements will be satisfied.\nEven if we continue to qualify to be a REIT, we could be subject to tax on any recognized net built-in gains in our assets held before electing to be treated as a REIT.\nWe own appreciated assets that were held by Hilton, a C corporation, and were acquired by us in the spin-off from Hilton Parent in a transaction in which the adjusted tax basis of the assets in our hands was determined by reference to the adjusted basis of the assets in the hands of Hilton. If we dispose of any such appreciated assets during the five-year period following the effective date of our REIT election (January 4, 2017), we will be subject to tax at the highest corporate tax rates on the lesser of (i) the amount of gain that we recognize at the time of the sale or disposition; and (ii) the amount of gain that we would have recognized if we had sold the assets at the time that we acquired them (i.e., the effective date of our REIT election ) (such gain referred to as \u201cbuilt-in gains\u201d). We would be subject to this tax liability even if we maintain our status as a REIT. The amount of tax could be significant. We may choose not to sell appreciated assets we might otherwise sell during the five-year period in which the built-in gain tax applies to avoid the built-in gain tax. If we sell such assets in a taxable transaction, the amount of corporate tax that we will pay will vary depending on the actual amount of net built-in gain in those assets as of the time we became a REIT. The same rules would apply to any assets we acquire in the future from a C corporation in a carryover basis transaction with built-in gain at the time of the acquisition by us.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that stockholders might consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contains provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. Among other things, the provisions:\n\u2022\ninclude a restriction on ownership and transfer of our stock to prevent any person from acquiring more than 9.8% (in value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding common stock or more than 9.8% (in value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of any outstanding class or series of our preferred stock without the approval of our board of directors (the \u201cOwnership Limitation\u201d);\n\u2022\nwould allow us to authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock in connection with a stockholder rights plan or otherwise, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the\nholders of common stock (although we do not have a stockholder rights plan, and our policy is to either submit any such plan to stockholders for ratification or cause such plan to expire within a year);\n\u2022\nprovide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nThese anti-takeover provisions could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nThe stock ownership limits imposed by the Code for REITs and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation restrict stock transfers and/or business combination opportunities.\nIn order for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities) at any time during the last half of each taxable year. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also contains other limitations, including the Ownership Limitation, and prohibits any person from: (1) beneficially or constructively owning, as determined by applying certain attribution rules of the Code, our stock if that would result in us being \u201cclosely held\u201d under Section 856(h) of the Code or otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT; (2) beneficially or constructively owning shares of our stock that would cause any person, including Hilton Parent, to fail to qualify as our eligible independent contractor; (3) transferring stock if such transfer would result in our stock being owned by fewer than 100 persons; and (4) beneficially owning shares of our stock to the extent such ownership would result in our failing to qualify as a \u201cdomestically controlled qualified investment entity\u201d within the meaning of Section 897(h) of the Code. In addition, there can be no assurances that our board, as permitted in the charter, will not decrease the Ownership Limitation to lower than 9.8% in the future. These stock ownership limits, including the Ownership Limitation, might delay or prevent a transaction or a change in our control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 16499, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "PK"}
