Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with all other information contained in this report in connection with an investment in our securities. If any of the following risks develop into actual events, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially adversely affected, the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nBusiness and Operating Risks\nSubstantial declines in commodity prices or extended periods of low commodity prices adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and our ability to meet our capital expenditure needs and financial commitments.\nThe prices we receive for sales of our crude oil and natural gas production impact our revenue, profitability, cash flows, access to capital, capital budget, rate of growth, and carrying value of our properties. Crude oil and natural gas are commodities and prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for crude oil and natural gas have been volatile and unpredictable. For example, during 2020 the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (\u201cWTI\u201d) crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas spot prices ranged from negative $36.98 to positive $63.27 per barrel and $1.33 to $3.14 per MMBtu, respectively. Commodity prices will likely remain volatile and unpredictable in 2021 and beyond. A significant portion of our future crude oil and natural gas production is unhedged as of the time of this filing and is exposed to continued volatility in market prices, whether favorable or unfavorable.\nThe prices we receive for sales of our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022worldwide, domestic, and regional economic conditions impacting the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids;\n\u2022the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other petroleum producing nations;\n\u2022the nature, extent, and impact of domestic and foreign governmental laws, regulations, and taxation, including environmental laws and regulations governing the imposition of trade restrictions and tariffs;\n\u2022executive, regulatory or legislative actions by Congress, the Biden Administration, or states in which we operate;\n\u2022geopolitical events and conditions, including domestic political uncertainty or foreign regime changes that impact government energy policies;\n\u2022the level of global, national, and regional crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities;\n\u2022the level of global, national, and regional crude oil and natural gas inventories, which may be impacted by economic sanctions applied to certain producing nations;\n\u2022the level and effect of speculative trading in commodity futures markets;\n\u2022the relative strength of the United States dollar compared to foreign currencies;\n\u2022the price and quantity of imports of foreign crude oil;\n\u2022the price and quantity of exports of crude oil or liquefied natural gas from the United States;\n\u2022military and political conditions in, or affecting other, crude oil-producing and natural gas-producing nations;\n\u2022localized supply and demand fundamentals;\n\u2022the cost and availability, proximity and capacity of transportation, processing, storage and refining facilities for various quantities and grades of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids;\n\u2022adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, and national and global health epidemics and concerns, including the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022technological advances affecting energy production and consumption;\n\u2022the effect of worldwide energy conservation and greenhouse emission limitations or other environmental protection efforts; and\n\u2022the price and availability of alternative fuels or other energy sources.\nSustained material declines in commodity prices reduce cash flows available for capital expenditures, repayment of indebtedness and other corporate purposes; may limit our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital; and may reduce our proved reserves and the amount of crude oil and natural gas we can economically produce.\nIn addition to reducing our revenue, cash flows and earnings, depressed prices for crude oil and/or natural gas may adversely affect us in a variety of other ways. If commodity prices decrease substantially, some of our exploration and development projects could become uneconomic, and we may also have to make significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and our estimates of the present value of those reserves. If these price effects occur, or if our estimates of production or economic factors change, accounting rules may require us to write down the carrying value of our crude oil and/or natural gas properties.\nLower commodity prices may also lead to reductions in our drilling and completion programs, which may result in insufficient production to satisfy our transportation and processing commitments. If production is not sufficient to meet our commitments we would incur deficiency fees that would need to be paid absent any cash inflows generated from the sale of production.\nLower commodity prices may also reduce our access to capital and lead to a downgrade or other negative rating action with respect to our credit rating. A downgrade of our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of capital, increase borrowing costs under our revolving credit facility, and limit our ability to access capital markets and execute aspects of our business plans. As a result, substantial declines in commodity prices or extended periods of low commodity prices may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to meet our capital expenditure needs and commitments.\nThe ability or willingness of Saudi Arabia and other members of OPEC, and other oil exporting nations, including Russia, to set and maintain production levels has a significant impact on crude oil prices.\nThe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\"OPEC\") is an intergovernmental organization that seeks to manage the price and supply of crude oil on the global energy market. Actions taken by OPEC members, including those taken alongside other oil exporting nations such as Russia, may have a significant impact on global oil supply and pricing. For example, OPEC and certain other oil exporting nations have previously agreed to take measures, including production cuts, to support crude oil prices. However, in March 2020, members of OPEC and Russia were unable to agree on production levels and, in response, Saudi Arabia announced it would significantly increase production and cut the prices at which it sold crude oil. These actions, coupled with the economic impact and uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic, led to a sudden and drastic decrease in crude oil prices in March 2020, which materially impacted our business, results of operations, and cash flows. It is not certain what impact current or future agreements or disagreements among these parties will have on crude oil prices, particularly in light of the significant decrease in crude oil demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. There can be no assurance that OPEC members and other oil exporting nations will comply with agreed-upon production cuts, agree to further production cuts in the future, or utilize other actions to support and stabilize oil prices, nor can there be any assurance they will not increase production or deploy other actions aimed at reducing oil prices. Uncertainty regarding future actions to be taken by OPEC members or other oil exporting countries could lead to increased volatility in the price of oil, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur business operations, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted, and will likely continue to negatively impact, the global economy which has led to, among other things, reduced global demand for crude oil, disruption of global supply chains, and significant volatility and disruption of financial and commodity markets.\nWe began to experience material decreases in our revenues in the first quarter of 2020, which negatively impacted our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and outlook during 2020. The adverse effects of COVID-19 included or may in the future include the following:\n\u2022Historically low crude oil prices;\n\u2022Limitations on storage and transportation capacity and an inability to market our production;\n\u2022Curtailment or shutting in of production;\n\u2022Delay or cessation of drilling and completion projects;\n\u2022Insufficient production to satisfy transportation and processing commitments;\n\u2022Impairment of assets;\n\u2022Downgrades or other negative credit rating actions resulting in increased borrowing costs;\n\u2022An inability to develop acreage before lease expiration;\n\u2022A reduction in the volume and value of proved reserves from price declines, changes in drilling programs, and the effects of shutting in production;\n\u2022Our ability to repay or refinance indebtedness, increase our credit facility commitments, borrow money, or raise capital;\n\u2022Disruptions in energy industry supply chains;\n\u2022Credit losses due to insolvency of customers, joint interest owners, and counterparties;\n\u2022Cyber incidents or information security breaches resulting in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss as a consequence of employees accessing information from remote work locations; and\n\u2022Shortages of drilling rigs, well completion crews, field services, personnel, and equipment in future periods of commodity price recovery.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 and depressed crude oil prices impacts our results of operations, financial position and liquidity will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including but not limited to, the availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the ultimate duration of the pandemic, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Therefore, the degree and duration of the adverse financial impact of the pandemic cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nOur producing properties are located in limited geographic areas, making us vulnerable to risks associated with having geographically concentrated operations.\nA significant portion of our producing properties is located in the Bakken field of North Dakota and Montana, with that area comprising 53% of our crude oil and natural gas production and 61% of our crude oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. Approximately 46% of our estimated proved reserves were located in the Bakken as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, our properties in Oklahoma comprised 45% of our crude oil and natural gas production and 35% of our crude oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. Approximately 52% of our estimated proved reserves were located in Oklahoma as of December 31, 2020.\nBecause of this concentration in limited geographic areas, the success and profitability of our operations may be disproportionately exposed to regional factors compared to competitors having more geographically dispersed operations. These factors include, among others: (i) our reliance on a limited number of pipelines to deliver our production to markets, (ii) the prices of crude oil and natural gas produced from wells in the regions and other regional supply and demand factors, including gathering, pipeline and rail transportation capacity constraints; (iii) the availability of rigs, completion crews, waste water disposal wells, equipment, field services, water, supplies, and labor; (iv) the availability of processing and refining facilities; and (v) infrastructure capacity. In addition, our operations in the Bakken field and Oklahoma may be adversely affected by severe weather events such as floods, blizzards, extreme cold, ice storms, drought, and tornadoes, which can intensify competition for the items and services described above and may result in periodic shortages. The concentration of our operations in limited geographic areas also increases our exposure to changes in local laws and regulations, certain lease stipulations designed to protect wildlife, and unexpected events that may occur in the regions such as natural disasters, seismic events (which may result in third-party lawsuits), industrial accidents, labor difficulties, civil disturbances, public protests, cyber attacks, or terrorist attacks. Any one of these events has the potential to cause producing wells to be shut-in, delay operations, decrease cash flows, increase operating and capital costs and prevent development of lease inventory before expiration. Any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDrilling for and producing crude oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nOur future financial condition and results of operations depend on the success of our exploration, development and production activities. Our crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable crude oil or natural gas production. Our decisions to purchase, explore, or develop prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data, and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. Our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells may be uncertain before drilling commences.\nIn this report, we describe some of our current prospects and plans to develop our key operating areas. Our management has specifically identified prospects and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. Our ability to drill and develop these locations is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as described herein. If future drilling results do not establish sufficient reserves to achieve an economic return, we may curtail our drilling and completion activities. Prospects we decide to drill that do not produce crude oil or natural gas in expected quantities may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and rates of return on capital employed. The use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether crude oil or natural gas will be present in expected or economically producible quantities. We cannot assure you the wells we drill will be as productive as anticipated or whether the analogies we draw from other wells, more fully explored prospects, or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling prospects. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if our potential drilling locations will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce crude oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations in sufficient quantities to achieve an economic return.\nRisks we face while drilling include, but are not limited to, failing to place our well bore in the desired target producing zone; not staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation; failing to run our casing the entire length of the well bore; and not being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore. Risks we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, not being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages; failing to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations; not successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage; increased seismicity in areas near our completion activities; unintended interference of completion activities performed by us or by third parties with nearby operated or non-operated wells being drilled, completed, or producing; and failure of our optimized completion techniques to yield expected levels of production.\nFurther, many factors may occur that cause us to curtail, delay or cancel scheduled drilling and completion projects, including but not limited to:\n\u2022abnormal pressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment or qualified personnel;\n\u2022shortages of or delays in obtaining components used in fracture stimulation processes such as water and proppants;\n\u2022delays associated with suspending our operations to accommodate nearby drilling or completion operations being conducted by other operators;\n\u2022mechanical difficulties, fires, explosions, equipment failures or accidents, including ruptures of pipelines or storage facilities, or train derailments;\n\u2022restrictions on the use of underground injection wells for disposing of waste water from oil and gas activities;\n\u2022political events, public protests, civil disturbances, terrorist acts or cyber attacks;\n\u2022decreases in, or extended periods of low, crude oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022title problems;\n\u2022environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of crude oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, hydraulic fracturing fluids, toxic gas or other pollutants into the environment, including groundwater and shoreline contamination;\n\u2022adverse weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022spillage or mishandling of crude oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, hydraulic fracturing fluids, toxic gas or other pollutants by us or by third party service providers;\n\u2022limitations in infrastructure, including transportation, processing, refining and exportation capacity, or markets for crude oil and natural gas; and\n\u2022delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements including permitting.\nAny of the above risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of:\n\u2022injury or loss of life;\n\u2022damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022pollution and other environmental damage;\n\u2022regulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u2022suspension of our operations;\n\u2022repair and remediation costs; and\n\u2022litigation.\nWe are not insured against all risks associated with our business. We may elect to not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented or for other reasons. In addition, pollution and environmental risks are generally not fully insurable.\nLosses and liabilities arising from any of the above events could hinder our ability to conduct normal operations and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nReserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. The present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves. Any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves. The Company\u2019s current estimates of reserves could change, potentially in material amounts, in the future due to changes in commodity prices, business strategies, and other factors. Additionally, unless we replace our crude oil and natural gas reserves, our total reserves and production will decline, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nThe process of estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves is complex and inherently imprecise. It requires interpretation of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to current and future economic conditions, production rates, drilling and operating expenses, and commodity prices. Any significant inaccuracy in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect our estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Crude Oil and Natural Gas Operations-Proved Reserves for information about our estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves, standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, and PV-10 as of December 31, 2020.\nIn order to prepare reserve estimates, we must project production rates and the amount and timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data in preparing reserve estimates. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary which in turn can affect our ability to model the porosity, permeability and pressure relationships in unconventional resources. The process also requires economic assumptions, based on historical data projected into the future, about crude oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, and availability of funds.\nActual future production, crude oil and natural gas sales prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves will vary and could vary significantly from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the value of our assets. In addition, we may remove or adjust estimates of proved reserves, potentially in material amounts, to reflect production history, results of exploration and development activities, changes in business strategies, prevailing crude oil and natural gas prices and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nYou should not assume the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves. We base the estimated discounted future net revenues from proved reserves on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the preceding twelve months. Actual future prices may be materially higher or lower than the average prices used in the calculations. In addition, the use of a 10% discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our reserves or the crude oil and natural gas industry. For the year ended December 31, 2020, average prices used to calculate our estimated proved reserves were $39.57 per Bbl for crude oil and $1.99 per MMBtu for natural gas ($34.34 per Bbl for crude oil and $1.17 per Mcf for natural gas adjusted for location and quality differentials). NYMEX WTI crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for January 1, 2021 and February 1, 2021 averaged $51.04 per barrel and $2.53 per MMBtu, respectively. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Crude Oil and Natural Gas Operations-Proved Reserves-Proved Reserve, Standardized Measure, and PV-10 Sensitivities for proved reserve sensitivities under certain increasing and decreasing commodity price scenarios.\nIn addition, the development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer than anticipated and may not be ultimately developed or produced. At December 31, 2020, approximately 43% of our total estimated proved reserves (by volume) were\nundeveloped. Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. Our reserve estimates assume we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully. These assumptions may not prove to be accurate. Our reserve report at December 31, 2020 includes estimates of total future development costs over the next five years associated with our proved undeveloped reserves of approximately $3.9 billion. We cannot be certain the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate, development will occur as scheduled, or the results of such development will be as estimated. If we choose not to spend the capital to develop these reserves, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop these reserves as a result of our inability to fund necessary capital expenditures or otherwise, we will be required to remove the associated volumes from our reported proved reserves. Proved undeveloped reserves generally must be drilled within five years from the date of initial booking under SEC reserve rules. Changes in the timing of development plans that impact our ability to develop such reserves in the required time frame have resulted, and will likely in the future result, in fluctuations in reserves between periods as reserves booked in one period may need to be removed in a subsequent period. In 2020, 107 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves were removed from our year-end reserve estimates associated with locations no longer scheduled to be drilled within five years from the date of initial booking primarily due to a reduction in the scope of our future drilling programs based on adverse market conditions, reduced demand, and lower prices caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAdditionally, unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the locations are identified, the leases for such acreage will expire. If we are not able to renew leases before they expire, any proved undeveloped reserves associated with such leases will be removed from our proved reserves. The combined net acreage expiring in the next three years represents 50% of our total net undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2020. At that date, we had leases representing 61,293 net acres expiring in 2021, 69,609 net acres expiring in 2022, and 49,475 net acres expiring in 2023.\nFurthermore, unless we conduct successful exploration, development and exploitation activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Producing crude oil and natural gas reservoirs are generally characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future crude oil and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our cash flows and results of operations, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace our current and future production. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, the value of our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business depends on crude oil and natural gas transportation, processing, refining, and export facilities, most of which are owned by third parties.\nThe value we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering, pipeline and rail systems and processing, refining, and export facilities owned by third parties. The inadequacy or unavailability of capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the shut-in of producing wells, the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties, or higher operational costs associated with air quality compliance controls. Although we have some contractual control over the transportation of our products, changes in these business relationships or failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could adversely affect our operations. If our production becomes shut-in for any of these or other reasons, we will be unable to realize revenue from those wells until other arrangements are made for the sale or delivery of our products and acreage lease terminations could result if production is shut-in for a prolonged period.\nThe disruption of transportation, processing, refining, or export facilities due to contractual disputes or litigation, labor disputes, maintenance, civil disturbances, international trade disputes, public protests, terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, adverse weather, natural disasters, seismic events, health epidemics and concerns, changes in tax and energy policies, federal, state and international regulatory developments, changes in supply and demand, equipment failures or accidents, including pipeline and gathering system ruptures or train derailments, and general economic conditions could negatively impact our ability to achieve the most favorable prices for our crude oil and natural gas production. We have no control over when or if access to such facilities would be restored or the impact on prices in the areas we operate. A significant shut-in of production in connection with any of the aforementioned items could materially affect our cash flows, and if a substantial portion of the impacted production fulfills transportation or processing commitments or is hedged at lower than market prices, those commitments or financial hedges would have to be paid from borrowings in the absence of sufficient operating cash flows.\nOur operated crude oil and natural gas production is ultimately transported to downstream market centers in the United States primarily using transportation facilities and equipment owned and operated by third parties. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Regulation of the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Industry for a discussion of regulations impacting the transportation of crude oil and natural gas. From time to time we may sell our operated crude oil production at market centers in the United States to third parties who then subsequently export and sell the crude oil in international markets. We do not currently own or operate infrastructure used to facilitate the transportation and exportation of crude oil; however, third party compliance with regulations\nthat impact the transportation or exportation of our production may increase our costs of doing business and inhibit a third party's ability to transport and sell our production, whether domestically or internationally, the consequences of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn July 6, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (\u201cCorps\u201d), which had previously issued an easement near tribal lands allowing the Dakota Access Pipeline (\u201cDAPL\u201d) to cross a water body, had failed to adequately consider the environmental impacts under the National Environmental Protection Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d) arising out of such pipeline crossing this water body, and directed the Corps to prepare a new environmental impact statement (\u201cEIS\u201d) as well as ordering the owners of DAPL to shut down the pipeline pending completion of the EIS. The DAPL is owned and operated by a third party and carries Bakken-produced crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois. The pipeline owner sought an emergency stay of the shut-down order from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the \u201cAppeals Court\u201d). On July 14, 2020, the Appeals Court issued a temporary administrative stay of such order, which has allowed the pipeline to continue operating. On January 26, 2021, the Appeals Court affirmed that part of the lower court decision vacating the Corps\u2019 easement while it prepares a new EIS, but reversed the lower court\u2019s order to shut down the pipeline because the lower court had not properly evaluated such a move under an applicable NEPA factoring test established under case law. As stated by the Appeals Court, the Corps is within its authority to shut down the pipeline and the Appeals Court would expect the Corps to make that decision \u201cpromptly.\u201d On February 9, 2021, the Corps, through the Department of Justice, sought a delay of the proceedings to give lawyers time to brief the new presidential administration on the background of the DAPL matter. Accordingly, the continued operation of DAPL in the future is uncertain. The Company utilizes DAPL to transport a portion of its North region crude oil production to ultimate markets on the U.S. gulf coast. Currently, the Company is committed to transport 3,550 barrels per day on the pipeline through February 2026 and has an additional commitment to transport an incremental 26,450 barrels per day for 7 years effective upon the pending completion of a DAPL expansion project which is estimated to occur in the second half of 2021. If transportation capacity on DAPL becomes restricted or unavailable, we have the ability to utilize other third party pipelines or rail facilities to transport our Bakken crude oil production to market, although such alternatives may be more costly. A restriction of DAPL\u2019s takeaway capacity may have an impact on prices for Bakken-produced barrels and result in wider differentials relative to WTI benchmark prices in the future, the amount of which is uncertain.\nOur exploration, development and exploitation projects require substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on acceptable terms, which could lead to a decline in our crude oil and natural gas reserves, production and revenues.\nThe crude oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business for the exploration, development, exploitation, production and acquisition of crude oil and natural gas reserves. We have budgeted $1.40 billion for capital expenditures attributable to us in 2021 of which approximately $1.11 billion is allocated to exploration and development activities. We may adjust our 2021 capital spending plans upward or downward depending on market conditions. Our 2021 capital budget, based on our current expectations of commodity prices and costs, is expected to be funded from operating cash flows. However, the sufficiency of our cash flows from operations is subject to a number of variables, including but not limited to:\n\u2022the prices at which crude oil and natural gas are sold;\n\u2022the volume of our proved reserves;\n\u2022the volume of crude oil and natural gas we are able to produce and sell from existing wells; and\n\u2022our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;\nIf oil and gas industry conditions weaken as a result of low commodity prices or other factors, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows and may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current or planned levels. A decline in cash flows from operations may require us to revise our capital program or alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities.\nWe have a revolving credit facility with lender commitments totaling $1.5 billion that matures in April 2023. In the future, we may not be able to access adequate funding under our revolving credit facility if our lenders are unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations or increase their commitments under the credit facility. Our lenders could decline to increase their commitments based on our financial condition, the financial condition of our industry or the economy as a whole or for other reasons beyond our control. Due to these and other factors, we cannot be certain that funding, if needed, will be available to the extent required or on terms we find acceptable. If operating cash flows are insufficient and we are unable to access funding or execute capital transactions when needed on acceptable terms, we may not be able to fully implement our business plans, fund our capital program and commitments, complete new property acquisitions to replace reserves, take advantage of business\nopportunities, respond to competitive pressures, or refinance debt obligations as they come due. Should any of the above risks occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, well completion crews, water, equipment, supplies, personnel and field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within budget and on a timely basis.\nIn the regions in which we operate, there have been shortages of drilling rigs, well completion crews, equipment, personnel, field services, and supplies, including key components used in fracture stimulation processes such as water and proppants, as well as high costs associated with these critical components of our operations. With current technology, water is an essential component of drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. The availability of water sources and disposal facilities is becoming increasingly competitive, constrained, subject to social and regulatory scrutiny, and impacted by third-party supply chains over which we may have limited control. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to secure, transport, and use sufficient amounts of water, including limitations resulting from natural causes such as drought, could adversely impact our operations. In some cases, water may need to be obtained from new sources and transported to drilling or completion sites, resulting in increased costs.\nThe demand for qualified and experienced field service providers and associated equipment, supplies, and materials can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with commodity prices, causing periodic shortages and/or higher costs. Such shortages or higher costs could delay the execution of our drilling and development plans or cause us to incur expenditures not provided for in our capital budget or to not achieve the rates of return we are targeting for our development program, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have been an early entrant into new or emerging plays. As a result, our drilling results in these areas are uncertain, and the value of our undeveloped acreage will decline if drilling results are unsuccessful.\nWhile our costs to acquire undeveloped acreage in new or emerging plays have generally been less than those of later entrants into a developing play, our drilling results in new or emerging areas are more uncertain than drilling results in developed and producing areas. Since new or emerging plays have limited or no production history, we are unable to use past drilling results in those areas to help predict our future drilling results. As a result, our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells in these areas may be higher than initially expected, and the value of our undeveloped acreage in the emerging areas may decline if drilling results are unsuccessful.\nWe have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate.\nSome of the properties in which we have an ownership interest are operated by other companies and involve third-party working interest owners. As of December 31, 2020, non-operated properties represented 14% of our estimated proved developed reserves, 10% of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves, and 12% of our estimated total proved reserves. We have limited ability to influence or control the operations or future development of non-operated properties, including the marketing of oil and gas production, compliance with environmental, occupational safety and health and other regulations, or the amount of expenditures required to fund the development and operation of such properties. Moreover, we are dependent on other working interest owners on these projects to fund their contractual share of capital and operating expenditures. These limitations and our dependence on the operators and other working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions, divestitures, and joint development arrangements.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and will likely continue to make acquisitions of oil and gas properties, divest assets, and enter into joint development arrangements. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022recoverable reserves;\n\u2022future crude oil and natural gas prices and location and quality differentials;\n\u2022the quality of the title to acquired properties;\n\u2022future development costs, operating costs and property taxes; and\n\u2022potential environmental and other liabilities.\nThe accuracy of these acquisition assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review, which we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices, of the subject properties. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities prior to acquisition. Inspections may not always be performed on every property, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller of the subject properties may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We sometimes are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis.\nIn addition, from time to time we may sell or otherwise dispose of certain assets as a result of an evaluation of our asset portfolio or to provide cash flow for use in reducing debt and enhancing liquidity. Such divestitures have inherent risks, including possible delays in closing, the risk of lower-than-expected sales proceeds for the disposed assets, and potential post-closing adjustments and claims for indemnification. Additionally, volatility and unpredictability in commodity prices may result in fewer potential bidders, unsuccessful sales efforts, and a higher risk that buyers may seek to terminate a transaction prior to closing. The occurrence of any of the matters described above could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nVolatility in the financial markets or in global economic conditions, including consequences resulting from domestic political uncertainty, geopolitical events, international trade disputes and tariffs, and health epidemics could adversely impact our business.\nUnited States and global economies may experience periods of volatility and uncertainty from time to time, resulting in unstable consumer confidence, diminished consumer demand and spending, diminished liquidity and credit availability, and inability to access capital markets. In recent years, certain global economies have experienced periods of political uncertainty, slowing economic growth, rising interest rates, changing economic sanctions, health-related concerns, and currency volatility. These global macroeconomic conditions may have a negative impact on commodity prices and the availability and cost of materials used in our industry, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn recent years, the United States government has initiated new tariffs on certain imported goods and has imposed increases to certain existing tariffs on imported goods. In response, certain foreign governments, most notably China, imposed retaliatory tariffs on certain goods their countries import from the United States. These and other events, including the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union and the COVID-19 pandemic, have contributed to increased uncertainty for domestic and global economies. Additionally, growing trends toward populism and political polarization globally and in the U.S. have resulted in uncertainty regarding potential changes in regulations, fiscal policy, social programs, domestic and foreign relations, and government energy policies, which could pose a potential threat to domestic and global economic growth.\nTrade restrictions or other governmental actions related to tariffs or trade policies have impacted, and have the potential to further impact, our business and industry by increasing the cost of materials used in various aspects of upstream, midstream, and downstream oil and gas activities. Furthermore, tariffs and any quantitative import restrictions, particularly those impacting the cost and availability of steel and aluminum, may cause disruption in the energy industry\u2019s supply chain, resulting in the delay or cessation of drilling and completion efforts or the postponement or cancellation of new pipeline transportation projects the U.S. industry is relying on to transport its onshore production to market, as well as endangering U.S. liquefied natural gas export projects resulting in negative impacts on natural gas production. Additionally, trade and/or tariff disputes have impacted, and have the potential to further impact, domestic and global economies overall, which could result in reduced demand for crude oil and natural gas. Any of the above consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss.\nOur business and industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development and production activities. We rely heavily on digital technologies, including information systems and related infrastructure as well as cloud applications and services, to process and record financial and operating data; analyze seismic, drilling, completion and production information; manage production equipment; conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation; communicate with employees and business associates; perform compliance reporting and many other activities. The availability and integrity of these systems are essential for us to conduct our operations. Our business associates, including employees, vendors, service providers, financial institutions, and transporters, processors, and purchasers of our production are also heavily dependent on digital technology.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have also increased. Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business associates have been and continue to be the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches, which could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release or theft of confidential or protected information, corruption of data or other disruptions of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance of our systems and those of our business associates, may remain undetected for an extended period.\nA cyber attack involving our information systems and related infrastructure, and/or that of our business associates, could disrupt our business and negatively impact our operations in a variety of ways, including but not limited to unauthorized access to, or theft of, sensitive or proprietary information and data corruption or operational disruption that adversely affects our ability to carry on our business. Any such event could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business, or potential liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWhile the Company has established cyber security systems and controls, disclosure controls and procedures and incident response protocols, these systems, controls, procedures and protocols may not identify all risks and threats we face, or may fail to protect data or mitigate the adverse effects of data loss. To our knowledge we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks; however, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer material losses in the future either as a result of a breach of our systems or those of our business associates. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the growth of cyber attacks has resulted in evolving legal and compliance matters which may impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time.\nCompetition in the crude oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market crude oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel.\nOur ability to acquire additional prospects and find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, securing long-term transportation and processing capacity, marketing crude oil and natural gas, and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the crude oil and natural gas industry. Our competitors may possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources greater than ours. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive crude oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our inability to effectively compete in this environment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSevere weather events and natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSevere weather events and natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, seismic events, floods, blizzards, extreme cold, drought, and ice storms affecting the areas in which we operate, including our corporate headquarters, could have a material adverse effect on our operations or the operations of third party service providers. The consequences of such events may include the evacuation of personnel; damage to and disruption of drilling rigs or transportation, processing, storage, refining, and export facilities; the shut-in of production resulting from an inability to transport crude oil or natural gas products to market centers and other factors; an inability to access well sites; destruction of information and communication systems; and the disruption of administrative and management processes, any of which could hinder our ability to conduct normal operations and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nTerrorist activities could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks, whether domestic or foreign attacks, as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts, could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets. Continued hostilities abroad and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries could adversely affect the global economy in unpredictable ways, including the disruption of energy supplies and markets, increased volatility in commodity prices or the possibility that infrastructure we rely on could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFinancial Risks\nOur derivative activities could result in financial losses or reduce our earnings.\nTo achieve more predictable cash flows and reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, from time to time we may enter into derivative instruments for a potentially significant portion of our production. See Part II, Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 5. Derivative Instruments for a summary of our commodity derivative positions as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, see Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Derivative Instruments for a summary of additional derivative instruments entered into subsequent to December 31, 2020. We do not designate our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes and we record all derivatives on our balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate materially as a result of changes in commodity prices and resulting changes in the fair value of any outstanding derivatives.\nDerivative instruments expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including when:\n\u2022production is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments;\n\u2022the counterparty to the derivative instrument defaults on its contractual obligations; or\n\u2022there is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received.\nIn addition, derivative arrangements limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in commodity prices. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our future production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions and our desire to stabilize cash flows necessary for the development of our proved reserves. We may choose not to hedge future production if the pricing environment for certain time periods is deemed to be unfavorable. Additionally, we may choose to liquidate derivative positions prior to the expiration of their contractual maturities in order to monetize gain positions for the purpose of funding our capital program or other business opportunities.\nOur revolving credit facility and indentures for our senior notes contain certain covenants and restrictions that may inhibit our ability to make certain investments, incur additional indebtedness and engage in certain other transactions, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our goals.\nOur revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets. Our revolving credit facility also contains a requirement that we maintain a consolidated net debt to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. This ratio represents the ratio of net debt (calculated as total face value of debt plus outstanding letters of credit less cash and cash equivalents) divided by the sum of net debt plus total shareholders\u2019 equity plus, to the extent resulting in a reduction of total shareholders\u2019 equity, the amount of any non-cash impairment charges incurred, net of any tax effect, after June 30, 2014. At December 31, 2020, we had $160 million of outstanding borrowings on our credit facility and our consolidated net debt to total capitalization ratio, as defined, was 0.42 to 1.00.\nThe indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to create liens securing certain indebtedness, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidate, merge or transfer certain assets.\nThe covenants in our revolving credit facility and senior note indentures may restrict our ability to expand or pursue our business strategies. Our ability to comply with the provisions of our revolving credit facility or senior note indentures may be impacted by changes in economic or business conditions, results of operations, or events beyond our control. The breach of any covenant could result in a default under our revolving credit facility or senior note indentures, in which case, depending on the actions taken by the lenders or trustees thereunder or their successors or assignees, could result in all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be due and payable. If our indebtedness is accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full such indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe inability of joint interest owners, significant customers, and service providers to meet their obligations to us may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur principal exposure to credit risk is through the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production, which we market to energy marketing companies, crude oil refining companies, and natural gas gathering and processing companies ($561 million in receivables at December 31, 2020) and our joint interest and other receivables ($144 million at December 31, 2020). These counterparties may experience insolvency or liquidity issues and may not be able to meet their obligations and liabilities owed to us, particularly during a period of depressed commodity prices. Defaults by these counterparties could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we rely on field service companies and midstream companies for services associated with the drilling and completion of wells and for certain midstream services. A worsening of the commodity price environment may result in a material adverse impact on the liquidity and financial position of the parties with whom we do business, resulting in delays in payment of, or non-payment of, amounts owed to us, delays in operations, loss of access to equipment and facilities and similar impacts. These events could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nLaws, regulations, guidance, executive actions or other regulatory initiatives regarding environmental protection and occupational safety and health could increase our costs of doing business and result in operating restrictions, delays, or cancellations in the drilling and completion of crude oil and natural gas wells, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur crude oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local legal requirements governing environmental protection and occupational safety and health. These requirements may take the form of laws, regulations, executive actions and various other legal initiatives. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Regulation of the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Industry for a discussion of those environmental and occupational safety and health legal requirements that govern us, including with respect to air emissions, including natural gas flaring limitations and ozone standards; climate change, including restriction of methane or other greenhouse gas emissions and suspensions of new leasing and permitting on federal lands and waters; elimination of subsidies for the oil and gas sector; hydraulic fracturing; waste water disposal regulatory developments; occupational safety standards, and other risks or regulations relating to environmental protection. One or more of these legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to certain complex federal, state and local laws and regulations in areas other than environmental protection and occupational safety and health that could result in increased costs, operating restrictions or delays, limitations or prohibitions on our ability to develop and produce reserves, or expose us to significant liabilities.\nOur crude oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations in areas other than environmental protection and occupational safety and health, including with respect to production, sales and transport of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, and employees and labor relations. Following is a discussion of certain significant laws, rules and regulations that affect us in these areas in which we operate. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Regulation of the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Industry for further discussion of the regulations that affect us.\nTaxation of oil and gas activities-In previous years, legislation has been proposed to eliminate or defer certain key U.S. federal income tax deductions historically available to oil and gas exploration and production companies. Such proposed changes have included: (i) a repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for crude oil and natural gas properties; (ii) the elimination of deductions for intangible drilling and exploration and development costs; (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain production activities; and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. With President Biden taking office and the control of Congress shifting in January 2021, there is an increased risk of the enactment of legislation that alters, eliminates, or defers these or other tax deductions utilized within our industry, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDodd-Frank Act derivative regulations-In 2010, the U.S. Congress adopted the Dodd-Frank Act, which, among other provisions, established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market. If we do not qualify for an end user exemption from the Dodd-Frank Act requirements, the regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure existing derivative contracts, lead to fewer potential counterparties, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties, any of which could limit our desire and ability to implement commodity price risk management strategies. Certain other regulations, including regulations related to capital requirements, which are yet to be implemented, may have an effect that results in the reduction of the number of products and counterparties in the over-the-counter derivatives market available to us and could result in significant additional costs being passed through to us. If our use of derivatives becomes limited as a result of the regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable. Aspects of the Dodd-Frank rulemaking have been finalized in certain areas, but other areas have not been finalized or implemented and the ultimate effect of these regulations on our business remains uncertain.\nFailure to comply with the above and other laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement investigations or actions, including investigatory actions, the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements, the issuance of orders or judgments limiting or enjoining future operations, criminal sanctions, or litigation. Moreover, changes to existing laws or regulations or changes in interpretations of laws and regulations may\nunfavorably impact us or the infrastructure used for transporting our products. Similarly, changes in regulatory policies and priorities, including those in response to the January 2021 change in U.S. presidential administrations and shift in control of Congress, could result in the imposition of new laws or regulations that adversely impact us or our industry. Any such changes could increase our operating costs, delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nClimate change activism, energy conservation measures, or initiatives that stimulate demand for alternative forms of energy could reduce the demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce.\nClimate change activism, fuel conservation measures, governmental requirements for renewable energy resources, increasing consumer demand for alternative forms of energy, and technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices may create new competitive conditions that result in reduced demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce. The potential impact of changing demand for crude oil and natural gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Regulation of the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Industry for further discussion relating to climate change and emission of greenhouse gases, climate change activism, energy conservation measures or initiatives that stimulate demand for alternative forms of energy. One or more of these developments could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.\nWe are involved in legal proceedings that could result in substantial liabilities.\nLike other similarly-situated oil and gas companies, we are, from time to time, involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business including, but not limited to, commercial disputes, claims from royalty and surface owners, property damage claims, personal injury claims, regulatory compliance matters, disputes with tax authorities, and other matters. The outcome of such legal matters often cannot be predicted with certainty. We vigorously defend ourselves in all such matters. However, if our efforts to defend ourselves are not successful, it is possible the outcome of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial liability, penalties, sanctions, judgments, consent decrees, or orders requiring a change in our business practices, which could have a material adverse on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Judgments and estimates to determine accruals related to legal and other proceedings could change from period to period, and such changes could be material.\nIncreasing attention to environmental, social, and corporate governance matters may impact our business.\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to their environmental, social, and corporate governance (\u201cESG\u201d) practices. These standards are evolving and if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to certain standards, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, we may suffer from reputational damage and our business, financial condition, and/or stock price could be materially and adversely affected. Increasing attention to climate change, increasing societal expectations on companies to address climate change, and potential consumer use of alternative forms of energy may result in increased costs, reduced demand for hydrocarbon products, reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation, and negative impacts on our stock price, our ability to recruit necessary talent, and our access to capital markets.\nIn addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Currently, there are no universal standards for such scores or ratings and, in fact, different standards focus, to varying degrees, on different attributes of environmental, social, and corporate governance matters. This disparity between the \u201cstandards\u201d may result in investors focusing on inadequate or improper metrics which may lead to a misperception of a company and its ESG practices. Nonetheless, the importance of sustainability evaluations is becoming more broadly accepted by investors and shareholders. ESG ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Additionally, certain investors use these scores to benchmark companies against their peers, and if a company is perceived as lagging, these investors may engage with companies to require improved ESG disclosure or performance. Moreover, certain members of the broader investment community may consider a company\u2019s sustainability score as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision. Consequently, a low sustainability score could result in exclusion of our stock from consideration by certain investment funds, engagement by investors seeking to improve such scores and a negative perception of our operations by certain investors.\nRisks Related to our Corporate Structure\nOur Executive Chairman beneficially owns approximately 81% of our outstanding common stock, giving him influence and control in corporate transactions and other matters, including a sale of our Company.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Harold G. Hamm, our Executive Chairman, beneficially owned approximately 81% of our outstanding common shares. As a result, Mr. Hamm has control over our Company and will continue to be able to control the\nelection of our directors, determine our corporate and management policies and determine, without the consent of our other shareholders, the outcome of certain corporate transactions or other matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales and other significant corporate transactions. Therefore, Mr. Hamm could cause, delay or prevent a change of control of our Company. The interests of Mr. Hamm may not coincide with the interests of other holders of our common stock.\nWe have historically entered into, and may enter into, transactions from time to time with companies or persons affiliated with Mr. Hamm if, after an independent review by our Audit Committee or by the independent members of our Board of Directors, it is determined such transactions are in the Company\u2019s best interests and are on terms no less favorable to us than could be achieved with an unaffiliated third party. These transactions may result in conflicts of interest between Mr. Hamm\u2019s affiliated parties and us.", "PERMNO": 91983, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CLR"}
