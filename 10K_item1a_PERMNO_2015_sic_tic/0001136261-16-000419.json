RISK FACTORS\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected and the value of our securities could be negatively impacted. Although we believe that we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known that may materially adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to our Acquisition Strategy and Managing Growth\nWe may not be able to continue to grow through acquisitions of businesses and assets.\nWe have sought growth largely through acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Zohydro ER product line in 2015, the rights to Treximet intellectual property in 2014, Pernix Sleep in 2013 and Cypress in 2012. As part of our ongoing expansion strategy, we plan to make additional strategic acquisitions of assets and businesses. However, our credit agreement with Wells Fargo and the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain restrictive covenants, which include, among other things, restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness, as well as certain consolidations, acquisitions, mergers, purchases or sales of assets and capital expenditures, subject to certain exceptions and permissions limited in scope and dollar value, among other things. In addition to these restrictive covenants our credit agreement with Wells Fargo contains certain financial covenants. For additional information see the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We cannot assure you that acquisitions will be available on terms attractive to us. Moreover, we cannot assure you that such acquisitions will be permissible under our existing credit agreement with Wells Fargo or the indentures governing our outstanding notes or that we will be able to arrange financing on terms acceptable to us or to obtain timely federal and state governmental approvals on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate newly acquired businesses or assets and realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions.\n\tManagement has in the past devoted, and will in the future devote, significant attention and resources to integrating newly acquired businesses and assets. Potential difficulties we have or may in the future encounter in the integration process include the following:\nthe inability to successfully combine our businesses with any newly acquired business, to integrate any newly acquired assets into our existing product portfolio, and to meet our capital requirements following such acquisition, in a manner that permits us to achieve the cost savings or revenue enhancements anticipated to result from these acquisitions, which would result in the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;\nlost sales and customers as a result of certain customers of Pernix or the newly acquired business or asset deciding not to do business with us following such acquisition;\nthe additional complexities of integrating newly acquired businesses and assets with different core products and markets;\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses associated with an acquisition of a business or asset; and\nperformance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management's attention caused by integrating the operations of a newly acquired business with those of Pernix or a newly acquired asset into the existing product portfolio.\nFor all these reasons, you should be aware that it is possible that integrating a newly acquired business or asset could result in the distraction of our management, the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in our products, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions, or could otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations.\nOur acquisitions of Cypress, Somaxon, the rights to Treximet intellectual property and the Zohydro product line significantly changed the composition of our operations, markets and product mix. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to address these changes, and, where necessary, to attract and retain new personnel that possess the requisite skills called for by these changes.\nWe may continue to expand our operations through additional acquisitions, license arrangements, other strategic transactions and new product offerings. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage our expansion opportunities. Integrating new operations into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner, successfully monitoring our operations, costs, regulatory compliance and customer relationships, and maintaining other necessary internal controls pose substantial challenges for us. As a result, we cannot assure you that our expansion or acquisition opportunities will be successful, or that we will realize our expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies or other benefits.\nOur business operations and financial position could be adversely affected as a result of our substantial indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2015, after giving effect to our issuance of an aggregate of $130.0 million of 4.25% Convertible Notes, our outstanding Wells Fargo Credit Facility of $15.0 million and an aggregate of $210.0 million of Treximet Secured Notes in August 2014, we had approximately $328.8 million of debt outstanding and the ability to borrow approximately $15.3 million under our credit agreement with Wells Fargo, subject to borrowing base capacity. This significant indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it may:\nmake it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding notes, the credit agreement with Wells Fargo and our other indebtedness and contractual and commercial commitments;\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions, entering new markets or exploiting business opportunities;\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionally less debt;\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds and/or leverage our cost of borrowing; and\ndecrease our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIn the event our capital resources are otherwise insufficient to meet future capital requirements and operating expenses, we may seek to finance our cash needs through public or private equity or debt financings, strategic relationships, including the divestiture of non-core assets, assigning receivables, milestone payments or royalty rights, or other arrangements. Securing additional financing will require a substantial amount of time and attention from our management and may divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our management's ability to conduct our day-to-day operations. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may be required to:\nsignificantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our products and product candidates;\nseek collaborators for one or more of our current or future products or product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; or\nrelinquish or license on unfavorable terms, our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.\nAdditional equity or debt financing, or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements, may not be permissible under the indentures governing our outstanding notes or the credit agreement with Wells Fargo or otherwise available on acceptable terms, if at all. Additional equity financing will be dilutive to stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve additional restrictive covenants. Any exploration of strategic alternatives may not result in an agreement or transaction and, if completed, any agreement or transaction may not be successful or on attractive terms. The inability to enter into a strategic transaction, or a strategic transaction that is not successful or on attractive terms, could accelerate our need for cash and make securing funding on reasonable terms more difficult. In addition, if we raise additional funds through collaborations or other strategic transactions, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our potential products or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nDespite our significant level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt, which could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although certain of our agreements, including the credit agreement with Wells Fargo and the indentures governing our outstanding notes limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to waiver and a number of qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, debt incurred following receipt of a waiver or in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the risks associated with our substantial leverage described herein, including our possible inability to service our debt, would increase.\nOur debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow.\nA higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, we may have to delay or curtail our operations.\nOur ability to generate cash flows from operations and to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness will depend on our future financial performance. Our future financial performance will be affected by a range of economic, competitive and business factors that we cannot control, such as those risks described in this section. A significant reduction in operating cash flows resulting from changes in economic conditions, increased competition or other events beyond our control could increase the need for additional or alternative sources of liquidity and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and our ability to service our debt and other obligations. If we are unable to service our indebtedness we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include actions such as reducing capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital. These alternative strategies may not be effected on satisfactory terms, if at all, and they may not yield sufficient funds to make required payments on our indebtedness.\nIf for any reason we are unable to meet our debt service and repayment obligations, we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing our debt, which may allow our creditors at that time to declare outstanding indebtedness to be due and payable, which would in turn trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default rights between the relevant agreements.\nIn addition, the borrowings under our credit agreement with Wells Fargo bear interest at variable rates and other debt we incur could likewise be variable-rate debt. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed thereunder remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease.\nThe indentures governing our outstanding notes and the credit agreement with Wells Fargo impose significant operating and/or financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries that may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and restrict our ability to operate our business.\nThe indentures governing our outstanding notes and the credit agreement with Wells Fargo contain covenants that restrict our and our subsidiaries' ability to take various actions, such as:\nincur additional debt;\npay dividends and make distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, their capital stock;\nmake certain investments, purchase certain assets or other restricted payments;\nsell assets, including in connection with sale-leaseback transactions;\ncreate liens;\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\nmake lease payments in exceeding a specified amount; and\nmerge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of their assets.\nIn addition, the terms of the Treximet Secured Notes require us to maintain a minimum liquidity of $8.0 million at all times.\nUpon the occurrence of a fundamental change, as described in the indenture governing the 4.25% Convertible Notes, holders of the 4.25% Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of their 4.25% Convertible Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 4.25% Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. If a holder elects to convert its 4.25% Convertible Notes for shares in excess of the conversion cap, as described in the indenture governing the 4.25% Convertible Notes, we will be obligated to deliver cash in lieu of any share that was not delivered on account of such limitation. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the 4.25% Convertible Notes surrendered therefor in connection with a fundamental change or payments of cash on 4.25% Convertible Notes converted in excess of the conversion cap. In addition, our ability to repurchase the 4.25% Convertible Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the 4.25% Convertible Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the 4.25% Convertible Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the 4.25% Convertible Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture could also lead to a default under agreements governing our other outstanding indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the 4.25% Convertible Notes or make cash payments upon conversions as required by the indenture.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants will likely be affected by many factors, including events beyond our control, and we may not satisfy those requirements. Our failure to comply with our debt-related obligations could result in an event of default under the particular debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the indebtedness under that instrument and, in some cases, the acceleration of our other indebtedness, in whole or in part.\nThese restrictions will also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nOur ability to borrow under the credit agreement with Wells Fargo is limited by the amount of our borrowing base. Any negative impact on the elements of our borrowing base, such as accounts receivable and inventory could reduce our borrowing capacity under the credit agreement with Wells Fargo.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize our products.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified managerial personnel. We are highly dependent upon our executive management team, particularly Douglas Drysdale, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of Mr. Drysdale or any one or more other members of our executive management team or other key personnel could delay or prevent the successful completion of some of our development and commercialization objectives.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified sales and marketing personnel is critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nOur management devotes substantial time to comply with public company regulations.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the NASDAQ Global Market, impose various requirements on public companies, including with respect to corporate governance practices. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nIn addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that our management maintain adequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and, as applicable, our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our compliance with Section 404 will require us to incur substantial accounting and related expenses and expend significant management efforts. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, our financial reporting could be unreliable and misinformation could be disseminated to the public.\nAny failure to develop or maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving our internal control over financial reporting could harm our operating results and prevent us from meeting our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls also could cause our stockholders and potential investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, investors relying upon this misinformation could make an uninformed investment decision and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, NASDAQ Global Market or other regulatory authorities, or to stockholder class action securities litigation.\nOur April 2015 acquisition of Zohydro ER and the August 2014 acquisition of the rights to Treximet intellectual property and our strategy of obtaining, through asset acquisitions and in-licenses, rights to other products and product candidates for our development pipeline and to proprietary drug delivery and formulation technologies for our life cycle management of current products may not be successful.\nWe acquired the rights to Zohydro ER in April 2015 and Treximet intellectual property in August 2014 and from time to time we may seek to engage in additional strategic transactions with third parties to acquire rights to other pharmaceutical products, pharmaceutical product candidates in the late stages of development and proprietary drug delivery and formulation technologies. Because we do not have discovery and research capabilities, the growth of our business will depend in significant part on our ability to acquire or in-license additional products, product candidates or proprietary drug delivery and formulation technologies that we believe have significant commercial potential and are consistent with our commercial objectives. However, we may be unable to license or acquire suitable products, product candidates or technologies from third parties for a number of reasons.\nThe licensing and acquisition of pharmaceutical products, product candidates and related technologies is a competitive area. A number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire products, product candidates and drug delivery and formulation technologies, which may mean fewer suitable acquisition opportunities for us as well as higher acquisition prices. Many of our competitors have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities.\nOther factors that may prevent us from licensing or otherwise acquiring suitable products, product candidates or technologies include:\nwe may be unable to license or acquire the relevant products, product candidates or technologies on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on investment;\ncompanies that perceive us as a competitor may be unwilling to license or sell their product rights or technologies to us;\nwe may be unable to identify suitable products, product candidates or technologies within our areas of expertise; and\nwe may have inadequate cash resources or may be unable to obtain financing to acquire rights to suitable products, product candidates or technologies from third parties.\nIf we are unable to successfully identify and acquire rights to products, product candidates and proprietary drug delivery and formulation technologies and successfully integrate them into our operations, we may not be able to increase our revenues in future periods, which could result in significant harm to our financial condition, results of operations and development prospects.\nIf we fail to successfully manage any acquisitions, our ability to develop our product candidates and expand our product pipeline may be harmed.\nOur failure to adequately address the financial, operational or legal risks of any acquisitions or in-license arrangements could harm our business. Financial aspects of these transactions that could alter our financial position, reported operating results or stock price include:\nuse of cash resources;\nhigher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses;\npotentially dilutive issuances of equity securities;\nthe incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, impairment losses or restructuring charges;\nlarge write-offs and difficulties in assessing the relative percentages of in-process research and development expense that can be immediately written off as compared to the amount that must be amortized over the appropriate life of the asset; and\namortization expenses related to other intangible assets.\nOperational risks that could harm our existing operations or prevent realization of anticipated benefits from these transactions include:\nchallenges associated with managing an increasingly diversified business;\ndisruption of our ongoing business;\ndifficulty and expense in assimilating the operations, products, technology, information systems or personnel of the acquired company;\ndiversion of management's time and attention from other business concerns;\nentry into a geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience;\ninability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\nthe assumption of known and unknown liabilities of the acquired business or asset, including intellectual property claims; and\nsubsequent loss of key personnel.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage our acquisitions, our ability to develop and commercialize new products and continue to expand our product pipeline may be limited.\nIf we are unable to effectively train and equip our sales force to sell newly acquired and existing products, our ability to successfully commercialize our products will be harmed.\nWe have in the past made, and may in the future continue to make, acquisitions of pharmaceutical products. We have also experienced, and expect to continue to experience, turnover of some of our sales representatives that we hired or will hire, requiring us to train new sales representatives. The members of our sales force may have no prior experience promoting the pharmaceutical products that we own or may acquire in the future. As a result, we expend significant time and resources to train our sales force to be credible and persuasive in convincing physicians to prescribe and pharmacists to dispense these pharmaceutical products. In addition, we must train our sales force to ensure that a consistent and appropriate message about\nour products is being delivered to our potential customers. Our sales representatives may also experience challenges promoting multiple products when they call on physicians and their office staff. If we are unable to effectively train our sales force and equip them with effective materials relating to our pharmaceutical products, including medical and sales literature to help them inform and educate potential customers about the benefits of such products and their proper administration and label indication, our efforts to successfully market these pharmaceutical products could be put in jeopardy, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, stock price and operations.\nRisks Related to Commercialization\nThe commercial success of our currently marketed products and any additional products that we successfully commercialize will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community.\nAny products that we bring to the market may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community. If our products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue and may not be profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our products depends on a number of factors, including:\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effect;\nthe efficacy and potential advantages over the alternative treatments;\nthe ability to offer our branded products for sale at competitive prices, including in relation to any generic products;\nsubstitution of our branded products with generic equivalents at the pharmacy level;\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support; and\nsufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement.\nWe face competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than us.\nThe development and commercialization of drugs is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our currently marketed products and any products that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. Our competitors include major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other private and public research organizations that seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for development, manufacturing and commercialization. We face significant competition for our currently marketed products. Some of our currently marketed branded products, including Zutripro, Rezira and Vituz, do not have patent protection and in most cases face generic competition. All of our products face significant price competition from a range of branded and generic products for the same therapeutic indications.\nSome or all of our product candidates, if approved, may face competition from other branded and generic drugs approved for the same therapeutic indications, approved drugs used off label for such indications and novel drugs in clinical development. For example, our product candidates may not demonstrate sufficient additional clinical benefits to physicians to justify a higher price compared to other lower cost products within the same therapeutic class. Notwithstanding the fact that we may devote substantial amounts of our resources to bringing product candidates to market, our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop and/or commercialize.\nOur patent rights may not protect our patent-protected products and product candidates if competitors devise ways of making products that compete with us without legally infringing our patent rights. For example, our patent rights in Silenor are limited in ways that affect our ability to exclude third parties from competing against us. In particular, we do not hold composition of matter patents covering the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, of Silenor. Composition of matter patents on APIs are a particularly effective form of intellectual property protection for pharmaceutical products, as they apply without regard to any method of use or other type of limitation. As a result, competitors who obtain the requisite regulatory approval can offer products with the same API as Silenor so long as the competitors do not infringe any method of use or formulations patents that we may hold.\nThe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"FDCA\") and FDA regulations and policies provide certain exclusivity incentives to manufacturers to create modified, non-infringing versions of a drug in order to facilitate the approval of abbreviated new drug applications (\"ANDAs\") for generic substitutes. These same types of exclusivity incentives encourage manufacturers to submit new drug applications (\"NDAs\") that rely, in part, on literature and clinical data not prepared for or by such manufacturers. Manufacturers might only be required to conduct a relatively inexpensive study to show that their product has the same API, dosage form, strength, route of administration and conditions of use or labeling as our product and that the generic product is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent as our product, a comparison known as bioequivalence. Such products would be significantly less costly than certain of our products to bring to market and could lead to the existence of multiple lower-priced competitive products, which would substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments we have made in those products. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our product candidates.\nProducts in our portfolio that do not have patent protection are potentially at risk for generic competition. We utilize our generic business to attempt to retain market share from other generic competitors for our branded products. For example, we have attempted to maintain market share in the prescription cough and cold market by offering an authorized generic of Cedax and Zutripro. Additionally, products we sell through our collaborative or co-promotion arrangements may also face competition in the marketplace.\nSome of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we have and superior expertise in marketing and sales, research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products and thus may be better equipped than us to discover, develop, manufacture and commercialize products. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified management personnel and acquiring technologies. Many of our competitors have collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions. In many cases, products that compete with our products have already received regulatory approval or are in late-stage development, have well-known brand names, are distributed by large pharmaceutical companies with substantial resources and have achieved widespread acceptance among physicians and patients. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.\nWe will face competition based on the safety and effectiveness of our products, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, the availability and cost of supply, marketing and sales capabilities, reimbursement coverage, price, patent position and other factors. Our competitors may develop or commercialize more effective, safer or more affordable products, or products with more effective patent protection, than our products. Accordingly, our competitors may commercialize products more rapidly or effectively than we are able to, which would adversely affect our competitive position, our revenue and profit from existing products and anticipated revenue and profit from product candidates. If our products or product candidates are rendered noncompetitive, we may not be able to recover the expenses of developing and commercializing those products or product candidates.\nIf our competitors introduce their own generic equivalents of our products, our net revenues from such products are expected to decline.\nProduct sales of generic pharmaceutical products often follow a particular pattern over time based on regulatory and competitive factors. The first company to introduce a generic equivalent of a branded product is often able to capture a substantial share of the market. However, as other companies introduce competing generic products, the first entrant's market share, and the price of its generic product, will typically decline. The extent of the decline generally depends on several factors, including the number of competitors, the price of the branded product and the pricing strategy of the new competitors.\nFor example, in the generic drug industry, when a company is the first to introduce a generic drug, the pricing of the generic drug is typically set based on a discount from the published price of the equivalent branded product. Other generic manufacturers may enter the market and, as a result, the price of the drug may decline significantly. In such event, we may in our discretion provide our customers a credit with respect to the customers' remaining inventory for the difference between our new price and the price at which we originally sold the product to our customers. There are circumstances under which we may, as a matter of business strategy, not provide price adjustments to certain customers and, consequently, we may lose future sales to competitors.\nNegative publicity regarding any of our products or product candidates could delay or impair our ability to market any such product, delay or prevent approval of any such product candidate and may require us to spend time and money to address these issues.\nIf any of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies prove to be, or are asserted to be, harmful to consumers and/or subject to FDA enforcement action, our ability to successfully market and sell our products could be impaired. Because of our dependence on patient and physician perceptions, any adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting from the use or misuse of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies could limit the commercial potential of our products and expose us to potential liabilities.\nIf we are unable to attract, hire and retain qualified sales and management personnel and successfully manage our sales and marketing programs and resources, or if our commercial partners do not adequately perform, the commercial opportunity for our products may be diminished.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our sales force consisted of approximately 200 sales territories. In August 2015, we entered into an agreement with Poly Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for services related to the promotion of Cedax and its authorized generic.\nWe and any other commercialization partner we engage may not be able to attract, hire, train and retain qualified sales and sales management personnel in the future. If we or they are not successful in maintaining an effective number of qualified sales personnel, our ability to effectively market and promote our products may be impaired. Even if we are able to effectively maintain such sales personnel, their efforts may not be successful in commercializing our products.\nIn addition, a significant portion of revenues we receive from sales of products that are the subject to commercial partnerships will largely depend upon the efforts our partners. The efforts of our partners in many instances are likely to be outside our control. If we are unable to maintain our commercial partnerships or to effectively establish alternative arrangements for our products, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, despite our arrangements with our other partners, we still may not be able to cover all of the prescribing physicians for our products at the same level of reach and frequency as our competitors, and we ultimately may need to further expand our selling efforts in order to effectively compete.\nThe efforts of our sales force and partners are complemented by on-line and other non-personal promotional initiatives that target both physicians and patients. We are also focused on ensuring broad patient access to our products by negotiating agreements with leading commercial managed care organizations and with government payors. Although our goal is to achieve sales through the efficient execution of our sales and marketing plans and programs, we may not be able to effectively generate prescriptions and achieve broad market acceptance for our products on a timely basis, or at all.\nA failure to maintain optimal inventory levels to meet commercial demand for our products could harm our reputation and subject us to financial losses.\nSome of our products, including Zohydro ER with BeadTek, Zutripro, its generic equivalent, Rezira, Vituz and certain other generic products contain controlled substances, which are regulated by the DEA under the Controlled Substances Act. DEA quota requirements limit the amount of controlled substance drug products a manufacturer can manufacture and the amount of API it can use to manufacture those products. We may experience difficulties obtaining raw materials needed to manufacture our products as a result of DEA regulations and because of the limited number of suppliers of pseudoephedrine, an active ingredient in several of our products. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining quotas, unable to manufacture and release inventory on a timely and consistent basis, fail to maintain an adequate level of product inventory, or if inventory is destroyed or damaged or reaches its expiration date, patients might not have access to our products, our reputation and our brands could be harmed and physicians may be less likely to prescribe our products in the future, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe and our contract manufacturers may not be able to obtain the regulatory approvals or clearances that are necessary to manufacture pharmaceutical products.\nBefore approving a new drug or biologic product, the FDA requires that the facilities at which the product will be manufactured be in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, which we refer to herein as cGMP, requirements which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance, as well as the maintenance of records and documentation and utilization of qualified raw materials. To be successful, our products must be manufactured for development and, following approval, in commercial quantities, in compliance with regulatory requirements and at acceptable costs.\nWe and our contract manufacturers must comply with these cGMP requirements. While we believe that we and our contract manufacturers currently meet these requirements, we cannot assure that our manufacturing facilities or those of our contract manufacturers will continue to meet cGMP requirements or will be sufficient to manufacture all of our needs and/or the needs of our customers for commercial materials.\nWe and our contract manufacturers may also encounter problems with the following:\nproduction yields;\npossible facility contamination;\nquality control and quality assurance programs;\nshortages of qualified personnel;\ncompliance with FDA or other regulatory authorities' regulations, including the demonstration of purity and potency;\nchanges in FDA or other regulatory authorities' requirements;\nproduction costs; and/or\ndevelopment of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls.\nIn addition, we and our contract manufacturers are required to register our manufacturing facilities with the FDA and other regulatory authorities and to subject them to inspections confirming compliance with cGMP or other regulations. If we or our contract manufacturers fail to maintain regulatory compliance, the FDA can impose regulatory sanctions including, among other things, refusal to permit us or our contract manufacturers to continue manufacturing approved products. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nIf we or our third party manufacturers fail to comply with regulatory requirements for our controlled substance products, the DEA may take regulatory actions detrimental to our business, resulting in temporary or permanent interruption of distribution, withdrawal of products from the market or other penalties.\nWe, our third party manufacturers and certain of our products including Zohydro, Zutripro, its generic equivalent, Rezira, Vituz and certain other generic products are subject to the Controlled Substances Act and DEA regulations thereunder. Accordingly, we must adhere to a number of requirements with respect to our controlled substance products including registration, recordkeeping and reporting requirements; labeling and packaging requirements; security controls, procurement and manufacturing quotas; and certain restrictions on refills. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the sale of our currently marketed products and any other products that we successfully develop or commercialize. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our products or product candidates caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\ndecreased demand for our products or any products that we may develop;\ninjury to reputation;\nwithdrawal of client trial participants;\nwithdrawal of a product from the market;\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\ndiversion of management time and attention;\nloss of revenue; and\nthe inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nThe amount of insurance that we currently hold may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost and we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our financial results.\nWe generally experience some effects of seasonality due to increases in demand for cough and cold products during the winter season. Accordingly, sales of cough and cold products and associated revenue have generally increased at a higher rate immediately prior and during the winter season. This seasonality may cause fluctuations in our financial results. In addition, other seasonality trends may develop and the existing seasonality that we experience may change.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nIf the manufacturers upon whom we rely fail to produce our products in the volumes that we require on a timely basis, or to comply with stringent regulations applicable to pharmaceutical drug manufacturers, we may face delays in the development and commercialization of, or be unable to meet demand for, our products and may lose potential revenues.\nWe do not manufacture our marketed products, and we do not currently plan to develop any capacity to do so. We rely on third party manufacturers for our products. The manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up and validating initial production. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product and quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. Our manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may terminate their agreements with us. Additionally, our manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes or unstable political environments. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties, or otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations, our ability to sell our marketed products or any other product candidate that we commercialize would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in our ability to meet commercial demand for our marketed products will result in the loss of potential revenues.\nIn connection with our acquisition of the rights to Treximet intellectual property in August 2014, we discovered short-term supply constraints for the product. Our failure to obtain sufficient supply of Treximet to meet anticipated demand in the future may result in the loss of potential revenues.\nAll manufacturers of pharmaceutical products must comply with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA is also likely to conduct inspections of our manufacturers' facilities as part of their review of any marketing applications we submit. These cGMP requirements include quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our products may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with other FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements. A failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety of any quantities supplied is compromised due to our manufacturers' failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our products.\nMoreover, our manufacturers and suppliers may experience difficulties related to their overall businesses and financial stability, which could result in delays or interruptions of our supply of our marketed products. We do not have alternate manufacturing plans in place at this time. If we need to change to other manufacturers, the FDA and comparable foreign regulators must approve these manufacturers' facilities and processes prior to our use, which would require new testing and compliance inspections, and the new manufacturers would have to be educated in or independently develop the processes necessary for production.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect the commercial activities for our marketed products, and required approvals for any other product candidate that we develop, or entail higher costs or result in our being unable to effectively commercialize our products. Furthermore, if our manufacturers failed to deliver the required commercial quantities of raw materials, including bulk drug substance, or finished product on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, we would likely be unable to meet demand for our products and we would lose potential revenues.\nThe concentration of our product sales to only a few wholesale distributors increases the risk that we will not be able to effectively distribute our products if we need to replace any of these customers, which would cause our sales to decline.\nThe majority of our sales are to a small number of pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, which in turn sell our products primarily to retail pharmacies, which ultimately dispense our products to the end consumers. For the year ended December 31, 2015, McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation accounted for 38%, 28% and 27%, respectively, of our total gross sales. For the year ended December 31, 2014, McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation and Cardinal Health accounted for 37%, 31% and 23%, respectively, of our total gross sales. For the year ended December 31, 2013, McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation and Cardinal Health accounted for 35%, 20% and 24%, respectively, of our total gross sales.\nIf any of these customers cease doing business with us or materially reduce the amount of product they purchase from us and we cannot conclude agreements with replacement wholesale distributors on commercially reasonable terms, we might not be able to effectively distribute our products through retail pharmacies. The possibility of this occurring is exacerbated by the recent significant consolidation in the wholesale drug distribution industry, including through mergers and acquisitions among wholesale distributors and the growth of large retail drugstore chains. As a result, a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market.\nAny collaboration arrangements that we enter into may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nWe enter into collaboration arrangements from time to time on a selective basis. Our collaborations may not be successful. Of our current product portfolio, we market Khedezla, Cedax, Zutripro, Rezira, Vituz and certain of our generic products pursuant to collaboration arrangements. The success of our collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators. Collaborators generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations.\nDisagreements between parties to a collaboration arrangement regarding clinical development and commercialization matters can lead to delays in the development process or commercialization of the applicable product candidate and, in some cases, termination of the collaboration arrangement. These disagreements can be difficult to resolve if neither of the parties has final decision making authority.\nOur business could suffer as a result of a failure to manage and maintain our distribution network with our wholesale customers.\nWe depend on the distribution abilities of our wholesale customers to ensure that our products are effectively distributed through the supply chain. If there are any interruptions in our customers' ability to distribute products through their distribution centers, our products may not be effectively distributed, which could cause confusion and frustration among pharmacists and lead to product substitution.\nWe intend to rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of such trials.\nWe do not intend to independently conduct clinical trials for our product candidates. We will rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to perform this function. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities. We are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices, for conducting, recording, and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. Furthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, regulatory approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings and business disputes that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings and business disputes and additional claims may arise in the future. In particular, as of December 31, 2015, GSK has claimed aggregate damages of approximately $32.0 million stemming from an alleged breach of a covenant contained in the Asset Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we purchased the Treximet assets pertaining to a pre-existing customer agreement. We have an escrow of $5.7 million against potential liability in this suit. Our dispute with GSK and other legal proceedings and disputes that may arise in the future may be complex and extended and may occupy the resources of our management and employees. These proceedings may also be costly to prosecute and defend and may involve substantial awards or damages payable by us if not found in our favor. We may also be required to pay substantial amounts or grant certain rights on unfavorable terms in order to settle such proceedings. Defending against or settling such claims and any unfavorable legal decisions, settlements or orders could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline. For more information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies, see Note 22, Commitments and Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain protection for the intellectual property relating to our technology and products, the value of our technology and products will be adversely affected.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection for the intellectual property covering or incorporated into our technology and products. The patent situation in the field of pharmaceuticals is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and scientific questions. We rely upon patents, trademarks, trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology and products. We may not be able to obtain additional patent rights relating to our technology or products and pending patent applications to which we have rights may not issue as patents or if issued, may not issue in a form that will be advantageous to us. Even if issued, any patents issued to us or licensed to us may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated, held to be unenforceable or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or limit the length of term of patent protection we may have for our products. For example, the principal patent protection that covers Silenor consists of method of use patents. This type of patent protects the product only when used or sold for the specified method. However, this type of patent does not limit a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical or similar to Silenor for an indication that is outside of the patented method. Moreover, physicians may prescribe such a competitive or similar product for off-label indications that are covered by the applicable patents. Some physicians are prescribing generic 10mg doxepin capsules and generic oral solution doxepin for insomnia on such an off-label basis in lieu of prescribing Silenor. In addition, some managed healthcare plans are requiring the substitution of these generic doxepin products for Silenor, and some pharmacies are suggesting such substitution. Although such off-label prescriptions may induce or contribute to the infringement of method of use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute.\nOur patent rights also may not afford us protection against competitors with similar technology. In September 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law and includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, including a transition from a first to invent to a first inventor to file system. Because patent applications in the United States and many other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and because publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, neither we nor our licensors can be certain that we or they were the first to invent or file patent applications to the inventions claimed in our or their issued patents or pending patent applications. If a third party has also filed a U.S. patent application covering our product candidates or a similar invention, we may have to participate in an adversarial proceeding at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The specific type of proceeding will be determined by the filing date of the application for patent. If the application for patent was filed prior to March 15, 2013, such a proceeding would be an interference proceeding. For all applications filed after March 15, 2013, such a proceeding would be a derivation proceeding. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial and it is possible that our efforts could be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our U.S. patent position. In addition, patents generally expire, regardless of the date of issue, 20 years from the earliest non-provisional effective U.S. filing date.\nOur collaborators and licensors may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights. These third parties may have the first right to maintain or defend our intellectual property rights and, although we may have the right to assume the maintenance and defense of our intellectual property rights if these third parties do not, our ability to maintain and defend our intellectual property rights may be compromised by the acts or omissions of these third parties.\nTrademark protection of our products may not provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage.\nWe use trademarks on most of our currently marketed branded products and believe that having distinctive marks is an important factor in marketing those products. Trademarks are also an important factor in marketing products of other parties under license or co-promotion agreements. Distinctive marks may also be important for any additional products that we successfully develop and commercially market. However, we generally do not expect our marks to provide a meaningful competitive advantage over other branded or generic products. We believe that efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third party payors are and are likely to continue to be more important factors in the commercial success of our products. For example, physicians and patients may not readily associate our trademark with the applicable product or active pharmaceutical ingredient. In addition, prescriptions written for a branded product are typically filled with the generic version at the pharmacy, resulting in a significant loss in sales of the branded product, including for indications for which the generic version has not been approved for marketing by the FDA. Competitors also may use marks or names that are similar to our trademarks. If we initiate legal proceedings to seek to protect our trademarks, the costs of these proceedings could be substantial and it is possible that our efforts could be unsuccessful.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe have acquired rights to products and product candidates under license and co-promotion agreements with third parties and expect to enter into additional licenses and co-promotion agreements in the future. Our existing licenses impose, and we expect that future licenses will impose, various development and commercialization, purchase commitment, royalty, sublicensing, patent protection and maintenance, insurance and other obligations on us.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under a license agreement, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license in whole, terminate the exclusive nature of the license or bring a claim against us for damages. Any such termination or claim could prevent or impede our ability to market any product that is covered by the licensed patents. Even if we contest any such termination or claim and are ultimately successful, our results of operations and stock price could suffer. In addition, upon any termination of a license agreement, we may be required to license to the licensor any related intellectual property that we developed.\nFor example, we in-licensed rights to Silenor through an exclusive licensing arrangement, and may enter into similar licenses in the future. Under our license agreement for Silenor, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize Silenor. In addition, our licensor has the contractual right to terminate the license agreement upon the breach by us or a specified insolvency event. In the event that our licensor for Silenor terminates the license agreement, even though we would maintain ownership of our clinical data and the other intellectual property we developed relating to Silenor, we would be unable to continue our commercialization activities relating to Silenor and our business and financial condition may be materially harmed.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely upon unpatented proprietary technology, processes, trade secrets and know-how. We seek to protect our unpatented proprietary information in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by consultants, third parties, vendors or former or current employees, despite the existence generally of confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions. Monitoring unauthorized use and disclosure of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate.\nIn addition, the laws of many foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. To the extent that our intellectual property protection is inadequate, we are exposed to a greater risk of direct competition. If our intellectual property is not adequately protected against competitors' products, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We require our consultants and third parties, when appropriate, to execute confidentiality and assignment-of-inventions agreements with us. These agreements typically provide that all materials and confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual's relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances and that all inventions arising out of the individual's relationship with us shall be our exclusive property. These agreements may be breached, and in some instances, we may not have an appropriate remedy available for breach of the agreements. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques, reverse engineer our information and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology. If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, competitors may be able to use this information to develop products that compete with our products, which could adversely impact our business.\nIf we infringe or are alleged to infringe intellectual property rights of third parties, it may adversely affect our business.\nOur development and commercialization activities, as well as any product candidates or products resulting from these activities, may infringe or be claimed to infringe one or more claims of an issued patent or may fall within the scope of one or more claims in a published patent application that may be subsequently issued and to which we do not hold a license or other rights. Third parties may own or control these patents or patent applications in the United States and/or abroad. Such third parties could bring claims against us or our collaborators that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us or our collaborators, we or our collaborators could be forced to stop or delay development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit.\nIf any relevant claims of third-party patents that we are alleged to infringe are upheld as valid and enforceable in any litigation or administrative proceeding, we or our potential future collaborators could be prevented from practicing the subject matter claimed in such patents, or would be required to obtain licenses from the patent owners of each such patent, or to redesign our products, and could be liable for monetary damages. There can be no assurance that such licenses would be available or, if available, would be available on acceptable terms or that we would be successful in any attempt to redesign our products. Even if we or our collaborators were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we or our collaborators are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. This could harm our business significantly. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us or our future collaborators from manufacturing and selling our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. The cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceedings, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position\nWe may need substantial additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts or acquisition strategy.\nWe make significant investments in our currently-marketed products for sales, marketing, and distribution. We have used, and expect to continue to use, revenue from sales of our marketed products to fund acquisitions (at least partially), for development costs and to establish and expand our sales and marketing infrastructure.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nour ability to successfully integrate the operations of newly acquired businesses and assets into our product portfolio;\nthe level of product sales from our currently marketed products and any additional products that we may market in the future;\nthe extent to which we acquire or invest in products, businesses and technologies;\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of clinical development activities for our product candidates;\nthe costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\nthe number of, and development requirements for, additional product candidates that we pursue;\nthe costs of commercialization activities, including product marketing, sales and distribution;\nthe extent to which we choose to establish additional collaboration, co-promotion, distribution or other similar arrangements for our products and product candidates; and\nthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property related claims.\nWe intend to obtain any additional funding we require through public or private equity or debt financings, strategic relationships, including the divestiture of non-core assets, assigning receivables, milestone payments or royalty rights, or other arrangements and we cannot assure such funding will be available on reasonable terms, or at all. Additional equity financing will be dilutive to stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. Any exploration of strategic alternatives may not result in an agreement or transaction and, if completed, any agreement or transaction may not be successful or on attractive terms. The inability to enter into a strategic transaction, or a strategic transaction that is not successful or on attractive terms, could accelerate our need for cash and make securing funding on reasonable terms more difficult. In addition, if we raise additional funds through collaborations or other strategic transactions, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our potential products or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nIf our efforts in raising additional funds when needed are unsuccessful, we may be required to delay, scale-back or eliminate plans or programs relating to our business, relinquish some or all rights to our products or renegotiate less favorable terms with respect to such rights than we would otherwise choose or cease operating as a going concern. In addition, if we do not meet our payment obligations to third parties as they come due, we may be subject to litigation claims. Even if we were successful in defending against these potential claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management, and may result in unfavorable results that could further adversely impact our financial condition.\nIf we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investments.\nIf the estimates that we make, or the assumptions upon which we rely, in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate, our future financial results may vary from expectations.\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, stockholders' equity, revenues and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. For example, at the same time we recognize revenues for product sales, we also record an adjustment, or decrease, to revenue for estimated charge backs, rebates, discounts, vouchers and returns, which management determines on a product-by-product basis as its best estimate at the time of sale based on each product's historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves. For new products, these sales adjustments may be estimated based on information available on any similar products in the marketplace or specific information provided by business partners or if management is not able to derive a reasonable estimate for the adjustments, gross revenue can be deferred and recognized as the product is prescribed.\nActual sales allowances may vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including unanticipated competition, regulatory actions or changes in one or more of our contractual relationships. We cannot assure you, therefore, that there may not be material fluctuations between our estimates and the actual results.\nIf we fail to meet all applicable continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market and it determines to delist our common stock, the market liquidity and market price of our common stock could decline.\nIf we fail to meet all applicable listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market and it determines to delist our common stock, trading, if any, in our shares may continue to be conducted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board or in a non-NASDAQ over-the-counter market, such as the \"pink sheets.\" Delisting of our shares would result in limited release of the market price of those shares and limited analyst coverage and could restrict investors' interest and confidence in our securities. Also, a delisting could have a material adverse effect on the trading market and prices for our shares and our ability to issue additional securities or to secure additional financing. In addition, if our shares were not listed and the trading price of our shares was less than $5.00 per share, our shares could be subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act which, among other things, requires that broker/dealers satisfy special sales practice requirements, including making individualized written suitability determinations and receiving a purchaser's written consent prior to any transaction. In such case, our securities could also be deemed to be a \"penny stock\" under the Securities Enforcement and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990, which would require additional disclosure in connection with trades in those shares, including the delivery of a disclosure schedule explaining the nature and risks of the penny stock market. Such requirements could severely limit the liquidity of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital.\nIf significant business or product announcements by us or our competitors cause fluctuations in our stock price, an investment in our stock may suffer a decline in value.\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to substantial volatility as a result of announcements by us or other companies in our industry, including our collaborators. Announcements that may subject the price of our common stock to substantial volatility include announcements regarding:\nour operating results, including the amount and timing of sales of our products and our ability to successfully integrate the operations of newly acquired businesses or products;\nthe availability and timely delivery of a sufficient supply of our products;\nthe safety and quality of our products or those of our competitors;\nour licensing and collaboration agreements and the products or product candidates that are the subject of those agreements;\nthe results of discoveries, preclinical studies and clinical trials by us or our competitors;\nthe acquisition of technologies, product candidates or products by us or our competitors;\nthe development of new technologies, product candidates or products by us or our competitors;\nregulatory actions with respect to our product candidates or products or those of our competitors; and\nsignificant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe did not make any distributions for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. We are currently investing in our promoted product lines and product candidates and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of our credit agreement with Wells Fargo and the indentures governing our outstanding notes prohibit us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or equity-linked securities could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or equity-linked securities in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nOur operating results are likely to fluctuate from period to period.\nWe anticipate that there may be fluctuations in our future operating results. Potential causes of future fluctuations in our operating results may include:\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in financial results due to seasonal demands for certain of our products;\nunanticipated potential product liability or patent infringement claims;\nnew or increased competition from generics;\nthe introduction of technological innovations or new commercial products by competitors;\nchanges in the availability of reimbursement to the patient from third-party payers for our products;\nthe entry into, or termination of, key agreements, including key strategic alliance agreements;\nthe initiation of litigation to enforce or defend any of our intellectual property rights;\nthe loss of key employees;\nthe results of pre-clinical testing, IND application, and potential clinical trials of some product candidates;\nregulatory changes;\nthe results and timing of regulatory reviews relating to the approval of product candidates;\nthe results of clinical trials conducted by others on products that would compete with our products and product candidates;\nfailure of any of our products or product candidates to achieve commercial success;\ngeneral and industry-specific economic conditions that may affect research and development expenditures;\nfuture sales of our common stock; and\nchanges in the structure of health care payment systems resulting from proposed healthcare legislation or otherwise.\nOur stock price is subject to fluctuation, which may cause an investment in our stock to suffer a decline in value.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to factors that are beyond our control. The stock market in general has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. The market prices of securities of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been extremely volatile and have experienced fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market fluctuations could result in extreme fluctuations in the price of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of our common stock.\nIf we become subject to unsolicited public proposals from activist stockholders due to our shifting strategic focus or otherwise, we may experience significant uncertainty that would likely be disruptive to our business and increase volatility in our stock price.\nPublic companies, particularly those in volatile industries such as the pharmaceutical industry, have been the target of unsolicited public proposals from activist stockholders. The unsolicited and often hostile nature of these public proposals can result in significant uncertainty for current and potential licensors, suppliers, patients, physicians and other constituents, and can cause these parties to change or terminate their business relationships with the targeted company. Companies targeted by these unsolicited proposals from activist stockholders may not be able to attract and retain key personnel as a result of the related uncertainty. In addition, unsolicited proposals can result in stockholder class action lawsuits. The review and consideration of an unsolicited proposal as well as any resulting lawsuits can be a significant distraction for management and employees, and may require the expenditure of significant time, costs and other resources.\nIf we were to receive unsolicited public proposals from activist stockholders, we may encounter all of these risks and, as a result, may be delayed in executing our core strategy. We could be required to spend substantial resources on the evaluation of the proposal as well as the review of other opportunities that never come to fruition. If we were to receive any of these unsolicited public proposals, the future trading price of our common stock is likely to be even more volatile than in the past, and could be subject to wide price fluctuations based on many factors, including uncertainty associated with the proposals.\nWe may become involved in securities or other class action litigation that could divert management's attention and harm our business.\nThe stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the common stock of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Any securities or other class action litigation asserted against us could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe historical and pro forma financial statements we have filed with the SEC relating to Zohydro and Treximet may not be an indication of our ability to commercialize Zohydro and or Treximet.\nIn May 2015 and August 2014, we completed the acquisition of Zohydro and the intellectual property rights to Treximet in the United States from GSK, respectively. We filed historical financial statements and pro forma financial information relating to these products and the SEC stated that it would not object to our conclusion that the filing of the historical financial statements relating to Zohydro and Treximet product line represents substantial compliance with the requirements of Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X, or Rule 3-05. However, we were advised by Zogenix and GSK that the Zohydro and Treximet product lines, respectively, had not been a separate legal entity of Zogenix and GSK and was never operated as a stand-alone business, division or subsidiary. Zogenix and GSK also advised us that they had never prepared full stand-alone or full carve-out financial statements for either business, and that Zogenix and GSK have never maintained the distinct and separate accounts necessary to prepare financial statements that fully comply with the requirements of Rule 3-05. As a result, these historical statements may not be an indication of the performance of either product for the periods indicated. In addition, the assumptions used in preparing the pro forma financial information may not prove to be accurate or relevant to the product lines, in particular on a go-forward basis, and therefore should not be relied upon as a measure of our ability to commercialize these products.\nRisks Related to Product Development\nWe may invest a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of our product candidates and there is no guarantee we will obtain requisite regulatory approvals or otherwise timely bring these product candidates to market.\nOur ability to bring any of our product candidates to market depends on a number of factors including:\nsuccessful completion of pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing;\nan FDA approved investigational new drug application or IND application, becoming effective, which must occur before human clinical trials may commence;\nsuccessful completion of clinical trials;\nsubmission of an NDA;\nreceipt of marketing approvals from the FDA;\nestablishing commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\nlaunching commercial sales of the product;\nacceptance of the product by patients, the medical community and third party payors;\ncompetition from other therapies;\nachieving and maintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to the product; and\na continued acceptable safety profile of the product following approval.\nThere are no guarantees that we will be successful in completing these tasks. If we are not successful in commercializing any of our product candidates, or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be harmed, possibly materially.\nIf our clinical trials do not demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans, we may experience delays, incur additional costs and ultimately be unable to commercialize our product candidates.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of some of our product candidates, we must conduct, at our own expense, extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. In the United States, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in well-controlled studies, and to the satisfaction of the FDA, that each product candidate is safe and effective for use in the target indication. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. The outcome of early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Even if early phase clinical trials are successful, it is necessary to conduct additional clinical trials in larger numbers of patients taking the drug for longer periods before seeking approval from the FDA to market and sell a drug in the United States. Clinical data is often susceptible to varying interpretations, and companies that have believed their products performed satisfactorily in clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain FDA approval for their products. Similarly, even if clinical trials of a product candidate are successful in one indication, clinical trials of that product candidate for other indications may be unsuccessful. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing.\nFailures or delays in the commencement or completion of our clinical trials could result in increased costs to us and delay or limit our ability to generate revenues.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates. Commencement or completion of clinical trials can be delayed or prevented for a number of reasons, including:\nFDA or institutional review boards may not authorize us to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\ndifficulty complying with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or term of a clinical trial;\ndelays in reaching or failure to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations, or CROs, and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\nour clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or the FDA or analogous foreign governmental entities may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or we may abandon projects that we expect to be promising;\nthe number of patients required for our clinical trials may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in our clinical trials may be slower or more difficult than we anticipate, or participants may drop out of our clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\nour third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner;\nwe might have to suspend or terminate our clinical trials if the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\nregulators or institutional review boards may require that we hold, suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\nthe cost of our clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate;\nthe supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical trials may be insufficient or inadequate; and\nthe effects of our product candidates may not be the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects or the product candidates may have other unexpected characteristics.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates in addition to those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trials or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates;\nnot be able to obtain marketing approval; or\nobtain approval for indications that are not as broad as intended.\nOur product development costs also will increase if we experience delays in testing or approvals. Significant clinical trial delays also could shorten the patent protection period during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our products or product candidates. In addition, failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or the trial protocols may also result in the ineligibility to use the data to support market approval.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nSome of our specialty pharmaceutical products are now being marketed without FDA approvals.\nEven though the FDCA requires pre-marketing approval of all new drugs, as a matter of history and regulatory policy, the FDA has historically refrained from taking enforcement action against some marketed, unapproved new drugs. Specifically, some marketed prescription and nonprescription drugs are not the subject of an approved marketing application because they are thought to be identical, related, or similar to historically-marketed products, which were thought not to require pre-market review and approval, or which were approved only on the basis of safety, at the time they entered the marketplace. When enacted in 1938, the FDCA required proof of safety but not efficacy for new drugs. Between 1938 and 1962, if a drug obtained approval, FDA considered drugs that were identical, related, or similar to the approved drug to be covered by that approval, and allowed those drugs to be marketed without independent approval. In 1962, Congress amended the FDCA to require that a new drug be proven effective, as well as safe, to obtain FDA approval. The FDA established the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation, or DESI, program, which was established to determine the effectiveness of drug products approved before 1962. Drugs that were not subject to applications approved between 1938 and 1962 were not subject to DESI review. For a period of time, the FDA permitted these drugs to remain on the market without approval. In 1984, the FDA created a program, known as the Prescription Drug Wrap-Up, also known as DESI II, to address the remaining unapproved drugs. Most of these drugs contain active pharmaceutical ingredients that were first marketed prior to 1938. The FDA asserts that all drugs subject to the Prescription Drug Wrap-Up are on the market illegally and are subject to FDA enforcement discretion because all prescription drugs must be the subject of an approved drug application.\nThere are a few narrow exceptions. Under the 1938 grandfather clause, a drug product that was on the market prior to the passage of the FDCA in 1938 and which contains in its labeling the same representations concerning the conditions of use as it did prior to passage of the FDCA was not considered a \"new drug\" and therefore was exempt from the requirement of having an approved NDA. The 1962 grandfather clause exempts a drug from the effectiveness requirements if its composition and labeling has not changed since 1962 and if, on the day before the 1962 Amendments became effective, it was (a) used or sold commercially in the United States, (b) not a new drug as defined by the FDCA at that time, and (c) not covered by an effective application. The FDA and the courts have interpreted these two grandfather clauses very narrowly. The FDA believes that there are very few drugs on the market that are actually entitled to grandfather status because the drugs currently on the market likely differ from the previous versions in some respect, such as formulation, dosage or strength, dosage form, route of administration, indications, or intended patient population. It is a company's burden to prove that its product is grandfathered.\nThe FDA has adopted a risk-based enforcement policy concerning these unapproved drugs. While all such drugs are considered to require FDA approval, FDA enforcement against such products as unapproved new drugs prioritizes products that pose potential safety risks, lack evidence of effectiveness, prevent patients from seeking effective therapies or are marketed fraudulently. In addition, the FDA has indicated that approval of an NDA for one drug within a class of drugs marketed without FDA approval may also trigger agency enforcement of the new drug requirements against all other drugs within that class that have not been so approved.\nSome of our specialty pharmaceutical products are marketed in the United States without an FDA-approved marketing application because they have been considered by us to be identical, related or similar to products that have existed in the market without an NDA or ANDA. These products are marketed subject to the FDA's regulatory discretion and enforcement policies, and it is possible that the FDA could disagree with our determination that one or more of these products is identical, related or similar to products that have existed in the marketplace without an NDA or ANDA. On March 3, 2011, the FDA announced its\nintent to remove certain unapproved prescription cough, cold, and allergy products from the U.S. market and named products from two cough and cold product families that Pernix sold, as well as certain Cypress products. The FDA provided three dates for the cessation of manufacturing, shipping or other introduction or delivery into commerce - March 3, 2011 for drugs not listed with the FDA under Section 510 of the FDCA, June 1, 2011 for cessation of manufacturing of listed drugs and August 31, 2011 for cessation of shipping of listed drugs covered by the notice. Manufacturing or shipping of the drug products covered by the notice beyond the date specified can result in enforcement action, including seizure, injunction, or other judicial or administrative proceedings. The time periods will not be extended for those who have submitted but not yet received approval of an NDA or ANDA application for a drug product covered by the notice. The Company completed the conversion of the ALDEX and BROVEX product families, two of our legacy cough and cold product families, to OTC monograph from DESI drugs in 2011. The Company believes it has appropriately marketed these lines as OTC monograph products. If the FDA were to disagree with our determination, it could require the removal of our unapproved products from the market. We voluntarily discontinued these products in 2013.\nThe Company's authorized generic products that are OTC monograph products have not been affected by the FDA announcement. Certain Macoven generic products that were not marketed as OTC monograph were converted, and we did not experience any suspension, delay or interruption in our sales of these products. Our remaining generic DESI cough and cold products that were not being converted to OTC monograph were phased out by 2011 and did not have a material impact on the results of operations or financial condition of the Company. If the FDA were to disagree with our determination, it could ask or require the removal of our unapproved products from the market; however, this would no longer have a material impact on our gross sales.\nIn addition, if the FDA issues an approved NDA for one of the drug products within the class of drugs that includes one or more of our unapproved products or completes the efficacy review for that drug product, it may require us to also file an NDA or ANDA application for its unapproved products in that class of drugs in order to continue marketing them in the United States. While the FDA generally provides sponsors with a one-year grace period during which time they are permitted to continue selling the unapproved drug, it is not statutorily required to do so and could ask or require that the unapproved products be removed from the market immediately. In addition, the time it takes us to complete the necessary clinical trials and submit an NDA or ANDA to the FDA may exceed any applicable grace period, which would result in an interruption of sales of such unapproved products. If the FDA asks or requires that the unapproved products be removed from the market, our financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nIf the FDA disagrees with our determination that several of our products meet the over-the-counter requirements, those products may be removed from the market.\nDrugs must meet all of the general conditions for OTC drugs and all of the conditions contained in an applicable final monograph to be considered generally recognized as safe and effective (GRAS/GRAE) and to be marketed without FDA approval of a marketing application. The general conditions include, among other things, compliance with cGMP, establishment registration and labeling requirements. Any product which fails to comply with the general conditions and a monograph is liable to regulatory action. We believe our promoted branded products comply with FDA OTC monograph requirements. However, if the FDA determines that our products do not comply with the monograph or if we fail to meet the general conditions, the products may be removed from the market and we may face actions including, but not limited to, restrictions on the marketing or distribution of such products, warning letters, fines, product seizure, or injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. Any of these actions would reduce our gross sales.\nIf we are not able to obtain required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates and our ability to generate increased revenue will be materially impaired.\nOur product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA, the DEA and other regulatory agencies in the United States. Failure to obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. Securing FDA approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the FDA for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate's safety and efficacy. Securing FDA approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the FDA. Our future products may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory approvals is expensive, often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved and the nature of the disease or condition to be treated. Changes in regulatory approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a product candidate. Any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if regulatory approval of a product is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers, or manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in actions such as:\nwithdrawal of the products from the market;\nrestrictions on the marketing or distribution of such products;\nrestrictions on the manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\nwarning letters;\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\nrecalls;\nfines;\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products;\nproduct seizure; or\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nIn addition, the FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, or for the indications specified in an applicable OTC monograph and in accordance with the monograph's labeling requirements. An organization that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability by the FDA and other agencies that actively enforce laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. The Federal Trade Commission regulates advertising for OTC drug products and advertising for these products must be truthful, not misleading and adequately substantiated. If we are found to have promoted off-label uses, our OTC products may be deemed out of compliance with the applicable OTC monograph, we may be enjoined from such off-label promotion and become subject to significant liability, which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, business and revenues, if any.\nOur sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payors, and a reduction in the payment rate or reimbursement could result in decreased use or sales of our products.\nOur sales of currently marketed products are, and any future sales of our product candidates will be, dependent, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private insurance plans. All of our promoted products are generally well covered by managed care and private insurance plans. Generally, the status or tier within managed care formularies, which are lists of approved products developed by MCOs, varies but coverage is similar to other products within the same class of drugs. For example, Cedax is covered by private insurance plans similar to other marketed, branded cephalosporins. However, the position of any of our branded products that requires a higher patient copayment may make it more difficult to expand the current market share for such product. In some cases, MCOs may require additional evidence that a patient had previously failed another therapy, additional paperwork or prior authorization from the MCO before approving reimbursement for a branded product. Some Medicare Part D plans also cover some or all of our products, but the amount and level of coverage varies from plan to plan. We also participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and submit all of our products for inclusion in this program. Coverage of our products under individual state Medicaid plans varies from state to state. Additionally, some of our products are purchased under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which is codified as Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act. Section 340B limits the cost of covered outpatient drugs to certain federal grantees, federally qualified health center lookalikes and qualified disproportionate share hospitals.\nThere have been, there are and we expect there will continue to be federal and state legislative and administrative proposals that could limit the amount that government health care programs will pay to reimburse the cost of pharmaceutical and biologic products. For example, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, created a new Medicare benefit for prescription drugs. More recently, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 significantly reduced reimbursement for drugs under the Medicaid program. Legislative or administrative acts that reduce reimbursement for our products could adversely impact our business.\nIn March 2010, the President signed the PPACA, which makes extensive changes to the delivery of healthcare in the U.S. This act includes numerous provisions that affect pharmaceutical companies, some of which were effective immediately and others of which will be taking effect over the next several years. For example, the act seeks to expand healthcare coverage to the uninsured through private health insurance reforms and an expansion of Medicaid. The act also imposes substantial costs on pharmaceutical manufacturers, such as an increase in liability for rebates paid to Medicaid, new drug discounts that must be offered to certain enrollees in the Medicare prescription drug benefit, an annual fee imposed on all manufacturers of brand prescription drugs in the U.S., increased disclosure obligations and an expansion of an existing program requiring pharmaceutical discounts to certain types of hospitals and federally subsidized clinics. The act also contains cost-containment measures that could reduce reimbursement levels for healthcare items and services generally, including pharmaceuticals. It also will require reporting and public disclosure of payments and other transfers of value provided by pharmaceutical companies to physicians and teaching hospitals. These measures could result in decreased net revenues from our pharmaceutical products and decreased potential returns from our development efforts. Although the PPACA was recently upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, it is possible that the PPACA may be modified or repealed in the future.\nIn addition, private insurers, such as MCOs, may adopt their own reimbursement reductions in response to federal or state legislation. Any reduction in reimbursement for our products could materially harm our results of operations. In addition, we believe that the increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of our products, which may adversely impact our product sales. Furthermore, when a new product is approved, governmental and private coverage for that product and the amount for which that product will be reimbursed are uncertain. We cannot predict the availability or amount of reimbursement for our product candidates, and current reimbursement policies for marketed products may change at any time.\nThe MMA established a voluntary prescription drug benefit, called Part D, which became effective in 2006 for all Medicare beneficiaries. We cannot be certain that our currently marketed products will continue to be, or any of our product candidates still in development will be, included in the Medicare prescription drug benefit. Even if our products are included, the private health plans that administer the Medicare drug benefit can limit the number of prescription drugs that are covered on their formularies in each therapeutic category and class. In addition, private managed care plans and other government agencies continue to seek price discounts. Because many of these same private health plans administer the Medicare drug benefit, they have the ability to influence prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population. In addition, certain states have proposed or adopted various programs under their Medicaid programs to control drug prices, including price constraints, restrictions on access to certain products and bulk purchasing of drugs.\nIf we succeed in bringing additional products to the market, these products may not be considered cost-effective and reimbursement to the patient may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our product candidates on a competitive basis to a sufficient patient population. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic trials in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products and product candidates.\nOur relationships with customers and payors are subject to applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputation harm, and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and others play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of our products. Our arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulation that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products. Applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include but are not limited to, the following:\nthe federal healthcare anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\nthe Ethics in Patient Referrals Act, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, and its corresponding regulations, prohibit physicians from referring patients for designated health services reimbursed under the Medicare and Medicaid programs to entities with which the physicians or their immediate family members have a financial relationship or an ownership interest, subject to narrow regulatory exceptions;\nthe federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\nthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in countries outside of the U.S., such as the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make, improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment;\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\nthe federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; and\nanalogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers, and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government.\nIn addition, there have been a number of other legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the pharmaceutical industry. These include proposals to permit reimportation of pharmaceutical products from other countries and proposals concerning safety matters. For example, in an attempt to protect against counterfeiting and diversion of drugs, a bill was introduced in a previous Congress that would establish an electronic drug pedigree and track-and-trace system capable of electronically recording and authenticating every sale of a drug unit throughout the distribution chain. This bill or a similar bill may be introduced in Congress in the future. California has already effected legislation that requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the saleable unit level through the distribution system. Compliance with California and any future federal or state electronic pedigree requirements will likely require an increase in our operational expenses and will likely be administratively burdensome. As a result of these and other new proposals, we may determine to change our current manner of operation, provide additional benefits or change our contract arrangements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe, as well as many other pharmaceutical companies, sponsor prescription drug coupons and other cost-savings programs to help reduce the burden of co-payments and co-insurance. During 2012, lawsuits have been filed against several pharmaceutical companies alleging, among other things, that the drug-makers violated antitrust laws and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, when they provided coupon programs to privately-insured consumers that subsidize all or part of the cost-sharing obligation (co-pay or co-insurance) for a branded prescription drug or drugs. We cannot be certain as to whether we will be named in any future similar lawsuit or concerning the potential outcome of the ongoing litigation.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations could be costly. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our past or present operations, including activities conducted by our sales team or agents, are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from third-party payor programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nMany aspects of these laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of subjective interpretations, which increases the risk of potential violations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management's attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation.\nThe Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and to produce, market and distribute our existing products.\nThe Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, or the FDAAA, grants a variety of new powers to the FDA, many of which are aimed at improving drug safety and assuring the safety of drug products after approval. The amendments, among other things, require some new drug applicants to submit risk evaluation and minimization strategies to monitor and address potential safety issues for products upon approval, grant the FDA the authority to impose risk management measures for marketed products and to mandate labeling changes in certain circumstances, and establish new requirements for disclosing the results of clinical trials. Companies that violate the law are subject to substantial civil monetary penalties. Additional measures have also been enacted to address the perceived shortcomings in the FDA's handling of drug safety issues, and to limit pharmaceutical company sales and promotional practices. While the FDAAA has had, and is expected to have, a substantial effect on the pharmaceutical industry, the full extent of that effect is not yet known. As the FDA issues further regulations, guidance and interpretations relating to this legislation, the impact on the industry as well as our business will become clearer. The requirements and other changes that the FDAAA imposes may make it more difficult, and likely more costly, to obtain approval of new pharmaceutical products and to produce, market and distribute existing products. Our and our partners' ability to commercialize approved products successfully may be hindered, and our business may be harmed as a result.\nWe may be subject to investigations or other inquiries concerning our compliance with reporting obligations under federal healthcare program pharmaceutical pricing requirements.\nUnder federal healthcare programs, some state governments and private payors investigate and have filed civil actions against numerous pharmaceutical companies alleging that the reporting of prices for pharmaceutical products has resulted in false and overstated average wholesale price, which in turn may be alleged to have improperly inflated the reimbursements paid by Medicare, private insurers, state Medicaid programs, medical plans and others to healthcare providers who prescribed and administered those products or pharmacies that dispensed those products. These same payors may allege that companies do not properly report their \"best prices\" to the state under the Medicaid program. Suppliers of outpatient pharmaceuticals to the Medicaid program are also subject to price rebate agreements. Failure to comply with these price rebate agreements may lead to federal or state investigations, criminal or civil liability, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, and otherwise harm our reputation, business and prospects.", "PERMNO": 84581, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "PTXTQ"}
