You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before deciding whether to make an investment decision with respect to our common stock. You should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our financial statements and related notes. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties. In any such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. We caution you that the risks, uncertainties and other factors referred to below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may not contain all of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may affect our future results and operations. Moreover, new risks will emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Needs\nWe have incurred net losses every year since our inception and have no source of product revenue. We expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses and may never become profitable.\nWe have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and we expect to continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred losses in each year since commencing operations. Our net losses were $102.5 million, $42.8 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $298.6 million.\nWe have spent, and expect to continue to spend, significant resources to fund research and development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates. We expect to incur substantial and increasing operating losses over the next several years as our research, development, manufacturing, preclinical studies, clinical trial and related activities increase. We also expect that our funding obligations with respect to the development of our current and potential future product candidates will substantially increase following the end of the current two-year extension of the research phase of our collaboration with Merck through March 16, 2022, regardless of whether we are able to reach agreement with Merck on the terms of a modified collaboration. As a result, our expenses and accumulated deficit will also increase significantly in future periods. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business, including those resulting from the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses, whether Merck will exercise its option to extend the research phase of our collaboration or whether and on what terms we will reach agreement with Merck on a modified collaboration and our ability to otherwise continue to generate revenue, if at all, under the Merck collaboration, and to generate any revenue outside of the Merck collaboration. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nIn addition, we will not be able to generate product revenue unless and until one of our product candidates successfully completes clinical trials, receives regulatory approval and is successfully commercialized. As our product candidates are in Phase 2 trials or in earlier stages of development, we do not expect to receive product revenue from our product candidates for a number of years, if ever. Our ability to generate future product revenue from our current or future product candidates also depends on a number of additional factors, including our or our current collaborator\u2019s and potential future collaborators\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully complete research and clinical development of current and future product candidates;\n\u2022\nestablish and maintain supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties, and ensure adequate, scaled up and legally compliant manufacturing of bulk drug substances and drug products to maintain sufficient supply;\n\u2022\nlaunch and commercialize any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, if any, and, if launched independently by us without a collaborator, successfully establish a sales force and marketing and distribution infrastructure;\n\u2022\ndemonstrate the necessary safety data (and, if accelerated approval is obtained, verify the clinical benefit) post-approval to ensure continued regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nobtain coverage and adequate product reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors, for any approved products;\n\u2022\nachieve market acceptance for any approved products;\n\u2022\nestablish, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\nattract, hire and retain qualified personnel.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, including that our product candidates may not advance through development or be approved for commercial sale, we are unable to predict if or when we will generate product revenue or achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we successfully complete development and regulatory processes, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with launching and commercializing any products. If we fail to become profitable or do not sustain profitability on a continuing basis, we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or cease our operations.\nAll of our revenue for recent periods has been received from a single collaboration partner.\nIn recent years, all of our revenue has been from our collaboration partner, Merck. Other than our agreement with Merck, we currently have no agreements that could provide us with material, ongoing future revenue and we may never enter into any agreements. Under our Collaboration Agreement, Merck agreed to reimburse us for research and development activities up to certain specified funding caps during the current two-year extension of the research phase through March 16, 2022. If our research and development expenses for product candidates subject to the Merck collaboration exceed the funding caps provided in our Collaboration Agreement, which happened in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and could happen in the future, we will be required to devote our own financial resources toward the development of such product candidates or, if we are unwilling or unable to do so, pause or suspend such development to remain within the funding caps. In addition, while we cannot predict whether or when Merck will elect to extend the research phase of the collaboration through March 16, 2024 or on what terms, or whether or when we will reach agreement with Merck on the terms of a modified collaboration generally, we expect that any modified collaboration would result in a level of annual research support from Merck during any extension of the current research phase after March 16, 2022 that is meaningfully lower than the annual research support Merck provided during the initial five-year term and is providing during the current two-year extension of the research phase. In this regard, we expect that under the terms of a modified collaboration, Merck will not provide research funding for certain of our product candidates. We also expect that if we are unable to reach agreement with Merck on modified terms, Merck will not elect to extend the research phase of the collaboration and will decide not to proceed with certain of our product candidates after the end of the current research phase. In any event, we expect that our funding obligations with respect to the development of our current and potential future product candidates will substantially increase following March 16, 2022, the end of the current two-year extension of the research phase, regardless of whether we are able to reach agreement with Merck on modified terms. Accordingly, we will require significant additional capital in order to proceed with development and commercialization of our current and potential future product candidates, including any product candidate that had been subject to the Merck collaboration but Merck decides not to proceed with under the terms of a modified collaboration or after the end of the research phase, or we will need to enter into additional collaboration or license agreements in order to fund such development and commercialization. Neither may be possible and as a result, we may be required to delay, scale back or discontinue development of such product candidates. For more information, see \u201cRisks Related to Our Dependence on Merck and Other Third Parties\u201d below.\nWe will require substantial additional capital to finance our operations, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. As a result, we may not have the resources to complete the development and commercialization of our current and potential future product candidates.\nAs a research and development company, our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception and we will require substantial additional capital to finance our operations and pursue our strategy. In this regard, we do not have any committed external source of funds, other than pursuant to the current terms of\nour collaboration with Merck, which is limited in scope and duration, and may be unilaterally terminated by Merck under certain circumstances. In addition, as described in more detail under \u201cRisks Related to Our Dependence on Merck and Other Third Parties\u201d below, the level of future annual research support or other funding from Merck following the end of the current research phase is uncertain, and even if Merck elects to extend the current research phase, such annual research support from Merck is expected to be meaningfully lower than the annual research support Merck provided during the initial five-year term and is providing during the current two-year extension of the research phase through March 16, 2022. We also expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities regardless of whether we are able to reach agreement with Merck on the terms of a modified collaboration, particularly to the extent that product candidates whose costs will not be included in a modified Merck collaboration, such as aldafermin and other product candidates Merck decides not to proceed with under the terms of a modified collaboration or after the end of the research phase, advance in clinical development. In addition, we may be required to develop and implement additional clinical study policies and procedures to mitigate the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could significantly increase our research and development expenses.\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. In addition, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Our future funding requirements, both short- and long-term, will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe initiation, progress, timing, delays, costs and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our current and future product candidates;\n\u2022\nwhether and on what terms Merck exercises, if at all, its remaining option to extend the research phase of the collaboration, including whether such exercise would trigger an extension payment to us under the terms of a modified collaboration;\n\u2022\nwhether and on what terms we and Merck agree to a modified collaboration, including the level of annual research support from Merck, if any, under a modified collaboration and, relatedly, the scope and extent of our funding obligations with respect to the development of our current and potential future product candidates, including with respect to any such product candidates whose costs will not be included in a modified Merck collaboration such as aldafermin and other product candidates Merck decides not to proceed with under the terms of a modified collaboration or after the end of the research phase;\n\u2022\nwhether Merck exercises its option to license product candidates upon completion of proof-of-concept studies for each such candidate in humans;\n\u2022\nwhether Merck terminates the research phase of the collaboration under pre-specified circumstances set forth in the Collaboration Agreement or terminates a program that it has licensed (such as Merck\u2019s termination of its license for NGM395 and NGM386);\n\u2022\nwhether we exceed the funding caps provided in the Collaboration Agreement;\n\u2022\nthe outcome, timing and cost of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for such authorities to require that we perform more studies than those that we currently expect or to change their requirements on studies that had previously been agreed to;\n\u2022\nthe cost to establish, maintain, expand, enforce and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with licensing, preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patents or other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe effect of products that may compete with our product candidates or other market developments;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of any approved product candidates, including product pricing and product reimbursement by third-party payors;\n\u2022\nthe cost of acquiring, licensing or investing in additional businesses, products, product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of selecting, auditing and potentially validating a manufacturing site for commercial-scale manufacturing;\n\u2022\nthe cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval and that we determine to commercialize ourselves or in collaboration with partners; and\n\u2022\nthe extent to which any of the foregoing costs are the responsibility of Merck.\nWe plan to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity or debt offerings, including under the Open Market Sale AgreementSM, or the Sales Agreement, we entered into with Jefferies LLC in June 2020, government or other third-party funding, product collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or a combination of these. Additional capital may not be available in sufficient amounts, on reasonable terms or when we need it, if at all, and our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by worsening global economic conditions and the disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from, among other things, the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. If we are unable to raise adequate additional capital, we may be prevented from pursuing development and commercialization efforts, which will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, lead to restrictions on our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our product candidates or intellectual property.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, as we did most recently in January 2021, our stockholders may experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. Furthermore, any securities that we may issue may have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants or protective rights that would lead to restrictions on our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If adequate funds are not available when we need them, we may need to:\n\u2022\nsignificantly delay, scale back or discontinue research and discovery efforts and the development or commercialization of any product candidates, or cease all operations;\n\u2022\nseek strategic alliances for research and development programs when we otherwise would not, at an earlier stage than we would otherwise desire or on terms less favorable than might otherwise be available; or\n\u2022\nenter into product collaborations that would generally require us to relinquish, or license on potentially unfavorable terms, our rights to intellectual property, product candidates or products that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves, and we may not be able to enter into such agreements on acceptable terms, if at all.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income could be limited.\nWe plan to use our current year operating losses to offset taxable income from any revenue generated from operations, including corporate collaborations. To the extent that our taxable income exceeds any current year operating losses, we plan to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset income that would otherwise be taxable. Our net operating loss carryforwards generated in tax years ending on or prior to December 31, 2017 are only permitted to be carried forward for 20 years under applicable U.S. tax law. Under the Tax Cuts and JOBS Act, or the 2017 Tax Act, as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, our federal net operating losses generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses generated in tax years beginning\nafter December 31, 2020, is limited to 80% of taxable income. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the 2017 Tax Act or the CARES Act.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and corresponding provisions of state law, if we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in equity ownership over a three-year period, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset our post-change income may be limited. Due to our initial public offering and other shifts in our stock ownership, we have experienced ownership changes in the past and may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which are outside our control. As a result, our use of federal net operating loss carryforwards could be limited. State net operating loss carryforwards may be similarly limited. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of net operating losses is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. For example, California recently imposed limits on the usability of California net operating loss carryforwards and certain tax credits to offset California taxable income or California tax liabilities in tax years beginning after 2019 and before 2023. Any such limitations may result in greater tax liabilities than we would incur in the absence of such limitations and any increased liabilities could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Merck and Other Third Parties\nWe depend on our collaboration with Merck and may depend in the future on collaborations with additional third parties for the development and commercialization of our product candidates. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of our product candidates.\nThe Merck collaboration involves a complex allocation of rights, provides for substantial research and development support, currently provides for additional payments upon Merck\u2019s election, if exercised in its unilateral discretion, to further extend the term of the research phase for an additional two years and provides us with either milestone payments based on the achievement of specified clinical development, regulatory and commercial milestones and royalty-based revenue if certain product candidates are successfully commercialized or a cost and profit sharing arrangement with the possibility that we would provide sales representatives to co-detail the product candidates that Merck elects to advance in the United States. We cannot predict the success of the collaboration, whether or when Merck will elect to extend the research phase of the collaboration or on what terms, whether or when we will reach agreement with Merck on the terms of a modified collaboration generally, whether Merck will exercise its option to license additional product candidates or whether Merck will terminate its license to a licensed program. In addition, see the risk factor titled \u201cMerck may elect not to extend the research phase of our collaboration and we may otherwise be unable to reach agreement with Merck on the terms of a modified collaboration and regardless of whether we and Merck reach agreement on the terms of a modified collaboration, our collaboration with Merck involves numerous risks, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition\u201d below.\nWe may seek other third-party collaborators for the development and commercialization of any product candidates that are not subject to the Merck collaboration, including aldafermin, NGM395 and NGM386 or any other product candidate that Merck decides not to proceed with under the terms of a modified collaboration or after the end of the research phase. If we enter into any such arrangements with any third parties, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenue from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nCollaborations involving our product candidates, including our collaboration with Merck, pose risks to us, including the following:\n\u2022\nCollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations. For example, under the current terms of our collaboration with Merck, once proof-of-concept data in humans has been generated and Merck has exercised its option to acquire an exclusive license for a product candidate, our ability to influence the\nresources Merck devotes to such product candidate are substantially reduced until such time, if any, that we exercise our right to participate in a cost and profit-sharing arrangement. Even after we exercise that right to participate in a cost and profit-sharing arrangement, our ability to influence Merck will be limited.\n\u2022\nCollaborators might opt not to pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborator\u2019s strategic focus or available funding or external factors, such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities. For example, we and Merck are negotiating in good faith certain modifications to the terms of our collaboration, that may include, among other things, focusing NGM\u2019s research and development under the collaboration on therapeutic areas of particular interest to Merck, and we expect that any modified collaboration would result in a level of annual research support from Merck during any extension of the current research phase after March 16, 2022 that is meaningfully lower than the annual research support Merck provided during the initial five-year term and is providing during the current two-year extension of the research phase, In addition, under the current terms of the Collaboration Agreement, it is possible for Merck to unilaterally terminate the MK-3655 program and any other program (whether or not we have exercised our cost and profit sharing option) upon prior written notice, such as it did for NGM386 and NGM395, without triggering a termination of the remainder of the Collaboration Agreement. Moreover, regardless of our current negotiations with Merck and the terms of any modified Collaboration Agreement, Merck may elect not to exercise its option to extend the research phase, and Merck might also opt not to designate any of our product candidates for further development during the tail period following the end of the research phase or exercise any of its options to acquire a license to a product candidate that has generated proof-of-concept data.\n\u2022\nCollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing.\n\u2022\nCollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our medicines or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours.\n\u2022\nA collaborator with marketing and distribution rights might not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of our product candidates.\n\u2022\nCollaborators might not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation.\n\u2022\nDisputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our medicines or product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources.\n\u2022\nWe may lose certain valuable rights under circumstances identified in our collaborations, including, in the case of our collaboration with Merck, if we undergo a change in control.\n\u2022\nCollaborations might be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\n\u2022\nCollaboration agreements might not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner, or at all. If a present or future collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program under such collaboration could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nMerck may elect not to extend the research phase of our collaboration and we may otherwise be unable to reach agreement with Merck on the terms of a modified collaboration and regardless of whether we and\nMerck reach agreement on the terms of a modified collaboration, our collaboration with Merck involves numerous risks, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nUnder the terms of the collaboration, Merck was required to notify us no later than March 17, 2021 of its unilateral decision whether to exercise its option to extend the research phase of the collaboration for an additional two-year term through March 16, 2024. In March 2021, Merck initiated discussions with us with respect to elements of the ongoing collaboration that might be optimized to better address the evolving interests and priorities of both NGM and Merck during the remainder of the current research phase through March 16, 2022 and during any extension of the current research phase and any tail period (which tail period is discussed under \u201cBusiness-Our Collaboration with Merck\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). In this regard, the parties are negotiating in good faith certain modifications to the terms of the collaboration. Such modifications may include, among other things, focusing NGM\u2019s research and development under the collaboration on therapeutic areas of particular interest to Merck, while enabling NGM to conduct research and development outside of these therapeutic areas, which would, if mutually agreed to, allow NGM to discover and develop product candidates on its own or with third parties in other areas of interest. In order to allow negotiations to proceed, the parties have agreed to extend the March 17, 2021 deadline for Merck to deliver its extension notification decision until June 30, 2021. While we cannot predict whether or when Merck will elect to extend the research phase of the collaboration or on what terms, or whether or when we will reach agreement with Merck on the terms of a modified collaboration generally, we expect that any modified collaboration would result in a level of annual research support from Merck during any extension of the current research phase after March 16, 2022 that is meaningfully lower than the annual research support Merck provided during the initial five-year term and is providing during the current two-year extension of the research phase. In this regard, we expect that under the terms of a modified collaboration, Merck will not provide research funding for certain of our product candidates. We also expect that if we are unable to reach agreement with Merck on modified terms, Merck will not elect to extend the research phase of the collaboration and will decide not to proceed with certain of our product candidates after the end of the current research phase. In any event, we expect that our funding obligations with respect to the development of our current and potential future product candidates will substantially increase following March 16, 2022, the end of the current two-year extension of the research phase, regardless of whether we are able to reach agreement with Merck on modified terms and we cannot otherwise assure you that Merck will elect to extend the research phase or that we will reach agreement with Merck on modified terms.\nIn addition, the level of future research funding from Merck following the end of the current research phase is uncertain. For example, if Merck does not elect to extend the research phase, we expect that Merck would decide not to designate certain of our product candidates for development during the tail period and it is possible that Merck could decide not to designate any of our product candidates for development during the tail period, in which case research funding from Merck would be substantially reduced or eliminated following the end of the current research phase. In addition, Merck is not required to designate any of our product candidates for development during the tail period until the three-month period prior to the end of the research phase, which could delay or preclude our ability to move forward with the development of certain of our product candidates, and could otherwise result in uncertainty regarding the future prospects of certain of our product candidates. Moreover, our stock price could decline as a result of such uncertainty and/or Merck\u2019s failure to designate certain of our product candidates for development during the tail period. Even if Merck elects to designate certain product candidates for development during the tail period, there are limits on Merck\u2019s funding obligations and Merck has the ability to terminate the tail period early. In addition, in the event that Merck decides to take over any designated product candidates for development during the tail period, we could be subject to disputes with Merck with respect to their obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts with respect to such development, which could delay or preclude the further development of the affected product candidate, and we could otherwise be subject to disputes with Merck over the scope of the parties\u2019 respective rights under the Collaboration Agreement.\nIn addition, under the Collaboration Agreement, Merck has the unilateral right to terminate all or part of the agreement at certain times and under certain circumstances. Merck also may unilaterally terminate its annual funding of the research program prior to the end of the research phase if we are acquired by a third party or if we are in material uncured breach of our obligations under the research and early development program. After the current research phase of the collaboration or, if Merck again exercises its option to extend the research phase under modified collaboration terms, after such extension period, Merck may unilaterally terminate the overall agreement for convenience upon written notice and subject to certain limitations.\nSubject to certain limitations, Merck may partially terminate the Collaboration Agreement for convenience as it relates to MK-3655 or any future licensed program. For example, Merck terminated its license to our GDF15 receptor agonist program, including NGM395 and NGM386, in May 2019. Merck may also unilaterally terminate the agreement as it relates to its rights to research and develop small molecule compounds. It may also unilaterally terminate the agreement with respect to a specific licensed program in the event of an uncured material breach by us. If Merck terminates a program as a result of our uncured material breach, then we would lose our option to participate in global cost and profit sharing if not yet exercised as of the time of termination and lose our co-detailing option (whether or not exercised as of that time) for the relevant licensed program.\nIf Merck terminates funding or terminates the Collaboration Agreement, if we are unable to reach agreement with Merck on the terms of a modified collaboration and Merck decides not to extend the research phase of the collaboration or shifts the focus of its research and development funding or if Merck declines to designate our product candidates for development during the tail period, it would delay or preclude our ability to complete our research and development programs, which would materially and adversely affect our business and our stock price would likely decline.\nWe may not be able to obtain and maintain the relationships with third parties that are necessary to develop, commercialize and manufacture some or all of our product candidates.\nIn addition to our dependence on our collaboration with Merck, we expect to depend on other collaborators, partners, licensees, CROs, clinical data management organizations, clinical investigators, CMOs and other third parties to support our discovery efforts, to formulate product candidates, to conduct our clinical trials and certain aspects of our research and preclinical studies, to manufacture clinical and commercial scale quantities of our drug substances and drug products and to market, sell and distribute any products we successfully develop and for which we obtain regulatory approval. Any problems we experience with any of these third parties could delay our research efforts or the development, commercialization and manufacturing of our products or product candidates, which could harm our results of operations.\nWe cannot guarantee that we or, as applicable, our collaborator will be able to successfully negotiate agreements for, or maintain relationships with, collaborators, partners, licensees, CROs, clinical data management organizations, clinical investigators, CMOs and other third parties on favorable terms, if at all. If we or our collaborator are unable to obtain or maintain these agreements, we may not be able to clinically develop, formulate, manufacture, obtain regulatory approvals for or commercialize our product candidates, which will, in turn, adversely affect our business. If we or our collaborator need to enter into alternative arrangements, it would delay our product development activities and such alternative arrangements may not be available on terms acceptable to us.\nWe expect to continue to expend substantial management time and effort to enter into relationships with third parties and, if we successfully enter into such relationships, to manage these relationships. In addition, our reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. However, we cannot control the amount or timing of resources our contract partners will devote to our research and development programs, product candidates or potential product candidates, and we cannot guarantee that these parties will fulfill their obligations to us under these arrangements in a timely fashion, if at all. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our medicines. In addition, we base our expense accruals related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf and, if their estimates are not accurate, it could negatively affect the accuracy of our financial statements.\nAny agreements we have or may enter into with these third parties may give rise to disputes regarding the rights and obligations of the parties. Disagreements could develop over contract interpretation, rights to ownership or use of intellectual property, the scope and direction of research and development, the approach for regulatory approvals or commercialization strategy. We are conducting research programs in a range of therapeutic areas, and our pursuit of these opportunities could result in conflicts with the other parties to these agreements that may be developing or selling pharmaceuticals or conducting other activities in these same\ntherapeutic areas. Any disputes or commercial conflicts could lead to the termination of our agreements, delay progress of our product development programs, compromise our ability to renew agreements or obtain future agreements, lead to the loss of intellectual property rights, result in increased financial obligations for us or result in costly litigation.\nIn addition, we are less knowledgeable about the reputation and quality of third-party contractors in countries outside of the United States where we conduct discovery research or preclinical and clinical development and manufacturing of our product candidates and, therefore, we may not choose the best parties for these relationships.\nWe may seek to establish additional collaborations, and, if we are not able to establish them on commercially reasonable terms, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nOur drug development programs and the potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. For product candidates not partnered with Merck, such as aldafermin, NGM395 and NGM386 or any other product candidate that Merck decides not to proceed with under the terms of a modified collaboration or after the end of the research phase, we may decide to collaborate with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for their development and potential commercialization. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors, including the potential market for the subject product candidate.\nWe also may be restricted under existing collaboration agreements from entering into future agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators. For example, under the current terms of our Collaboration Agreement with Merck, we may not directly or indirectly research, develop, manufacture or commercialize, except pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, any medicine or product candidate that modulates a target then subject to the collaboration with specified activity. The FGF19 program, including aldafermin, is excluded from this provision, notwithstanding that both aldafermin and MK-3655 signal, in part, through the FGFR1c pathway. During the tail period following the research term of the collaboration, we may not directly or indirectly research, develop or commercialize, outside of the collaboration, any medicine or product candidate with specified activity against any collaboration target that has been designated a tail target.\nWe may not be able to negotiate potential future collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to delay, scale back or discontinue the development of any product candidate for which we are seeking a collaboration, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur product candidates must undergo rigorous clinical trials before seeking regulatory approvals, which could delay or prevent commercialization of our product candidates.\nAll of our product candidates will be subject to rigorous and extensive clinical trials before we can seek regulatory approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Clinical trials may be delayed, suspended or terminated at any time for reasons including:\n\u2022\nongoing discussions with the FDA or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials, including discussions with the FDA regarding initiation of our planned Phase 3 trial of aldafermin;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, required approvals from institutional review boards, or IRBs, or other governing entities at clinical trial sites selected for participation in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays in key trial activities and patient enrollment, including as a result of the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs;\n\u2022\ndeviations from the trial protocol by clinical trial sites and investigators, or failures to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nlower than anticipated retention rates of participants in clinical trials, including patients dropping out due to side effects, disease progression or concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\ndelays in patients completing a trial or returning for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\nfailure of third parties, such as CROs, to satisfy their contractual duties to us or meet expected deadlines;\n\u2022\nfor clinical trials in selected patient populations, delays in identification and auditing of central or other laboratories and the transfer and validation of assays or tests to be used to identify selected patients and test any patient samples;\n\u2022\nimplementation of new, or changes to, guidance or interpretations from the FDA or comparable foreign authorities with respect to approval pathways for product candidates we are pursuing;\n\u2022\nthe need to repeat clinical trials as a result of inconclusive or negative results, poorly executed testing or changes in required endpoints;\n\u2022\ninsufficient supply or deficient quality of drug substance, drug product or other clinical trial material necessary to conduct our clinical trials, as well as delays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery to clinical trial sites of such material;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial sites or investigators from our clinical trials for any reason, including as a result of changing standards of care or the ineligibility of a site to participate in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nunfavorable FDA or comparable foreign authority inspection or review of a clinical trial site or records of any clinical or preclinical investigation;\n\u2022\ndrug-related adverse effects or tolerability issues experienced by participants in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour ability to hire and retain key R&D personnel; or\n\u2022\nthe placement of a clinical hold on a trial by the FDA or comparable foreign authorities.\nIn particular, we or our partners may be unable to enroll the patients we need to complete clinical trials on a timely basis, or at all. For example, there is significant competition for recruiting patients with NASH in clinical trials. In the first quarter of 2020, we announced that enrollment in our ALPINE 2/3 clinical trial of aldafermin had been delayed beyond our initial projections. In addition, clinical trial enrollment generally continues to be negatively affected by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including in our ongoing ALPINE 4, CATALINA and NGM120 trials, as a result of delays in additional clinical trial site initiation, suspension of enrollment at clinical trial sites or patient reluctance to participate in a clinical trial during quarantines or shelter-in-place orders or otherwise, particularly in medically vulnerable patient populations. If the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic persist or become more severe, we could experience significant disruptions to our clinical development timelines, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully accomplish required regulatory and/or manufacturing activities or all of the other activities necessary to initiate and complete clinical trials. As a result, our preclinical studies and clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals or successfully commercialize our products. We also have only limited experience in conducting late-stage clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval. In any event, we do not know whether any of our clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all.\nOur product development costs will increase if we continue to experience delays in clinical testing. Significant clinical trial delays could also shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to\ncommercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which would impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business, results of operations and prospects. Our or our collaborators\u2019 inability to timely complete clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate product revenue or development, regulatory, commercialization and sales milestone payments and royalties on product sales.\nIf clinical trials of our product candidates fail to product positive results or to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nOur product candidates are in various stages of development and our most advanced product candidate, aldafermin, is still only in Phase 2 development. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidates, we or our collaborators must conduct extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidates in humans. Preclinical studies and clinical trials are expensive, take several years to complete and may not yield results that support further clinical development or product approvals. In addition, there is a high failure rate for drugs and biologic products proceeding through clinical trials and failure can occur at any stage of testing. Moreover, additional clinical trials may be required if clinical trial results are negative or inconclusive, which would require us to incur additional costs and significant delays. In addition, data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are subject to varying interpretations, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In any event, it is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove safe and effective in humans or will receive regulatory approval. Owing in part to the complexity of biological pathways, our product candidates might not demonstrate in patients the biochemical and pharmacological properties we anticipate based on laboratory studies or earlier-stage clinical trials, and they may interact with human biological systems or other drugs in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways.\nIn addition, the design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product, and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. Because we have limited experience designing clinical trials, we may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support regulatory approval.\nFurther, we expect that certain of our current product candidates will, and future product candidates may, require chronic administration. The need for chronic administration increases the risk that participants in our clinical trials will fail to comply with our dosing regimens. If participants fail to comply, we may not be able to generate clinical data in our trials acceptable to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. The need for chronic administration also increases the risk that our clinical drug development programs may not uncover all possible adverse events that patients who take our products may eventually experience. The number of patients exposed to treatment with, and the average exposure time to, our product candidates in clinical development programs may be inadequate to detect rare adverse events or chance findings that may only be detected once our products are administered to more patients and for longer periods of time.\nIf we are unable to successfully discover, develop or enable our collaborators to develop drugs that are effective and safe in humans, we will not have a viable business.\nOur most advanced clinical-stage product candidate, aldafermin, and MK-3655, which is being developed by our collaborator, Merck, are being developed for the treatment of NASH, an indication for which there are no approved products. This makes it difficult to predict the timing, cost and potential success of their clinical development and regulatory approval for the treatment of NASH.\nWe are developing aldafermin, and our collaborator is developing MK-3655, for the treatment of NASH, an indication for which there are no approved products. Implementation of new, or changes to, guidance or interpretations from the FDA or comparable foreign authorities with respect to approval pathways, such as draft guidance documents from the FDA for the development of products for the treatment of NASH that issued in 2018 and 2019 and from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, that issued in 2018, may impact the path for regulatory approval for NASH therapies. Further, as we and other companies advance clinical trials for potential NASH therapies, we expect that the path for regulatory approval for NASH therapies may continue to evolve as companies refine their regulatory approval strategies and interact with regulatory authorities. Such evolution may impact our future clinical trial designs, including trial size and endpoints, in ways that we cannot currently predict.\nIn addition, certain of our competitors have recently experienced regulatory setbacks for NASH therapies following communications from the FDA. We currently do not know the impact, if any, that these setbacks could have on the path for regulatory approval for NASH therapies generally or for aldafermin and MK-3655 in particular. If the clinical trials for aldafermin and MK-3655 are not designed in a manner that, even if successful, support regulatory approval due to shifting approval pathways or for other reasons, those product candidates may be delayed in obtaining approval or may never be approved which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.\nSuccess in preclinical studies or earlier-stage clinical trials may not be indicative of results in future clinical trials.\nTo date, the data supporting our drug discovery and development programs are derived from laboratory and preclinical studies and earlier-stage clinical trials. Success in preclinical studies and earlier-stage clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate the same results or otherwise provide adequate data to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of our product candidates. In this regard, despite the results reported in our Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials for aldafermin, in Phase 1 clinical trials for MK-3655, NGM621 and NGM120 and in preclinical studies for our other product candidates, including NGM707 and NGM438, future clinical trials in humans may show that one or more of our product candidates are not safe and effective, in which event we may need to abandon development of such product candidates. In fact, many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in preclinical studies and earlier-stage clinical trials. Similarly, preliminary data and interim results from clinical trials may not be predictive of final results. For example, the results we obtained in our Phase 1 trials of aldafermin and in our completed Phase 2 trial, including the data from the fourth and final 24-week expansion cohort of that trial in patients with NASH with fibrosis stage or, may not be indicative of the future results we obtain from our ongoing ALPINE 2/3 and ALPINE 4 trials and any Phase 3 trial. In addition, some of our clinical trials involve small patient populations, sometimes at single sites, and the results of these clinical trials may be subject to substantial variability and may not be indicative of either future interim results or final results.\nWe may not successfully identify new product candidates to expand our development pipeline.\nThe success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to identify and validate new therapeutic candidates, and to identify, develop and commercialize protein and antibody therapeutics. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources, and our research methodology may not successfully identify medically-relevant protein or antibody therapeutics or new product candidates. In addition, our drug discovery efforts tend to identify and select novel, untested proteins in the particular disease indication we are pursuing, which we may fail to validate after further research work. Moreover, our research efforts may initially show promise in discovering potential new protein and antibody therapeutics, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for multiple reasons. For example, potential product candidates may, on further study, be shown to have inadequate efficacy, harmful side effects, suboptimal drug profiles or other characteristics suggesting that they are unlikely to be commercially viable products. Our inability to successfully identify new product candidates to advance into clinical trials could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.\nWe are subject to many manufacturing risks, any of which could substantially increase our costs and limit supply of our product candidates and any future products.\nWe have limited process development capabilities and have access only to external manufacturing capabilities. We do not have, and we do not currently plan to acquire or develop, the facilities or capabilities to manufacture bulk drug substance or filled drug product for use in clinical trials or commercialization. Our reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product candidates or products ourselves, including risks related to reliance on third parties for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by third parties because of factors beyond our control (including a failure to manufacture our product candidates or any products we may eventually commercialize in accordance with our specifications) and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of agreements by third parties, based on their own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us. In addition, we do not have a long-term supply agreement with any third-party manufacturer.\nTo date, aldafermin and our other product candidates have been manufactured by third-party manufacturers solely for preclinical studies and relatively small clinical trials. These manufacturers may not be able to scale production to the larger quantities required for large clinical trials and for commercialization. In this regard, if any of our product candidates are approved by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for commercial sale, we or our collaborator may need to manufacture it in large quantities. We intend to use third-party manufacturers for commercial quantities of aldafermin, NGM120, NGM621, NGM707 and NGM438, to the extent we advance these product candidates, and will rely on Merck to determine whether to utilize a third-party manufacturer or Merck\u2019s internal manufacturing capacity for MK-3655 and other licensed product candidates. The process of manufacturing aldafermin and our other product candidates is complex, highly regulated and subject to several risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe process of manufacturing biologics is susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure, improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error and improper storage conditions. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in our products or in the manufacturing facilities in which our products are made, the manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and eliminate the contamination;\n\u2022\na third-party manufacturer of a product candidate subject to our collaboration with Merck may fail to qualify upon an audit by Merck;\n\u2022\nthe manufacturing facilities in which our products are made could be adversely affected by equipment failures, labor and raw material shortages, turnover of qualified staff, financial difficulties of our contract manufacturers, including as a result of the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, power failures, local political unrest and numerous other factors; and\n\u2022\nany adverse developments affecting manufacturing operations or the scale up of manufacturing operations for our products may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls or other interruptions in the supply of our product candidates. We may also have to record inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for product candidates or drug substances that fail to meet specifications or cannot be used before their expiration dates. In addition, for out of specification materials, we may need to undertake costly remediation efforts or seek costlier manufacturing alternatives.\nWe also have a single source of supply for aldafermin and most of our other product candidates, including the drug substances used in manufacturing them. Single sourcing minimizes our leverage with our contract manufacturers, who may take advantage of our reliance on them to increase the pricing of their manufacturing services. Single sourcing also imposes a risk of interruption in supply in the event of manufacturing, quality or compliance difficulties. In addition, we do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply for bulk drug substances or drug product. If one of our suppliers fails or refuses to supply us for any reason, it would take a significant amount of time and cost to implement and execute the necessary technology transfer to, and to qualify, a new supplier. The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority must approve manufacturers of drug substance and drug product. If there are any delays in qualifying new suppliers or facilities or a new supplier is unable to meet the requirements of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority for approval, there could be a shortage of drug substance or drug product for use in clinical trials with respect to the affected product candidates.\nIn addition, the operations of our third-party manufacturers may be requisitioned, diverted or allocated by U.S. or foreign government orders such as under emergency, disaster and civil defense declarations in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise. As an example, in 2020, the Defense Production Act was invoked pursuant to which the U.S. government may, among other things, require domestic industries to provide essential goods and services needed for the national defense, such as drug material or other supplies needed to treat COVID-19 patients or to produce or distribute vaccines, which could require our third-party manufacturers to allocate manufacturing capacity in a way that delays or interrupts our supply of clinical trial material.\nWe have entered into third-party supply agreements for the production of aldafermin for our clinical trials with Lonza Ltd, or Lonza, for Phase 3 and commercial supplies of the aldafermin drug substance. If our third-party suppliers, including Lonza or our aldafermin drug product manufacturer, are not able to provide us with sufficient\nquantities of aldafermin for our clinical trials on a timely basis, or at all, whether due to production shortages or other supply delays or interruptions resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, our clinical trials or regulatory approval may be delayed. In this regard, although significant portions of our research and development resources are focused, and will continue to be focused, on activities required to prepare aldafermin for potential regulatory approval for the treatment of NASH, including manufacturing of clinical trial material and preparation for potential Phase 3 testing, if Lonza and/or our drug product manufacturer experience difficulties in scaling production or experience product loss due to contamination, equipment failure, improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error, turnover of qualified staff or improper storage conditions, the potential Phase 3 testing of aldafermin would be delayed, perhaps substantially, which could materially and adversely affect our business. Moreover, our aldafermin drug product manufacturer has advised us that it could be required under orders of the U.S. government to allocate manufacturing capacity to the manufacture or distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. If Lonza and/or our aldafermin drug product manufacturer become subject to acts or orders of U.S. or foreign government entities to allocate manufacturing capacity to the manufacture or distribution of COVID-19 vaccines or medical supplies needed to treat COVID-19 patients, this could also delay, perhaps substantially, our ongoing and planned aldafermin trials, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nEach of our product candidates uses certain raw materials for its manufacture, such as reagents that support cell growth. Some of these materials only have a single supplier and are purchased as necessary without a long-term supply agreement in place. In addition, our drug products require the use of pre-filled syringes or syringe components which have been the subject of shortages amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic due to their use in, among other things, COVID-19 vaccine production. Any significant delay in the acquisition or decrease in the availability of these raw materials, pre-filled syringes or syringe components could considerably delay the manufacture of our product candidates or the conduct of our clinical trials, which could adversely impact the timing or completion of any ongoing and planned trials or the timing of regulatory approvals, if any, of our product candidates.\nThe manufacture of biologic products is complex, highly regulated and requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of biologic products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up and validating initial production and ensuring the avoidance of contamination. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product, quality assurance testing, operator error and shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. We cannot ensure that any stability or other issues relating to the manufacture of our product candidates will not occur in the future.\nAny delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial material could delay the completion of clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials at additional expense or terminate clinical trials completely.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or adverse events or have other properties or safety risks, which could delay or prevent continued clinical development or their regulatory approval or limit the commercial profile of any approved label.\nAdverse events, undesirable side effects or similar safety issues caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Additional clinical trials may be required to evaluate the safety profile of our product candidates. Patients in certain of our ongoing or planned clinical trials, particularly those with NASH with more advanced fibrosis and patients with cancer, also often commonly enter our trials with significant comorbidities or advanced life-threatening illness and/or are treated in the trial with our product candidate in combination with other medications, including chemotherapy or other approved cancer treatments. As a result, patients in our clinical trials can be expected to experience some adverse events, including death, or side effects that are not or may not be related to treatment with our product candidates. Nonetheless, the occurrence of adverse events or side effects, whether or not related to our product candidates, could impact the success of our clinical trials.\nIn clinical trials of aldafermin to date, a number of serious adverse events, or SAEs, most of which have been mostly classified as mild to moderate, have been reported in the aldafermin treatment arms of our completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of aldafermin, including one patient receiving aldafermin in Cohort 1\nof our Phase 2 clinical trial who experienced an SAE, acute pancreatitis, that was assessed as possibly related to aldafermin. Patients have also experienced, and we have reported, SAEs in our completed trials of MK-3655, NGM621 and NGM120. SAEs reported in our ongoing Phase 2 CATALINA trial of NGM621, which remains blinded, include worsening of vision in non-study eye. We expect that patients in our clinical trials will continue to experience adverse events and SAEs and we will continue to monitor those SAEs for any signals of concern regarding the safety and tolerability of our product candidates. If patients in any of our clinical trials experience a high or unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects, including particularly SAEs, it could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete their treatment in a clinical trial or result in failure to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates or product liability claims.\nIn addition, significant increases in serum levels of low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol were observed in clinical trials of aldafermin in patients with NASH and type 2 diabetes. Serum levels of LDL cholesterol were brought back to baseline levels with concomitant statin use in patients with NASH; however, the impact of these drug-induced changes in LDL cholesterol are unknown. Generally, sustained and prolonged LDL cholesterol elevations in untreated patients are associated with cardiovascular disease through atherosclerotic plaque development. While in Cohorts 2, 3 and 4 of our completed Phase 2 clinical trial of aldafermin we demonstrated the ability of concomitant statin use to mitigate the serum LDL cholesterol elevations driven by aldafermin activity, aldafermin\u2019s impact on LDL may negatively impact market acceptance of an approved aldafermin product.\nOur product candidates, including aldafermin, which is an engineered variant of the human hormone fibroblast growth factor 19, or FGF19, protein, are protein or antibody therapeutics. Protein and antibody therapeutics can sometimes induce host immune responses that can cause the production of anti-drug antibodies, or ADAs. In some cases, ADAs have no effect. In other cases, ADAs may neutralize the effectiveness of the product candidate, can require that higher doses be used to obtain a therapeutic effect or can cross react with substances naturally occurring in a subject\u2019s body which can cause unintended effects, including potential impacts on efficacy and adverse events. Some patients treated with aldafermin in our completed clinical trials have developed ADAs against aldafermin, and in some cases, those antibodies were neutralizing or appeared to cross react with the patient\u2019s naturally occurring FGF19. We are developing an assay to measure the presence of ADAs against aldafermin for our ongoing NASH program, which will need to be used to test patient samples and then evaluated by regulatory agencies. The presence of ADAs was also observed in our Phase 1 MK-3655 trial. If we or Merck as appropriate, are required to undertake substantial additional testing as a result of the detection of ADAs in subjects using aldafermin, MK-3655 or any other product candidate, the costs of our clinical trials may increase. If we or Merck determine that ADAs are causing safety or efficacy concerns when using any of our product candidates, we or Merck may need to delay or halt clinical trials of our product candidates and the affected product candidates may never obtain regulatory approval. We cannot provide assurance that the detection of ADAs will not be higher than we have observed historically or that observed rates will not later be found to limit drug exposure or cause adverse safety events, or that the detection of ADAs will not otherwise result in the non-approvability of any of our product candidates.\nIn clinical trials to date, NGM621 has been delivered to clinical sites in vials and then administered to patients using commercially available single-use syringes. The manufacturer of a commercially available single-use syringe widely used by ophthalmologists for IVT injections, including by most investigators in the Phase 2 CATALINA trial, has issued a notice that such single-use syringes should not be used for ocular medications due to an increased potential for adverse eye conditions. We have not experienced any safety concerns in our ongoing or completed NGM621 clinical trials relating to syringe use; however, we have communicated with the FDA and our study investigators regarding this issue and are evaluating alternative syringes that may be suitable for intraocular use. However, if any patient in our clinical trials experiences a safety event due to the use of these commercially available single-use syringes, we could be required to delay or halt our clinical trials or may be subject to product liability claims.\nFuture results of our trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects, SAEs, ADAs, safety issues or other negative or otherwise unexpected characteristics. The occurrence of those issues could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete their treatment in a clinical trial, result in failure to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates or product liability claims or impact market acceptance of our products. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects.\nOur most advanced clinical-stage product candidate, aldafermin, is a modified version of a human hormone that has been associated with liver cancer in rodent testing.\nThe aldafermin IND that we filed in February 2014 for type 2 diabetes was placed on clinical hold by the FDA Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products pending receipt of additional information relating to the potential risk of proliferative effects of aldafermin in the livers of non-human primates and mice based on concerns relating to the observation that human FGF19 can induce hepatocellular proliferation in rodents. We withdrew this IND in January 2015, as we determined that we would not further study aldafermin in type 2 diabetes after we analyzed the results of the Phase 2 clinical trial of aldafermin in type 2 diabetes and made the determination to pursue NASH and other liver indications. To date, the FDA Division of Hepatology and Nutrition, which is responsible for the NASH indication, has not requested any additional information regarding the potential for aldafermin to induce hepatocellular proliferation. We have received feedback from the FDA Carcinogenicity Assessment Committee that our preclinical data through six-month chronic toxicology studies in mice and monkeys support a single species, two-year carcinogenicity assessment in rats. The human hormone and the rodent ortholog for FGF19 share a sequence identity of approximately 50%, which means that the results of these studies of aldafermin in rats are not necessarily predictive of the potential risk of carcinogenicity in humans. To our knowledge, neither FGF19 nor any variant thereof other than aldafermin has ever been tested in humans. We believe we have identified a modified version of FGF19 that does not exhibit the cancer-causing effects of native human FGF19 in rodents. We believe that aldafermin will have a superior therapeutic profile to FGF19 based on preclinical data showing reduced fasting blood glucose levels, fed insulin levels and bile acid suppression in animals. However, we may be incorrect in these beliefs, and we cannot be sure that regulators will view our product candidate as safe or that physicians will view our product candidates as safe and superior to alternative treatments. Concerns about the association between FGF19 and liver cancer could have an adverse effect on our ability to develop and commercialize aldafermin.\nWe have no experience in sales, marketing and distribution and may have to enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions, which could prevent us from successfully commercializing our product candidates.\nWe currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. To commercialize our product candidates outside of the Merck collaboration, or to commercialize products subject to the Merck collaboration for which we may in the future exercise our co-detailing rights in the United States, we must either develop our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services for us. If we exercise our co-detailing rights in the United States with respect to the Merck collaboration, we will be responsible for the costs of fielding such a sales force, subject to partial offset pursuant to the formula by which profits are allocated, and the risks of attracting, retaining, motivating and ensuring the compliance of such a sales force with the various requirements of the Merck collaboration and applicable law. If we decide to market any of our products on our own, we will have to commit significant resources to developing a marketing and sales force and supporting distribution capabilities. If we decide to enter into arrangements with third parties for performance of these services, we may find that they are not available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are not able to establish and maintain successful arrangements with third parties or build our own sales and marketing infrastructure, we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates, which would adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nWe may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically and commercially promising or profitable product candidates.\nWe have limited technical, managerial and financial resources to determine which of our product candidates should proceed to initial clinical trials, later-stage clinical development and potential commercialization. We may make incorrect determinations in allocating resources among these product candidates. Our decisions to allocate our research and development, management and financial resources toward particular product candidates or therapeutic areas may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources from better opportunities. Similarly, our decisions to delay or terminate drug development programs, such as our decision to suspend activities related to NGM386, NGM395, NGM621 administered systemically and NGM217 to concentrate our resources on other product candidates, also may be incorrect and could cause us to miss valuable opportunities.\nUnder the current terms of our Collaboration Agreement with Merck, we have the right, exercisable during a specified period prior to the commencement of Phase 3 clinical testing of the applicable product candidate, to convert our economic participation from a milestones and net sales royalty arrangement into a cost and profit share arrangement. If we exercise the cost and profit share right, we have the ability to participate in a co-detailing relationship in the United States. Due to the limited exercise period, we may have to choose whether a product candidate will be subject to a cost and profit share arrangement before we have as much information as we would like, including whether and when such program may receive FDA approval of the applicable BLA. As a result of such incomplete information or due to incorrect analysis by us, we may select a cost and profit share program that later proves to have less commercial potential than an alternative, or none at all, or may pass on a cost and profit-sharing program that proves commercially successful.\nWe must attract and retain highly skilled employees in order to succeed. If we are not able to retain our current senior management team, especially Dr. Jin-Long Chen, or continue to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and business personnel, our business will suffer.\nTo succeed, we must recruit, retain, manage and motivate qualified clinical, scientific, technical and management personnel and we face significant competition for experienced personnel. If we do not succeed in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, particularly at the management level, it could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results. An important element of our strategy is to take advantage of the research and development expertise of our current management. The loss of any one of our executive officers, including, in particular, Dr. Jin-Long Chen, our Chief Scientific Officer, could result in a significant loss in the knowledge and experience that we, as an organization, possess and could cause significant delays, or outright failure, in the development and further commercialization of our product candidates.\nTo fully realize the research and development support committed under our collaboration with Merck, we will need to maintain a significant number of qualified research and development personnel. There is intense competition for qualified personnel, including management, in the technical fields in which we operate, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the successful research, development and future commercialization, if any, of our product candidates. In particular, the hiring environment in the San Francisco Bay Area, where we are headquartered, is extremely competitive. Many of the other pharmaceutical companies that we compete against for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high-quality candidates than what we have to offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high-quality personnel, the rate and success with which we can discover and develop product candidates and our business will be limited.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could adversely affect our operations.\nSince executing the Collaboration Agreement in 2015, we have significantly increased our headcount and advanced our pipeline and the complexity of our operations, which has placed a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure. We expect this strain to continue as we seek to maintain our growth and seek to obtain and manage relationships with third parties. Our ability to manage our operations and growth effectively depends upon the continual improvement of our procedures, remote work policies, reporting systems and operational, financial and management controls, particularly in light of the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We may not be able to expand or identify sufficiently-sized facilities to accommodate our growth, particularly given our location in South San Francisco, California and the current high demand for, and restricted supply of, research and development facilities in this market. We may not be able to implement administrative and operational improvements in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. If we do not meet these challenges, we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities, execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures, which in turn may slow our growth or give rise to inefficiencies that would increase our losses.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than us.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our competitors include multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialized biotechnology companies\nand universities and other research institutions. A number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are pursuing the development or marketing of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases that are targeted by our most advanced product candidates. It is probable that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for the treatment of liver and metabolic diseases, retinal diseases and cancer will increase. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market technologically superior products. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater experience than we have in undertaking preclinical studies and human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products and in obtaining regulatory approvals of human therapeutic products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining FDA approval for superior products or for other products that would compete with our product candidates. Many of our competitors have established distribution channels and commercial infrastructure to support the commercialization of their products, whereas we have no such channel or capabilities. In addition, many competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive collaborative relationships. Smaller and earlier-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.\nOur competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than us or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products and these competitors may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. If we are unable to compete effectively against these companies, then we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates or achieve a competitive position in the market. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nAlthough we believe there are no FDA-approved therapies that specifically target the signaling pathways that our current product candidates are designed to modulate or inhibit, there are numerous currently approved therapies for treating the same diseases or indications (other than NASH) for which our product candidates may be useful and many of these currently approved therapies act through mechanisms similar to our product candidates. Many of these approved drugs are well-established therapies or products and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products. We expect that if our product candidates are approved, they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products, including branded generic products. This may make it difficult for us to differentiate our products from currently approved therapies, which may adversely impact our business strategy. In addition, many companies are developing new therapeutics, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidates progress through clinical development. For more information regarding the competition that our most advanced product candidates face, or may face, see the discussion of specific competition for each product candidate in \u201cBusiness-Key Therapeutic Areas and Pipeline Programs\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur product candidates may not achieve adequate market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain adequate market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community. Demonstrating the safety and efficacy of our product candidates and obtaining regulatory approvals will not guarantee future revenue. The degree of market acceptance of any of our approved product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe timing of market introduction of the product candidate, as well as competitive products;\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved;\n\u2022\nacceptance of the product candidate as a safe and effective treatment by clinics and patients;\n\u2022\nthe potential and perceived advantages of the product candidate over alternative treatments, including any similar generic treatments;\n\u2022\nthe inclusion or exclusion of the product candidate from treatment guidelines established by various physician groups and the viewpoints of influential physicians with respect to the product candidate;\n\u2022\nthe cost of treatment relative to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by third parties and government authorities as described below;\n\u2022\nthe relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nthe frequency and severity of adverse events;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u2022\nany unfavorable publicity relating to the product candidate.\nFor example, aldafermin is currently administered via a once-daily subcutaneous injection. While we are undertaking efforts to develop formulations and presentations of aldafermin that allow for more convenient or less frequent dosing, there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful which may negatively impact market acceptance of an approved aldafermin product. In addition, see the risk factor titled \u201cOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or adverse events or have other properties or safety risks, which could delay or prevent continued clinical development or their regulatory approval or limit the commercial profile of any approved label\u201d above. If any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by such parties, we may not generate or derive sufficient revenue from that product candidate and may not become or remain profitable.\nEven if we commercialize any of our product candidates, alone or with our partners, these products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which could harm our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. In many regions, including Europe, Japan and Canada, the pricing of prescription drugs is controlled by the government. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. Regulatory agencies in those countries could determine that the pricing for our products should be based on prices of other commercially available drugs for the same disease, rather than allowing us to market our products at a premium as new drugs. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay or limit our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, which could negatively impact the revenue we generate from the sale of the product in that particular country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nOur commercial success also depends on coverage and adequate reimbursement of our product candidates by third-party payors, including government payors, private health insurers, health maintenance organizations and other organizations, which may be difficult or time-consuming to obtain, may be limited in scope and may not be obtained in all jurisdictions in which we may seek to market our products. Governments and private insurers closely examine medical products to determine whether they should be covered by reimbursement and, if so, the level of reimbursement that will apply. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that we or our partners commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we or our partners obtain marketing approval. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we and our\npartners may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which marketing approval is obtained.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including costs of research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may only be temporary. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nThe advancement of healthcare reform may negatively impact our ability to profitably sell our product candidates, if approved.\nThird-party payors, whether domestic or foreign, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. The United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product for which we obtain marketing approval.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively referred to as the ACA, was enacted, which includes measures that have significantly changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. There have been executive, judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA.\nIn addition, while Congress has not passed comprehensive legislation repealing the ACA, it has introduced legislation to modify certain provisions. Congress likely will consider other legislation to modify or replace additional elements of the ACA. It is unclear how these efforts to repeal and replace the ACA, or other appeals, will impact the ACA and our business. For example, the 2017 Tax Act repealed the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d In December 2019, a U.S. District Court upheld a ruling that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress. The Supreme Court of the United States is currently reviewing this case, although it is unclear when a decision will be made. It is also unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA or our business.\nRecently, there has also been increasing executive, legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. There have been U.S. congressional inquiries, presidential executive orders and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. We expect that the healthcare reform measures that have been adopted and may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product and could seriously harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.\nThere have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. It is also possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may\nsuccessfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.\nWe cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of healthcare reform initiatives that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, particularly under the new Biden administration. If we or any third parties we may engage are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we or such third parties are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, our product candidates may lose any regulatory approval that may have been obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur international operations may expose us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial, pricing and reimbursement risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with conducting business internationally. Some of our suppliers and clinical trial sites are located outside of the United States. Furthermore, if we, Merck or any future collaborator succeeds in developing any of our product candidates, we intend to market them in the European Union, or the EU, and other jurisdictions in addition to the United States. If approved, we, Merck or any future collaborator may hire sales representatives and conduct physician and patient association outreach activities outside of the United States. Doing business internationally involves a number of challenges and risks, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nmultiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations, such as privacy regulations, tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses;\n\u2022\nfailure by us to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for the use of our products in various countries;\n\u2022\nrejection or qualification of foreign clinical trial data by the competent authorities of other countries;\n\u2022\ndelays or interruptions in the supply of clinical trial material resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad, including those that may result from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nadditional potentially relevant third-party patent rights;\n\u2022\ncomplexities and difficulties in obtaining, maintaining, protecting and enforcing our intellectual property;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ncomplexities associated with managing multiple payor reimbursement regimes, government payors or patient self-pay systems;\n\u2022\nlimits on our ability to penetrate international markets;\n\u2022\nfinancial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable, the impact of local and regional financial crises on demand and payment for our products and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism and political unrest, outbreak of disease, including COVID-19 and related shelter-in-place orders, travel, social distancing and quarantine policies, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions; and\n\u2022\nregulatory and compliance risks that relate to anti-corruption compliance and record-keeping that may fall within the purview of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, its accounting provisions or its anti-bribery provisions or provisions of anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws in other countries.\nAny of these factors could harm our ongoing international clinical operations and supply chain, as well as any future international expansion and operations and, consequently, our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we or our collaborator commercializes any resulting products. Product liability claims may be brought against us by subjects enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, healthcare providers or others using, administering or selling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products that we may develop caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u2022\ntermination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial subjects or patients;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nOur clinical trial liability insurance coverage may not adequately cover all liabilities that we may incur. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. Our inability to obtain product liability insurance at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or delay the commercialization of any products or product candidates that we develop. We intend to expand our insurance coverage for products to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. If we are sued for any injury caused by our products, product candidates or processes, our liability could exceed our product liability insurance coverage and our total assets. Claims against us, regardless of their merit or potential outcome, may also generate negative publicity or hurt our ability to obtain physician endorsement of our products or expand our business.\nOur relationships with healthcare providers, customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations, which, if violated, could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, including physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we or our collaborator obtains marketing approval. Our arrangements with healthcare providers, third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, market, sell and distribute our products for which we or our collaborator obtains marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, the referral of an individual for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing, or the purchase, lease or order, or arranging for or recommending purchase, lease or order, of any good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nthe federal False Claims Act, or FCA, imposes criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense or knowingly and willfully making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations on certain covered entity healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information as well as their covered subcontractors, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal Open Payments program, created under Section 6002 of the ACA and its implementing regulations, requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, information related to \u201cpayments or other transfers of value\u201d made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to the HHS ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding its payments and transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, anesthesiologist assistants, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives during the previous year; and\n\u2022\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures or pricing; and state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, additional regulatory oversight, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, that person or entity may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nOur operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist activity and other events beyond our control, which could harm our business.\nOur facilities have experienced electrical blackouts as a result of a shortage of available electrical power. Future blackouts, which may be implemented by the local electricity provider in the face of high winds and dry conditions, could disrupt our operations. Our facility is located in a seismically active region. We have not undertaken a systematic analysis of the potential consequences to our business and financial results from a major earthquake, fire, power loss, terrorist activity or other disasters and do not have a comprehensive recovery plan for such disasters. In addition, we do not carry sufficient insurance to compensate us for actual losses from interruption of our business that may occur, and any losses or damages incurred by us could harm our business. In addition, the sole supplier of clinical drug substance for NGM120, NGM621, NGM707 and NGM438 is located in a region that has experienced political unrest. If our operations or the operations of third parties providing services to us experiences are disrupted by any such occurrences, our business and future prospects may be negatively affected.\nOur business is currently adversely affected and could be materially and adversely affected in the future by the effects of disease outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics, including by the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely impact our business and could materially and adversely affect our operations, as well as the businesses or operations of our manufacturers, CROs or other third parties with whom we conduct business.\nDisease outbreaks and epidemics in regions where we have concentrations of clinical trial sites or other business operations or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our business, including by causing significant disruptions in our operations and/or in the operations of third-party manufacturers and CROs upon whom we rely. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting employees, patients, communities and business operations, as well as the United States and international economy and financial markets. In this regard, the COVID-19 pandemic and government measures taken in response have had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as significant reductions in business-related activities have occurred, supply chains have been disrupted and manufacturing and clinical development activities have been curtailed or suspended.\nRemote work policies, quarantines, shelter-in-place and similar government orders, shutdowns or other restrictions on the conduct of business operations related to the COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our operations. Following guidance from federal, state and local authorities, we transitioned to a remote work environment for the vast majority of our employees in March 2020, while maintaining essential in-person laboratory work and other essential business functions in order to advance key research and development initiatives, supported by the implementation of updated onsite safety procedures. In June 2020, following updated guidance from federal, state and local authorities, we re-opened our laboratory facilities for research activities that cannot be conducted remotely with heightened safety measures designed to minimize occupational exposure and reduce transmission of COVID-19 within our workplace. Although we have re-opened our laboratory facilities under these heightened safety measures, we may be forced to, or determine that we should, resume a more restrictive remote work model. In connection with these measures, we may be subject to claims based upon, arising out of or related to COVID-19 and our actions and responses thereto, including any determinations that we have made and may make in the future with respect to our onsite operations. Further, the effects of current and future governmental shelter-in-place orders and our remote work policies may materially and adversely impact productivity, disrupt our business and delay our clinical programs and timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course. For example, since we transitioned to a remote work model in March 2020, we experienced higher-than-normal employee turnover and an increased rate of hiring new employees. We cannot predict whether this higher turnover rate will continue and what its impact will be on productivity, whether these trends will continue or be exacerbated, when we will be permitted to return to an office-based working model or whether we will be required to adopt a more restrictive work model. Continuation of current or similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our operations could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nAs the pandemic continues, there may be continuing negative impacts on our ability to initiate new clinical trial sites, maintain enrollment of existing patients and enroll new patients, which may affect timelines in the\nfuture. Our ability to attract additional clinical trial sites and principal investigators to conduct our clinical trials and to conduct the necessary clinical trial site initiation procedures has been and may continue to be impacted by quarantines, shelter-in-place and similar restrictions imposed by federal, state and local governments. These restrictions may also continue to prohibit or discourage patients from enrolling in, or continuing to participate in, our clinical trials. Principal investigators and clinical trial site staff, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19 and if their health is impacted by COVID-19 it could adversely impact the conduct of our clinical trials at their sites. Similarly, potential participants in our clinical trials, many of whom are particularly vulnerable, may be unwilling to enroll in, and enrolled patients may be unwilling to continue to participate in, our clinical trials due to concerns about traveling to sites for required screening and clinical trial visits and procedures. In this regard, we have experienced, from to time, a slower pace of clinical site initiation and enrollment than anticipated in certain of our clinical trials, including the ALPINE 4, CATALINA and NGM120 trials, and we have experienced a higher dropout rate than anticipated in our ALPINE 2/3 trial after we completed enrollment, due to factors such as the vulnerability of our studied patient populations, clinical trial site suspensions, reallocation of medical resources and the challenges of working remotely due to shelter-in-place and similar government orders, among other factors. Enrolled patients may also be unable to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines, shelter-in-place and similar restrictions continue to impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. Accordingly, we have developed and implemented additional clinical study policies and procedures designed to help protect patients from COVID-19 exposure as a result of their trial participation, which include the use of telemedicine visits, remote monitoring of patients and clinical trial sites, and other measures designed to ensure that data from clinical trials that may be disrupted as result of the pandemic are collected pursuant to the study protocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs, with any material protocol deviation reviewed and approved by the clinical trial site IRB. If any of the foregoing efforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are not successful, or if the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic persist or become more severe, it could materially and adversely affect our clinical development timelines and our ability to obtain regulatory approvals of our product candidates and could significantly increase our costs.\nWe also could see an adverse impact on our ability to report clinical trial results, or interact with regulators, IRBs and ethics committees or other important agencies due to limitations in regulatory authority employee resources or otherwise. Moreover, we rely on CROs and other third parties to assist us with clinical development activities, and we cannot guarantee that they will continue to perform their contractual duties in a timely and satisfactory manner as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nQuarantines, shelter-in-place and similar government orders could impact personnel at third-party manufacturing facilities in the United States and other countries, or the availability or cost of materials, which would disrupt our supply chain and delay our clinical development efforts. Likewise, the operations of our third-party manufacturers may be requisitioned, diverted or allocated by U.S. or foreign government orders such as under emergency, disaster and civil defense declarations in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise. Refer the risk factor titled \u201cWe are subject to many manufacturing risks, any of which could substantially increase our costs and limit supply of our product candidates and any future products.\u201d In any event, if the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic persist or become more severe or more acutely impact geographies with particular relevance to our business, we could experience significant disruptions to our current and potential future clinical development timelines, impacts on our ability to obtain regulatory approvals of our product candidates and increases in our costs, all or any of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWhile the potential economic impact caused by, and the duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic could result in significant and prolonged disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect the financial resources available to us. In addition, the current recession or additional market corrections resulting from, among other things, the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock. We also cannot predict how the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may influence the future decisions of Merck to license any programs available to it under the Collaboration Agreement, to exercise its remaining option to extend the research phase of the collaboration beyond March 16, 2022 or to reach agreement with us on the terms of a modified collaboration, if any.\nWhile we expect the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to affect our business operations, the extent of the impact on our clinical development and regulatory efforts, our ability to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, if at all, the decisions of Merck and the value of and market for our common stock will depend\non future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time. Such developments include the ultimate duration and severity of the pandemic, travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing and business closure requirements in the United States and in other countries, and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain and treat COVID-19. To the extent the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and results of operations, it also may have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this \u2018\u2018Risk Factors\u2019\u2019 section.\nWe, our CROs, our CMOs and other third parties we rely on could experience a cybersecurity incident that could harm our business.\nWe collect, store and transmit proprietary, confidential and sensitive information, including personal information in the course of our business. The information and data processed and stored in our technology systems, and those of our research collaborators, CROs, CMOs, contractors, consultants and other third parties on which we depend to operate our business, may be vulnerable to security breaches, loss, damage, corruption, unauthorized access, use or disclosure, or misappropriation. Such incidents also may result from errors or malfeasance by our personnel or the personnel of the third parties we work with, malware, viruses, software vulnerabilities, hacking, denial of service attacks, social engineering (including phishing), ransomware, credential stuffing or other cyberattacks, including attacks by state-sponsored organizations or sophisticated groups of hackers.\nWhile we have developed systems and processes designed to protect the integrity, confidentiality and security of the confidential and personal information under our control, we cannot assure you that any security measures that we or our third-party service providers have implemented will be effective in preventing cybersecurity incidents. There are many different cyber-crime and hacking techniques, and as such techniques continue to evolve, we may be unable to anticipate attempted security breaches, identify them before our information is exploited or react in a timely manner.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, certain functional areas of our workforce remain in a remote work environment and outside of our corporate network security protection boundaries, which imposes additional risks to our business, including increased risk of industrial espionage, phishing and other cybersecurity attacks, and unauthorized dissemination of proprietary or confidential information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDespite our efforts to strengthen security and authentication measures, we have experienced an overall increase in cybersecurity incidents, none of which have caused material disruption to our business, or to our knowledge, involved a material security breach. In June 2019, a vendor that conducted bioanalytical services for some of our aldafermin clinical trials experienced a ransomware attack that resulted in a significant disruption to its IT systems but did not affect the integrity of our clinical sample data for aldafermin, as verified by independent vendors. More recently, in December 2020, we detected that an attacker had gained access to a single system on our network and unsuccessfully attempted to use that access to stage a broader attack against us. We or the third parties we rely on could experience a material system failure, security breach or other cybersecurity incident in the future, which could interrupt our operations disrupt our development programs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the loss or corruption of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates, to analyze clinical trial samples and to conduct clinical trials, and cybersecurity incidents experienced by these third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business. Security breaches and other cybersecurity incidents affecting us or the third parties we rely on could also result in substantial remediation costs and expose us to litigation, regulatory enforcement action, fines, penalties and other liabilities.\nWe cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data security liabilities actually incurred, will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to rapidly changing and increasingly stringent foreign and domestic laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection. The restrictions imposed by these requirements or our failure to comply with them could harm our business.\nWe may collect, use or transfer personal information from clinical trials participants and other individuals located in the EU. Additionally, if any of our product candidates are approved, we may seek to commercialize those products in the EU. The collection and use of personal information, including health data, in the EU and EEA are governed by the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679), or GDPR. Companies that violate the GDPR can face private litigation, prohibitions on data processing and fines of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of their worldwide annual revenue. The GDPR requires us to give detailed disclosures about how we collect, use and share personal information; contractually commit to data protection measures in our contracts with vendors; maintain adequate data security measures; notify regulators and affected individuals of certain data breaches; meet extensive privacy governance and documentation requirements; and honor individuals\u2019 data protection rights, including their rights to access, correct and delete their personal information.\nEuropean data protection laws, including the GDPR, generally restrict the transfer of personal information from Europe, including the European Economic Area, United Kingdom and Switzerland, to the United States and most other countries unless the receiving country offers comparable data protection laws. Decisions by the Court of Justice of the European Union, or CJEU, indicate that the United States does not offer adequate data protection that is comparable to the GDPR; however, one of the primary safeguards allowing United States companies to continue to import personal information from the EU has been the European Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses, or SCCs. SCCs are standard contractual obligations that may be entered between a party exporting personal information from the EU and a party receiving the personal information in a third country. The CJEU adopted a decision in July 2020 validating that the SCCs can lawfully be used for personal information transfers from the EU to the United States, provided that the party exporting personal information from the EU conduct an analysis of the level of data protection available and take additional steps to guarantee adequate data protection, if needed. If adequate data protection cannot be guaranteed, EU citizens may complain to the data protection authorities, which may require data transfer under the contract to be suspended.\nWe continue to monitor changes in European data protection laws; however, uncertainty remains regarding any future regulations, interpretations or guidance that may be issued by the European authorities. At present, we primarily rely on individuals\u2019 explicit consent to transfer their personal information from Europe to the United States and other countries, but in certain cases we have relied or may rely on the SCCs. If we are unable to rely on explicit consent to transfer individuals\u2019 personal information from Europe, which can be revoked, or implement another valid compliance solution, we will face increased exposure to substantial fines under European data protection laws as well as injunctions against the export and processing of personal information from Europe. Our inability to import personal information from the European Economic Area, United Kingdom or Switzerland may also restrict our clinical trial activities in Europe; limit our ability to collaborate with CROs, service providers, contractors and other companies subject to European data protection laws; and require us to increase our data processing capabilities in Europe at significant expense.\nIn addition, there is currently a lack of clarity regarding the process for transferring personal information from the EU to the United Kingdom in compliance with the GDPR in light of Brexit. Pursuant to a post-Brexit trade deal between the United Kingdom and the EU, transfers of personal information from the European Economic Area to the United Kingdom are not considered restricted transfers under the GDPR for a period of up to six months from January 1, 2021. However, unless the EU Commission makes an adequacy finding with respect to the United Kingdom before the end of that period, transfers of European personal information to the United Kingdom will require an approved compliance mechanism to render such transfers lawful under the GDPR. As of February 2021, the European Commission has launched a process towards the adoption of an adequacy decision for transfers of personal data from the EU to the United Kingdom, having concluded that the United Kingdom ensures an essentially equivalent level of protection to that guaranteed under the GDPR; however, uncertainty remains regarding how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom ultimately will be regulated after Brexit. The UK has incorporated an amended version of the GDPR into UK law, which is independent from but aligned with the EU\u2019s GDPR. Non-compliance with the UK data protection law may result in monetary penalties of up to \u00a317.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Additionally, other countries outside of Europe have enacted or are considering enacting similar cross-border data transfer restrictions and laws requiring local data residency, which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services and operating our business.\nPrivacy and data security laws in the United States are increasingly complex and changing rapidly. Just over a month after the GDPR took effect, the California legislature passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents certain rights similar to the individual rights given under the GDPR, including the right to access and delete their personal information, opt-out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations. Since the enactment of the CCPA, new privacy and data security laws have been proposed in more than half of the states and in United States Congress, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. The CCPA itself will expand substantially as a result of California voters approving a November 2020 ballot measure that adopted the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, which becomes fully effective on January 1, 2023, and will, among other things, create a new administrative agency to implement and enforce California\u2019s privacy laws. While certain clinical trials activities are exempt from the CCPA\u2019s requirements, other personal information that we handle may be subject to the CCPA, which may increase our compliance costs, exposure to regulatory enforcement action and other liabilities.\nWe use and generate materials that may expose us to material liability.\nOur research programs involve the use of hazardous materials, chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. We are subject to foreign, federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other matters, the use, manufacture, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. We may incur significant costs to comply with these current or future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from hazardous materials and may incur material liability as a result of such contamination or injury. In the event of an accident, an injured party may seek to hold us liable for any damages that result. Any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our workers\u2019 compensation, property and business interruption insurance and we may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, if at all. We currently carry no insurance specifically covering environmental claims.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approvals\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable. Our inability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates would substantially harm our business.\nCurrently, none of our product candidates has received regulatory approval and we do not expect our product candidates to be commercially available for several years, if at all. The time required to obtain approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of preclinical studies and clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations or the type and amount of preclinical and clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s development and may vary among jurisdictions. It is possible that none of our existing or future product candidates will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nOur product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval from the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\ndisagreement with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nfailure to demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u2022\nfailure of results of clinical trials to meet the level of statistical significance required for approval;\n\u2022\nfailure to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022\ndisagreement with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe insufficiency of data collected from clinical trials to support the submission and filing of a BLA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain approval of the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with whom we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; or\n\u2022\nchanges in the approval policies or regulations that render our preclinical and clinical data insufficient for approval.\nThe FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may require more information, including additional preclinical or clinical data, to support approval, which may delay or prevent approval and commercialization, or we may decide to abandon the development program for other reasons. If we obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate.\nThe FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition, and the FDA may grant accelerated approval based on a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. However, Fast Track designation does not guarantee, or in any way change the standards for, product approval. Accordingly, although aldafermin has received Fast Track designation from the FDA for NASH, we may not necessarily experience faster development timelines or achieve faster review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures.\nMany agents in development for NASH have, or are expected to, opt for an accelerated approval pathway and rely on surrogate endpoints for initial approval. If we seek accelerated approval for one of our product candidates, including aldafermin for NASH, based on a surrogate endpoint, the FDA may not accept such endpoint, may require additional studies or analysis or may not approve our product candidate on an accelerated basis, or at all. For example, in June 2020, Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Intercept, announced that it had received a complete response letter regarding its New Drug Application for obeticholic acid for the treatment of NASH, in which the FDA indicated that it had determined that the predicted benefit of obeticholic acid based on a surrogate histopathologic endpoint was uncertain and did not sufficiently outweigh the potential risks to support accelerated approval for the treatment of patients with liver fibrosis due to NASH. The FDA recommended that Intercept submit additional post-interim analysis efficacy and safety data from its ongoing Phase 3 study in support of potential accelerated approval and that the long-term outcomes phase of the study should continue.\nOur failure to obtain regulatory approval in international jurisdictions would prevent us from marketing our product candidates outside the United States.\nIf we or our collaborators succeed in developing any products, we intend to market them in the EU and other foreign jurisdictions in addition to the United States. In order to market and sell our products in other jurisdictions, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, we must secure product reimbursement approvals before regulatory authorities will approve the product for sale in that country. Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. Further, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries and regulatory approval in one country does not ensure approval in any other country, while a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. If we fail to obtain approval of any of our product candidates by regulatory authorities in another country, we will be unable to commercialize our product in that country, and the commercial prospects of that product candidate and our business prospects could decline.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, it would be subject to ongoing requirements by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities governing the manufacture, quality control, further development, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, import, export, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. The FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities will continue to closely monitor the safety profile of any product even after approval. If the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities become aware of new safety information after approval of any of our product candidates, they may require labeling changes or establishment of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy or similar strategy, impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance.\nIn addition, manufacturers of drug substance and drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. If we, our product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, or undesirable side effects caused by such products are identified, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022\nissue safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings about such product;\n\u2022\nmandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners;\n\u2022\nrequire that we conduct post-marketing studies;\n\u2022\nrequire us to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u2022\nsuspend marketing of, withdraw regulatory approval of or initiate a recall of such product;\n\u2022\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us;\n\u2022\nsuspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022\nseize or detain products or refuse to permit the import or export of products.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenue.\nAdvertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval in the United States will be heavily scrutinized by the FDA, Department of Justice, HHS, Office of Inspector General, state attorneys general, members of Congress and the public. Violations, including promotion of our products for unapproved (or off-label) uses, are subject to enforcement letters, inquiries and investigations and civil and criminal sanctions by the government. Additionally, comparable foreign regulatory authorities will heavily scrutinize advertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval outside of the United States.\nIn the United States, engaging in the impermissible promotion of our products for off-label uses can subject us to false claims litigation under federal and state statutes, which can lead to civil and criminal penalties and fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. These false claims statutes include the federal FCA, which allows any individual to bring a lawsuit against a pharmaceutical company on behalf of the federal government alleging submission of false or fraudulent claims, or causing to present such false or fraudulent claims, for payment by a federal program such as Medicare or Medicaid. If the government prevails in the lawsuit, the individual will share in any fines or settlement funds. Since 2004, these FCA lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies have increased significantly in volume and\nbreadth, leading to several substantial civil and criminal settlements regarding certain sales practices promoting off-label drug uses involving fines in excess of $1 billion. This growth in litigation has increased the risk that a pharmaceutical company will have to defend a false claim action, pay settlement fines or restitution, agree to comply with burdensome reporting and compliance obligations and be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. If we do not lawfully promote our approved products, we may become subject to such litigation and, if we do not successfully defend against such actions, those actions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe FDA\u2019s policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nEven if we are able to obtain regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates, if they exhibit harmful side effects after approval, our regulatory approvals could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for aldafermin or any of our other product candidates, we will have tested them in only a small number of patients during our clinical trials. If our applications for marketing are approved and more patients begin to use our product, new risks and side effects associated with our products may be discovered. As a result, regulatory authorities may revoke their approvals. If aldafermin is approved by the FDA based on a surrogate endpoint pursuant to accelerated approval regulations (Subpart E regulations), we will be required to conduct additional clinical trials establishing clinical benefit on the ultimate outcome of NASH. Additionally, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials, make changes in labeling of our product, reformulate our product or make changes and obtain new approvals for our and our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities for aldafermin and our other product candidates. We might have to withdraw or recall our products from the marketplace. We may also experience a significant drop in the potential sales of our product if and when regulatory approvals for such product are obtained, experience harm to our reputation in the marketplace or become subject to lawsuits, including class actions. Any of these results could decrease or prevent any sales of our approved product or substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing our product.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur success depends in significant part upon our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our products and technologies.\nOur success depends in significant part on our ability and the ability of our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators to establish and maintain adequate intellectual property covering the product candidates that we plan to develop. In addition to taking other steps designed to protect our intellectual property, we have applied for, and intend to continue applying for, patents with claims covering our technologies, processes and product candidates when and where we deem it appropriate to do so. However, the patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we and our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators may not be able to prepare, file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we or our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection for them. Pending and future patent applications filed by us or our current or future licensors\u2019, licensees\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 may not result in patents being issued that protect our technology or product candidates, or products resulting therefrom, in whole or in part, or that effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products.\nWe have filed numerous patent applications both in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions to obtain patent rights to our inventions, with claims directed to compositions-of-matter, methods of use, formulations, combination therapy and other technologies relating to our product candidates. There can be no assurance that any of these patent applications will issue as patents or, for those applications that do mature into patents, whether the claims of the patents will exclude others from making, using or selling our product or product candidates, or products or product candidates that are substantially similar to ours. In countries where we have\nnot and do not seek patent protection, third parties may be able to manufacture and sell products that are substantially similar or identical to our products or product candidates without our permission, and we may not be able to stop them from doing so.\nSimilar to other biotechnology companies, our patent position is generally highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. In this regard, we cannot be certain that we or our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators were the first to make an invention, or the first inventors to file a patent application claiming an invention in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications. In addition, even if patents are issued, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of our product candidates, any patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after the resulting products are commercialized. Moreover, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could weaken the ability of us and our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators to obtain new patents or to enforce existing patents and patents we may obtain in the future. In any event, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights and those of our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators are highly uncertain and may not effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products.\nIn some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain or enforce the patents, covering technology that we license from or license to third parties and may be reliant on our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators to perform these activities, which means that these patent applications may not be prosecuted, and these patents may not be enforced, in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators fail to establish, maintain, protect or enforce such patents and other intellectual property rights, such rights may be reduced or eliminated. If our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised.\nIn addition, the legal protection afforded to inventors and owners of intellectual property in countries outside of the United States may not be as broad or effective as that in the United States and we may be unable to acquire and enforce intellectual property rights outside the United States to the same extent as in the United States, if at all. Accordingly, our efforts, and those of our licensors, licensees or collaborators, to enforce intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we own or license.\nWe do not currently own or have a license to any issued patents that cover our NGM621 product candidate, although it is disclosed and claimed in our pending U.S. non-provisional and/or national stage applications in particular foreign countries. Likewise, we do not currently own or have a license to any issued patents that cover our NGM707 and NGM438 product candidates, although these product candidates are disclosed and claimed in our pending U.S. provisional applications. The patent landscape surrounding all of our product candidates is crowded, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure patent protection that would adequately cover such product candidates, nor can there be any assurance that we would obtain sufficiently broad claims to be able to prevent others from selling competing products.\nAny changes we make to our product candidates to cause them to have what we view as more advantageous properties may not be covered by our existing patents and patent applications, and we may be required to file new patent applications and/or seek other forms of protection for any such altered product candidates. The patent landscape surrounding the technology underlying our product candidates is crowded, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure patent protection that would adequately cover an alternative to our aldafermin molecule, including half-life extending formulation enhancements or the half-life extended variants of FGF19 that we are developing, NGM621, NGM707 and NGM438 or any of our other product candidates.\nWe may be unable to obtain intellectual property rights or technologies necessary to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nSeveral third parties are actively researching and seeking and obtaining patent protection in the liver and metabolic diseases, retinal diseases and cancer fields, and there are issued third-party patents and published third-party patent applications in these fields. The patent landscape around our product candidates is complex, and we are aware of several third-party patents and patent applications containing claims directed to\ncompositions-of-matter, methods of use and related subject matter, some of which pertain, at least in part, to subject matter that might be relevant to our product candidates. However, we may not be aware of all third-party intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product candidates and technologies.\nDepending on what patent claims ultimately issue and how courts construe the issued patent claims, as well as the ultimate formulation and method of use of our product candidates, we may need to obtain a license to practice the technology claimed in such patents. There can be no assurance that such licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights or maintain the existing rights to third-party intellectual property rights we have, we might be unable to develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe could lose the ability to continue the development and commercialization of our products or product candidates if we breach any license agreement related to those products or product candidates.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability, and the ability of our current and future licensors, licensees and collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products and product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. A third party may hold intellectual property rights, including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development of our products. As a result, we are a party to a number of technology and patent licenses that are important to our business and we expect to enter into additional licenses in the future. If we fail to comply with the obligations under these agreements, including payment and diligence obligations, our licensors may have the right to terminate these agreements. In the event of a termination of these agreements, we may not be able to develop, manufacture, market or sell any product that is covered by these agreements or to engage in any other activities necessary to our business that require the freedom-to-operate afforded by the agreements, or we may face other penalties under the agreements. For example, we are party to license agreements with multiple vendors, including our licenses with Horizon and Lonza, under which we license cell lines and other technology used to produce multiple product candidates, including some that are currently subject to our collaboration with Merck. We require prior consent from some of these vendors to grant sub-licenses under these agreements. Therefore, these vendors may be able to prevent us from granting sub-licenses to third parties, which could affect our ability or Merck\u2019s ability to use certain desired manufacturers in order to manufacture our product candidates. In the event of a termination of our license agreements, our ability or Merck\u2019s ability to manufacture or develop any product candidates covered by these agreements may be limited or halted unless we can develop or obtain the rights to technology necessary to produce these product candidates.\nAny of the foregoing could materially adversely affect the value of the product or product candidate being developed under any such agreement. Termination of these agreements or reduction or elimination of our rights under these agreements may result in our having to negotiate new or amended agreements, which may not be available to us on equally favorable terms, or at all, or cause us to lose our rights under these agreements, including our rights to intellectual property or technology important to our development programs.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits or other proceedings to protect or enforce our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful and have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nThird parties may infringe patents or misappropriate or otherwise violate intellectual property rights owned or controlled by us or our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators. In the future, it may be necessary to initiate legal proceedings to enforce or defend these intellectual property rights, to protect trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of intellectual property rights that are owned or controlled by us or our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, which could harm our business and financial results.\nIf we or our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators initiated legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering a product candidate, the defendant could counterclaim that such patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. In an infringement or\ndeclaratory judgment proceeding, a court may decide that a patent owned by or licensed to us or our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that the patent does not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of the patents at risk of being invalidated, narrowed, held unenforceable or interpreted in such a manner that would not preclude third parties from entering the market with competing products.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings against us or our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators to challenge the validity or scope of intellectual property rights we own or control. For example, generic or biosimilar drug manufacturers or other competitors or third parties may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of patents owned or controlled by us or our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators. These proceedings can be expensive, lengthy and time-consuming, and many of our adversaries may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to prosecuting these legal actions than us. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we or our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating intellectual property rights we own, control or have rights to, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.\nThere is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation because of the substantial amount of discovery required. Additionally, many foreign jurisdictions have rules of discovery that are different than those in the United States and that may make defending or enforcing our patents extremely difficult. There also could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock.\nThird-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO, opposition, derivation, revocation, reexamination, inter partes review or interference proceedings, or other pre-issuance or post-grant proceedings, as well as other patent office proceedings or litigation in the United States or other jurisdictions brought by third parties against patents or patent applications owned or controlled by us or our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators, may be necessary to determine the inventorship, priority, patentability or validity of these patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could leave our technology or product candidates without patent protection and allow third parties to commercialize our technology or product candidates without payment to us. Additionally, potential licensees or collaborators could be dissuaded from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened. Even if we successfully defend such litigation or proceeding, we may incur substantial costs and it may distract our management and other employees.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property rights or we may initiate legal proceedings against third parties to challenge the validity or scope of the third-party intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings against us or our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators alleging that we infringe their intellectual property rights. Alternatively, we may initiate legal proceedings to challenge the validity or scope of intellectual property rights controlled by third parties, including in oppositions, interferences, revocations, reexaminations, inter partes review or derivation proceedings before the USPTO or its counterparts in other jurisdictions. In this regard, we are aware of several third-party patents and patent applications containing claims directed to compositions-of-matter, methods of use and related subject matter, some of which pertain, at least in part, to subject matter that might be relevant to our product candidates. These proceedings can be expensive, lengthy and time-consuming, and many of our adversaries may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to prosecuting these legal actions than us.\nIn addition, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees have used or disclosed confidential information or intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer, or that third parties have an interest in our patents as an inventor or co-inventor. Likewise, we and our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our owned or in-licensed patents, trade secrets, or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nEven if we believe third-party intellectual property claims are without merit, there is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement, validity, enforceability or priority. In order to successfully challenge the validity of any such U.S. patent in federal court, we would need to overcome a presumption of validity in favor of the granted third party patent. This is a high burden, requiring us to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of any such U.S. patent claim.\nAn unfavorable outcome in any such proceeding could require us and our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators to cease using the related technology or developing or commercializing the product or product candidate, or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Additionally, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly from time to time, for example, varying between a high of $32.05 on December 30, 2020 and a low of $8.81 on October 7, 2019. The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which we cannot control. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, these factors include:\n\u2022\ndevelopments associated with our collaboration with Merck, including our failure to reach agreement with Merck on the terms of a modified collaboration, Merck\u2019s decision to not exercise its remaining unilateral option to extend the research phase of the collaboration, investor perceptions as to the terms of a modified Collaboration Agreement, if any, or any termination of the collaboration;\n\u2022\nthe success of competitive products or technologies, including disclosure of interim data by our competitors;\n\u2022\nregulatory actions with respect to our product candidates or our competitors\u2019 product candidates or products;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\ntimeline delays in our clinical trials, including delays resulting from the evolving effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors or collaborators of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nregulatory, legal or payor developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u2022\nthe results of our efforts to in-license or acquire additional product candidates or products;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022\nannouncement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and The Nasdaq Global Select Market and biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies, including in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in decreased stock prices for many companies notwithstanding the lack of a fundamental change in their underlying business models or prospects. Broad market and industry factors, including worsening economic conditions and other adverse effects or developments relating to the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nBecause of potential volatility in our trading price and trading volume, we may incur significant costs from class action securities litigation.\nHolders of stock in companies that have a volatile stock price frequently bring securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. If any of our stockholders were to bring a lawsuit of this type against us, even if the lawsuit is without merit, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the time and attention of our management could be diverted from other business concerns, either of which could seriously harm our business. Refer also to the risk factor entitled \u201cSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\u201d\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nOur common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cNGM\u201d and trades on that market. We cannot ensure that an active trading market for our common stock will be sustained. Accordingly, we cannot ensure the liquidity of any trading market, your ability to sell your shares of our common stock when desired or the prices that you may obtain for your shares.\nOur principal stockholders, including entities affiliated with The Column Group, Merck and management, own a substantial percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nOur executive officers, directors, significant stockholders, including entities affiliated with The Column Group and Merck, and their respective affiliates beneficially own a substantial amount of our voting stock. These stockholders may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents or approval of any merger, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders. In addition, if any of our significant stockholders decide to sell a meaningful amount of their ownership position and there is not sufficient demand in the market for such stocks, our stock price could fall.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act and will be able to avail ourselves of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFor so long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended, the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various requirements applicable to public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including:\n\u2022\nthe provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requiring that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nthe \u201csay on pay\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding stockholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive officers) and the \u201csay on golden parachute\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding stockholder vote to approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and certain other business combinations) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, and some of the disclosure requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to compensation of our chief executive officer; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement to provide detailed compensation discussion and analysis in proxy statements and reports filed under the Exchange Act, and instead provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation.\nBecause our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d the risk that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected may be increased. Likewise, our election not to provide certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of our executive officers, that we would otherwise have been required to provide in filings we make with the SEC, may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our company.\nWe may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, which in certain circumstances could be for up to five years. We will cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d upon the earliest of: (1) December 31, 2024; (2) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenue is $1.07 billion or more; (3) the date on which we have, during the previous rolling three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities; and (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act.\nWith respect to the JOBS Act, we are also taking advantage of some, but not all, of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are available to us so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d For example, we are not subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d As a result, changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or their interpretation, the adoption of new guidance or the application of existing guidance to changes in our business could significantly affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions and reduced requirements. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile and may decline. In addition, if we lose our \u201cemerging growth company\u201d status sooner than anticipated, we may incur additional costs to comply with rules and regulations required for public companies, which may impact our financial position and results of operations.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nFor the trading days during the three months ended December 31, 2020, the average daily trading volume for our common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market was only 175,778 shares. As a result, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, including pursuant to the Sales Agreement or the perception in the market that we or the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, as a result of the low trading volume of\nour common stock, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our stockholders could disproportionately influence the market price of our common stock in either direction. The price for our shares could, for example, decline significantly in the event that a large number of shares of our common stock are sold on the market without commensurate demand, as compared to an issuer with a higher trading volume that could better absorb those sales without an adverse impact on its stock price. Moreover, certain holders of our common stock have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock, if any.\nSome provisions of our charter documents, Delaware law and our agreement with Merck may have anti-takeover effects or could otherwise discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would benefit our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, or to remove our current management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na board of directors divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms, such that not all members of the board will be elected at one time;\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which we may establish and shares of which we may issue without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow for less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management. Because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, which is generally a person that together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nCertain provisions in our agreement with Merck may also deter a change of control. For example, under the current terms of our agreement with Merck, a change of control gives Merck the right to terminate the research phase of the collaboration as well as additional rights if our acquirer is a qualifying large pharmaceutical company or has a research, development or commercialization program that competes with a program licensed by Merck.\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, Delaware law or our agreement with Merck that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of a fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions.\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could seriously harm our business.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nNew tax laws or regulations, changes to existing tax laws or regulations or changes in their application to us or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.\nNew income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. For example, the 2017 Tax Act sanctioned many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws. Future guidance from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and other tax authorities with respect to the 2017 Tax Act may affect us, and certain aspects of the 2017 Tax Act may be repealed or modified in future legislation. For example, the CARES Act modified certain provisions of the 2017 Tax Act. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of net deferred tax assets relating to our operations, the taxation of foreign earnings and the deductibility of expenses under the 2017 Tax Act or future reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges and could increase our future U.S. tax expense.\nFuture changes in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse and unexpected revenue fluctuations and adversely affect our reported results of operations.\nFuture changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse, unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported financial position or results of operations. Financial accounting standards in the United States are constantly under review and new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred frequently in the past and are expected to occur again in the future. As a result, we may be required to make changes in our accounting policies. Those changes could affect our financial condition and results of operations or the way in which such financial condition and results of operations are reported. Compliance with new accounting standards may also result in additional expenses. As a result, we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from business activities to compliance activities.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management devotes substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, and these expenses may increase even more after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as rules adopted, and to be adopted, by the SEC and The Nasdaq Global Select Market. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and may make some activities more time-consuming and costly. The increased costs will increase our net loss. For example, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain sufficient coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur in the future to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nSpecifically, in order to comply with the requirements of being a public company, we need to undertake various actions, including implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring new accounting or internal audit staff. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations. In the event that we are not able to demonstrate compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, that our internal control over financial reporting is perceived as inadequate or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our operating results and the price of our common stock could decline. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nWe designed our disclosure controls and procedures to reasonably assure that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls.\nAccordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nOur stock price and trading volume is heavily influenced by the way analysts and investors interpret our clinical trial results, financial information and other disclosures. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, delay publishing reports about our business or publish negative reports about our business, regardless of accuracy, our stock price and trading volume could decline.", "PERMNO": 18561, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "NGM"}
