{"cik": "1326428", "company": "LINN ENERGY, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business has many risks. Factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or liquidity and the trading price of our shares are described below. This information should be considered carefully, together with other information in this report and other reports and materials we file with the SEC.\nRisks Related to Emergence from Bankruptcy\nWe recently emerged from bankruptcy, which could adversely affect our business and relationships.\nIt is possible that our having filed for bankruptcy and our recent emergence from the bankruptcy could adversely affect our business and relationships with customers, vendors, royalty and working interest owners, employees, service providers and suppliers. Due to uncertainties, many risks exist, including the following:\n\u2022\nvendors or other contract counterparties could terminate their relationship or require financial assurances or enhanced performance;\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\n\u2022\nthe ability to renew existing contracts and compete for new business may be adversely affected;\n\u2022\nthe ability to attract, motivate and/or retain key executives and employees may be adversely affected;\n\u2022\nemployees may be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other employment opportunities; and\n\u2022\ncompetitors may take business away from us, and our ability to attract and retain customers may be negatively impacted.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and reputation. We cannot assure you that having been subject to bankruptcy protection will not adversely affect our operations in the future.\nOur actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy may not reflect historical trends.\nIn connection with the disclosure statement we filed with the Bankruptcy Court, and the hearing to consider confirmation of the LINN Plan, we prepared projected financial information to demonstrate to the Bankruptcy Court the feasibility of the LINN Plan and our ability to continue operations upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Those projections were prepared solely for the purpose of the bankruptcy proceedings and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis. At the time they were prepared, the projections reflected numerous assumptions concerning our anticipated future performance with respect to prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions that were and remain beyond our control and that may not materialize. Projections are inherently subject to substantial and numerous uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and the assumptions underlying the projections and/or valuation estimates may prove to be wrong in material respects. Actual results will likely vary significantly from those contemplated by the projections. As a result, investors should not rely on those projections.\nIn addition, upon our emergence from bankruptcy, we will adopt fresh start accounting and, as a result, our assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value as of the fresh start reporting date, which may differ materially from the recorded values of assets and liabilities on our historical consolidated balance sheets. Our financial results after the application of fresh start accounting also may be different from historical trends. The lack of comparable historical financial information may discourage investors from purchasing our common stock.\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy, the composition of the Board of Directors changed significantly.\nPursuant to the LINN Plan, the composition of the Board of Directors changed significantly. Upon emergence, our Board of Directors will consist of seven directors, none of which, except for Mark E. Ellis, our President and Chief Executive Officer, previously served on the Board of Directors of the Predecessor. The new directors have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served on the Board of Directors and, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine the future of the Company. There is no guarantee that the new Board of Directors will pursue, or will pursue in the same manner, strategic plans consistent with those of the Predecessor. As a result, the future strategy and plans of the Company may differ materially from those of the past.\nThe ability of the new directors to quickly expand their knowledge of our business plans, operations and strategies in a timely manner will be critical to their ability to make informed decisions about Company strategy and operations. If our Board of Directors is not sufficiently informed to make such decisions, our ability to compete effectively and profitably could be adversely affected.\nThe ability to attract and retain key personnel is critical to the success of our business and may be affected by our emergence from bankruptcy.\nThe success of our business depends on key personnel. The ability to attract and retain these key personnel may be difficult in light of our emergence from bankruptcy, the uncertainties currently facing the business and changes we may make to the organizational structure to adjust to changing circumstances. We may need to enter into retention or other arrangements that could be costly to maintain. If executives, managers or other key personnel resign, retire or are terminated, or their service is otherwise interrupted, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner and we could experience significant declines in productivity.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nBusiness Risks\nCommodity prices are volatile, and prolonged depressed prices or a further decline in prices would reduce our revenues, profitability and net cash provided by operating activities and would significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenues, profitability, cash flow and the carrying value of our properties depend on the prices of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGL. Historically, the oil, natural gas and NGL markets have been very volatile and are expected to continue to be volatile in the future, and prolonged depressed prices or a further decline in prices will significantly affect our financial results and impede our growth. Changes in oil, natural gas and NGL prices have a significant impact on the value of our reserves and on our net cash provided by operating activities. In addition, revenues from certain wells may exceed production costs and nevertheless not generate sufficient return on capital. Prices for these commodities may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for them, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022\nthe domestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGL;\n\u2022\nthe price and level of foreign imports;\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer product demand;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\noverall domestic and global economic conditions;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic conditions in oil and natural gas producing countries;\n\u2022\nthe ability of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain price and production controls;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the U.S. dollar exchange rates on oil, natural gas and NGL prices;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation;\n\u2022\nthe impact of energy conservation efforts;\n\u2022\nthe proximity and capacity of pipelines and other transportation facilities; and\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels.\nProlonged depressed prices or a further decline in prices would reduce our revenues, profitability and net cash provided by operating activities and would significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe sustained oil, natural gas and NGL price declines have resulted in significant impairments of certain of our properties. Future declines in commodity prices, changes in expected capital development, increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance may result in additional write-downs of the carrying amounts of our assets, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period incurred.\nWe evaluate the impairment of our oil and natural gas properties on a field-by-field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded noncash impairment charges of approximately $165 million. Future declines in oil, natural gas and NGL prices, changes in expected capital development, increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance, among other things, may result in us having to make additional material write-downs of the carrying amounts of our assets, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period incurred.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets, continued low commodity prices and other factors may restrict our ability to raise capital on favorable terms, or at all.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets, in particular with respect to companies in the energy sector, could limit our ability to access these markets or may significantly increase our cost to borrow. Continued low commodity prices, among other factors, have caused some lenders to increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards which we may not satisfy, and in certain instances have reduced or ceased to provide funding to borrowers. If we are unable to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms or at all, it could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nWe may not be able to obtain funding under the Exit Facility because of a decrease in our borrowing base, or obtain new financing, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nHistorically, the Predecessor relied on borrowings under the Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \u201cLINN Credit Facility\u201d) to meet a portion of its capital needs. Pursuant to the LINN Plan, the LINN Credit Facility was paid down in part and replaced by the Credit Agreement (\u201cExit Facility\u201d) entered into in connection with the reorganization, which consists of a new reserve-based revolving loan with up to $1.4 billion in borrowing commitments and a new term loan in an original principal amount of $300 million. The initial borrowing base is subject to redetermination on April 1, 2018, and semiannual borrowing base redeterminations thereafter and may also be subject to certain additional redeterminations triggered by certain asset sales, casualty events, acquisitions, debt issuances and hedge terminations. Any reduction in the borrowing base will reduce our available liquidity, and, if the reduction results in the outstanding amount under the Exit Facility exceeding the borrowing base, we will be required to repay the deficiency. We may not have the financial resources in the future to make any mandatory deficiency principal prepayments required under the Exit Facility, which could result in an event of default.\nIn the future, we may not be able to access adequate funding under the Exit Facility as a result of (i) a decrease in our borrowing base due to the outcome of a borrowing base redetermination, or (ii) an unwillingness or inability on the part of our lending counterparties to meet their funding obligations. Since the process for determining the borrowing base under the Exit Facility involves evaluating the estimated value of some of our oil and natural gas properties using pricing models determined by the lenders at that time, a decline in those prices used, or further downward reductions of our reserves, likely will result in a redetermination of our borrowing base and a decrease in the available borrowing amount at the time of the next scheduled redetermination. In such case, we would be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the borrowing base.\nOur Exit Facility also restricts our ability to obtain new financing. If additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. If net cash provided by operating activities or cash available under our Exit Facility is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain such additional debt or equity financing could result in a curtailment of our development operations, which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves.\nWe may be unable to maintain compliance with the financial maintenance or other covenants in the Exit Facility, which could result in an event of default under the Exit Facility that, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nUnder the Exit Facility, we are required to maintain certain financial covenants including the maintenance of (i) an asset coverage ratio of at least 1.1 to 1.0, tested on (a) the date of each scheduled borrowing base redetermination commencing with the first scheduled borrowing base redetermination and (b) the date of each additional borrowing base redetermination done in conjunction with an asset sale and (ii) a maximum total net debt to last twelve months EBITDAX ratio of 6.75 to 1.0 for March 31, 2018 through December 31, 2018, 6.5 to 1.0 for March 31, 2019 through March 31, 2020, and 4.5 to 1.0 thereafter.\nIf we were to violate any of the covenants under the Exit Facility and were unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, it would be considered a default after the expiration of any applicable grace period. If we were in default under the Exit Facility, then the lenders may exercise certain remedies including, among others, declaring all outstanding borrowings immediately due and payable. This could adversely affect our operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations as they come due.\nRestrictive covenants in the Exit Facility could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital needs, respond to changing conditions and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests.\nRestrictive covenants in the Exit Facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincur additional liens;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and lease-back transactions;\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nmake certain capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our stock;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022\nengage or enter into any new lines of business;\n\u2022\nenter into certain marketing activities for hydrocarbons;\n\u2022\ncreate additional subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem, or repurchase certain of our indebtedness; and\n\u2022\namend or modify certain provisions of our organizational documents.\nThe Exit Facility also requires us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants as discussed above. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our Exit Facility. If a default occurs and remains uncured or unwaived, the administrative agent or majority lenders under the Exit Facility may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. The administrative agent or majority lenders under the Exit Facility would also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. If we are unable to repay our indebtedness when due or declared due, the administrative agent will also have the right to proceed against the collateral pledged to it to secure the indebtedness under the Exit Facility. If such indebtedness were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full our secured indebtedness.\nWe may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants in the Exit Facility. The restrictions contained in the Exit Facility could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to plan for, or react to, market conditions, to meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plan; and\n\u2022\nadversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nOur commodity derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our income, which may adversely affect our net cash provided by operating activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo achieve more predictable net cash provided by operating activities and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas, we have entered into commodity derivative contracts for a portion of our production. Commodity derivative arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including situations when production is less than expected. If we experience a sustained material interruption in our production or if we are unable to perform our drilling activity as planned, we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative obligations without the benefit of the sale of our underlying physical commodity, which may adversely affect our net cash provided by operating activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to hedge anticipated production volumes on attractive terms or at all, which would subject us to further potential commodity price uncertainty and could adversely affect our net cash provided by operating activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we have hedged a portion of our estimated production for 2017, 2018 and 2019, our anticipated production volumes remain mostly unhedged. Based on current expectations for future commodity prices, reduced hedging market liquidity and potential reduced counterparty willingness to enter into new hedges with us, we may be unable to hedge anticipated production volumes on attractive terms or at all, which would subject us to further potential commodity price uncertainty and could adversely affect our net cash provided by operating activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nCounterparty failure may adversely affect our derivative positions.\nWe cannot be assured that our counterparties will be able to perform under our derivative contracts. If a counterparty fails to perform and the derivative arrangement is terminated, our net cash provided by operating activities, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nUnless we replace our reserves, our future reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our net cash provided by operating activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nProducing oil, natural gas and NGL reservoirs are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending on reservoir characteristics and other factors. The overall rate of decline for our production will change if production from our existing wells declines in a different manner than we have estimated and may change when we drill additional wells, make acquisitions and under other circumstances. Thus, our future oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and production and, therefore, our cash flow and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs, which would adversely affect our net cash provided by operating activities, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, given restrictive covenants under our Exit Facility and general market conditions, we may be unable to finance potential acquisitions of reserves on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. Our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base of oil and natural gas reserves would be impaired to the extent cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable.\nOur estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nNo one can measure underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGL in an exact manner. Reserve engineering requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGL and assumptions concerning future oil, natural gas and NGL prices, production levels and operating and development costs. As a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate. An independent petroleum engineering firm prepares estimates of our proved reserves. Some of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history, which are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history. Also, we make certain assumptions regarding future oil, natural gas and NGL prices, production levels and operating and development costs that may prove incorrect. Any significant variance from these assumptions by actual amounts could greatly affect our estimates of reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL attributable to any particular group of properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows. Decreases in commodity prices can result in a reduction of our estimated reserves if development of those reserves would not be economic at those lower prices. Numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based, as described above, often result in the actual quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates.\nThe present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. We base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on an unweighted average of the first-day-of-the month price for each month during the 12-month calendar year and year-end costs. However, actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties also will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\nactual prices we receive for oil, natural gas and NGL;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of actual production;\n\u2022\ncapital and operating expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of development activities;\n\u2022\nsupply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGL; and\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nIn addition, the 10% discount factor required to be used under the provisions of applicable accounting standards when calculating discounted future net cash flows, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nOur development operations require substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could adversely affect our ability to sustain our operations at current levels and could lead to a decline in our reserves.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business for the development and production of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. These expenditures will reduce our cash available for other purposes. Our net cash provided by operating activities and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022\nour proved reserves;\n\u2022\nthe level of oil, natural gas and NGL we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u2022\nthe prices at which we are able to sell our oil, natural gas and NGL;\n\u2022\nthe level of operating expenses; and\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves.\nIf our net cash provided by operating activities decreases, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital or financing necessary to sustain our operations at current levels and could lead to a decline in our reserves.\nWe may decide not to drill some of the prospects we have identified, and locations that we decide to drill may not yield oil, natural gas and NGL in commercially viable quantities.\nOur prospective drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from a prospect that is ready to drill to a prospect that will require additional geological and engineering analysis. Based on a variety of factors, including future oil, natural gas and NGL prices, the generation of additional seismic or geological information, the current and future availability of drilling rigs and other factors, we may decide not to drill one or more of these prospects. In addition, the cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a well. Our efforts will be uneconomic if we drill dry holes or wells that are productive but do not produce enough oil, natural gas and NGL to be commercially viable after drilling, operating and other costs. As a result, we may not be able to increase or sustain our reserves or production, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDrilling for and producing oil, natural gas and NGL are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that we will not discover commercially productive reservoirs. Drilling for oil, natural gas and NGL can be uneconomic, not only from dry holes, but also from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to be commercially viable. In addition, our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of other factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe high cost, shortages or delivery delays of equipment and services;\n\u2022\nunexpected operational events;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\nfacility or equipment malfunctions;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\npipeline ruptures or spills;\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental requirements;\n\u2022\nunusual or unexpected geological formations;\n\u2022\nloss of drilling fluid circulation;\n\u2022\nformations with abnormal pressures;\n\u2022\nfires;\n\u2022\nblowouts, craterings and explosions; and\n\u2022\nuncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas and NGL or well fluids.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nAny of these events can cause increased costs or restrict our ability to drill the wells and conduct the operations which we currently have planned. Any delay in the drilling program or significant increase in costs could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate.\nOther companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest. As of December 31, 2016, nonoperated wells represented approximately 42% of our owned gross wells, or approximately 18% of our owned net wells. We have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties, including timing of drilling and other scheduled operations activities, compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them. The failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations, an operator\u2019s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator\u2019s failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues, and lead to unexpected future costs.\nOur business depends on gathering and transportation facilities. Any limitation in the availability of those facilities would interfere with our ability to market the oil, natural gas and NGL we produce, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe marketability of our oil, natural gas and NGL production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering systems and pipelines. The amount of oil, natural gas and NGL that can be produced and sold is subject to limitation in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, physical damage to the gathering or transportation system, or lack of contracted capacity on such systems. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months. In many cases, we are provided only with limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration. In addition, some of our wells are drilled in locations that are not serviced by gathering and transportation pipelines, or the gathering and transportation pipelines in the area may not have sufficient capacity to transport additional production. As a result, we may not be able to sell the oil, natural gas and NGL production from these wells until the necessary gathering and transportation systems are constructed. Any significant curtailment in gathering system or pipeline capacity, or significant delay in the construction of necessary gathering and transportation facilities, would interfere with our ability to market the oil, natural gas and NGL we produce, and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nRegulatory Risks\nBecause we handle oil, natural gas and NGL and other hydrocarbons, we may incur significant costs and liabilities in the future resulting from a failure to comply with new or existing environmental regulations or an accidental release of hazardous substances into the environment.\nThe operations of our wells, gathering systems, turbines, pipelines and other facilities are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. There is an inherent risk that we may incur environmental costs and liabilities due to the nature of our business, the substances we handle and the ownership or operation of our properties. Certain environmental statutes, including the RCRA, CERCLA and analogous state laws and regulations, impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed of or otherwise released. In addition, an accidental release from one of our wells or gathering pipelines could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations.\nMoreover, the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase our compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary, and these costs may not be recoverable from insurance. For a more detailed discussion of environmental and regulatory matters impacting our business, see Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Environmental Matters and Regulation.\u201d\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nWe are subject to complex and evolving federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nOur operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels. Environmental and other governmental laws and regulations have resulted in delays and increased the costs to plan, design, drill, install, operate and abandon oil and natural gas wells. Under these laws and regulations, we could also be liable for personal injuries, property damage and other damages. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, public interest in environmental protection has increased in recent years, and environmental organizations have opposed, with some success, certain drilling projects.\nPart of the regulatory environment in which we operate includes, in some cases, legal requirements for obtaining environmental assessments, environmental impact studies and/or plans of development before commencing drilling and production activities. In addition, our activities are subject to the regulations regarding conservation practices and protection of correlative rights. These regulations affect our operations and limit the quantity of oil, natural gas and NGL we may produce and sell. A major risk inherent in our drilling plans is the need to obtain drilling permits from state and local authorities. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or drilling permits, the failure to obtain a drilling permit for a well or the receipt of a permit with unreasonable conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our properties. Additionally, the regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase the financial and managerial costs of compliance with these laws and regulations and, consequently, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For a description of the laws and regulations that affect us, see Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Environmental Matters and Regulation.\u201d\nWe could also be affected by more stringent laws and regulations adopted in the future, including any related to climate change, engine emissions, greenhouse gases and hydraulic fracturing. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in delays or restrictions in permitting or development of projects or more stringent or costly construction, drilling, water management, or completion activities or waste handling, storage, transport, remediation or disposal, emission or discharge requirements could require significant expenditures by us or other operators of the properties to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Increased scrutiny of the oil and natural gas industry may occur as a result of the EPA\u2019s FY2017-2019 National Enforcement Initiatives, through which the EPA will purportedly address incidences of noncompliance from natural gas extraction and production activities that may cause or contribute to significant harm to public health and/or the environment.\nLegislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing, including with respect to seismic activity allegedly related to hydraulic fracturing, could adversely affect our business.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. For a description of the laws and regulations that affect us, including our hydraulic fracturing operations, see Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Environmental Matters and Regulation.\u201d If adopted, certain bills could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations. Any such added regulation could lead to operational delays, increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens, and reduced production of oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and net cash provided by operating activities.\nWe use a significant amount of water in our hydraulic fracturing operations. Our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our drilling and production operations, could adversely impact our operations. Moreover, new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the development or production of natural gas.\nFinally, in some instances, the operation of underground injection wells has been alleged to cause earthquakes in some of the states where we operate. Such issues have sometimes led to orders prohibiting continued injection in certain wells identified as possible sources of seismic activity. Such concerns also have resulted in stricter regulatory requirements in some jurisdictions relating to the location and operation of underground injection wells. Future orders or regulations addressing concerns about seismic activity from well injection could affect us, either directly or indirectly, depending on the wells affected.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nLegislation and regulation of greenhouse gases could adversely affect our business.\nIn December 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d (\u201cGHG\u201d) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA began adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d). The EPA has adopted three sets of rules regulating GHG emissions under the CAA, one that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles, a second that regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources under the CAA\u2019s Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V permitting programs, and a third that regulates GHG emissions from fossil fuel-burning power plants. In September 2015, the EPA published a proposed rule that would update and expand the New Source Performance Standards by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions from new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry. In May 2016, the EPA finalized rules that establish new controls for emissions of methane from new, modified or reconstructed sources in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities. The rule includes first-time standards to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas well completions. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the U.S., including, among other things, certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis. In addition, in 2015, the U.S. participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement requires countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. Legislation has from time to time been introduced in Congress that would establish measures restricting GHG emissions in the U.S. At the state level, almost one half of the states, including California, have begun taking actions to control and/or reduce emissions of GHGs. For a description of the California \u201ccap and trade\u201d program, see Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Environmental Matters and Regulation.\u201d Any such added regulation could lead to operational delays, increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens, and reduced production of oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and net cash provided by operating activities.\nUncertainty regarding derivatives legislation could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nTitle VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), enacted in 2010, expands federal oversight and regulation of the derivatives markets and entities, such as us, that participate in those markets. Those markets involve derivative transactions, which include certain instruments, such as interest rate swaps, forward contracts, option contracts, financial contracts and other contracts, used in our risk management activities. The Dodd-Frank Act requires that most swaps ultimately will be cleared through a registered clearing facility and that they be traded on a designated exchange or swap execution facility, with certain exceptions for entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. The Dodd-Frank Act requirements relating to derivative transactions have not been fully implemented by the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and the current presidential administration has indicated a desire to repeal and/or replace certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Uncertainty regarding the current law and any new regulations could increase the operational and transactional cost of derivatives contracts and affect the number and/or creditworthiness of available counterparties. In addition, we may transact with counterparties based in the European Union, Canada or other jurisdictions which are in the process of implementing regulations to regulate derivatives transactions, some of which are currently in effect and impose operational and transactional costs on our derivatives activities.\nStockholder Risks\nThere is currently no established public trading market for shares of our Class A common stock and such shares of Class A common stock may never be publicly traded. Accordingly, the holders of our Class A common stock may have no ability to sell their shares.\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy, all units representing limited liability company interests of the Predecessor were canceled and the Reorganized LINN issued shares of Class A common stock. Our Class A common stock is not currently listed on any national or regional securities exchange or quoted on any over-the-counter market. There can be no assurance that a market for our Class A common stock will be established or that, if established, a market will be sustained. Therefore, holders of our Class A common stock may be unable to sell their shares.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, and the level of trading that develops for our Class A common stock may be affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things, our new capital structure as a result of the transactions contemplated by the LINN Plan, our limited trading history subsequent to our emergence from bankruptcy, our limited trading volume, the concentration of holdings of our Class A common stock, the lack of comparable historical financial information, in certain material respects, given the adoption of fresh start accounting, actual or anticipated variations in our operating results and cash flows, the nature and content of our earnings releases, announcements or events that impact our assets, customers, competitors or markets, business conditions in our markets and the general state of the securities markets and the market for energy-related stocks, as well as general economic and market conditions and other factors that may affect our future results, including those described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. No assurance can be given that an active market will develop for our Class A common stock or as to the liquidity of the trading market for our Class A common stock. Our Class A common stock may be traded only infrequently in transactions arranged through brokers or otherwise, and reliable market quotations may not be available. Holders of our Class A common stock may experience difficulty in reselling, or an inability to sell, their shares. In addition, if an active trading market does not develop or is not maintained, significant sales of our Class A common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThere may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant stockholders could be in conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nFunds associated with Fir Tree Inc., York Capital Management Global Advisors, LLC and Elliott Management Corporation collectively owned approximately 49% of our outstanding Class A common stock as of March 13, 2017. Circumstances may arise in which these stockholders may have an interest in pursuing or preventing acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions, including the issuance of additional shares or debt, that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in the Company. Such transactions might adversely affect us or other holders of our Class A common stock. In addition, our significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with significant stockholders.\nThe issuance of share-based awards may dilute your holding of shares of Class A common stock.\nPursuant to the LINN Plan, we issued 91,708,500 shares of Class A common stock in the Reorganized LINN. A total of 6,444,381 shares of Class A common stock of the Reorganized LINN were reserved for issuance (of which 2,478,608 shares were issued as of the Effective Date) under the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (\u201c2017 Incentive Plan\u201d) as equity-based awards to employees, directors and certain other persons. The exercise of equity awards, including any stock options that we may grant in the future, and warrants, and the sale of shares of our common stock underlying any such stock options could have an adverse effect on the market for our common stock, including the price that investors could obtain for their shares. Investors may experience dilution in the value of their investment upon the exercise of any stock options that may be granted or issued pursuant to the 2017 Incentive Plan in the future.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the near future.\nWe do not anticipate that cash dividends or other distributions will be paid with respect to our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, restrictive covenants in certain debt instruments to which we are, or may be, a party, may limit our ability to pay dividends or for us to receive dividends from our operating companies, any of which may negatively impact the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nCertain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our Board of Directors and may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that some stockholders may consider beneficial.\nCertain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our Board of Directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. The provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include, among other things, those that:\n\u2022\nauthorize our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice procedures for nominating directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings; and\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\n\u2022\nlimit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders.\nThese provisions could enable the Board of Directors to delay or prevent a transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders may believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may discourage or prevent attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. These provisions may also discourage or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and, as such, are allowed to provide less disclosure than larger public companies.\nWe are currently a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we have certain decreased disclosure obligations in our SEC filings, which may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects and may result in less investor confidence.", "PERMNO": 18246, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "ROAN"}
