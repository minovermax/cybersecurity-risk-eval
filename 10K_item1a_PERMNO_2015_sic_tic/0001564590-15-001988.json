Risk Factors.\nExcept for the historical information contained herein or incorporated by reference, this Annual Report and the information incorporated by reference contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include projections about our accounting and finances, plans and objectives for the future, future operating and economic performance and other statements regarding future performance. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed here. Factors that could cause or contribute to differences in our actual results include those discussed in the following section, as well as those discussed in Part II, Item 7 entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and elsewhere throughout this Annual Report and in any other documents incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. You should consider carefully the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included or incorporated in this Annual Report. Each of these risk factors, either alone or taken together, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. There may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently believe are immaterial which could also impair our business and financial position.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a limited operating history and have incurred significant losses since our inception, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We have one lead product candidate and no commercial sales, which, together with our limited operating history, makes it difficult to assess our future viability.\nWe are a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. Pharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. To date, we have focused principally on developing our lead product candidate, LIPO-202, an injectable formulation of salmeterol xinafoate for the reduction of central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat in non-obese patients. We are not profitable and have incurred losses in each year since our inception in 2007. We have only a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. In addition, we have limited experience and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the specialty pharmaceutical industry. We have not generated any revenue from product sales to date. We continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. Our net loss for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was approximately $10.8 million and $15.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $69.7million. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, LIPO-202 and assuming we obtain regulatory approval, begin to commercialize LIPO-202. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nWe are substantially dependent on the success of our lead product candidate, LIPO-202.\nTo date, we have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources in the research and development and commercial planning for LIPO-202, which is currently our lead product candidate. In particular, we have completed a Phase 2 RESET clinical trial, or RESET. Our near-term prospects, including our ability to finance our company and generate revenue, as well as our future growth, will depend heavily on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of LIPO-202. The clinical and commercial success of LIPO-202 will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u25cf\nany unexpected results from further analysis beyond the top-line data of our recently completed RESET clinical trial;\n\u25cf\ninitiating and obtaining favorable results from our planned Phase 3 clinical program for LIPO-202, which may be slower or cost more than we currently anticipate;\n\u25cf\nat our July 23, 2014 End-of-Phase 2 meeting, the FDA expressed certain concerns regarding the design of our planned Phase 3 clinical trials, and, even if we believe our Phase 3 clinical trials are successful, there can be no assurance that the FDA will agree that we have satisfactorily addressed these concerns or that the FDA will not raise new issues regarding the design of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nour ability to demonstrate the safety of LIPO-202 to the satisfaction of the FDA and other applicable foreign regulatory bodies;\n\u25cf\nour ability to demonstrate efficacy of LIPO-202 to the satisfaction of the FDA and other applicable foreign regulatory bodies, including our ability to utilize FDA-acceptable endpoint tools for measuring efficacy of LIPO-202 in our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nwhether we are required by the FDA or other applicable foreign regulatory bodies to conduct additional clinical trials to support the approval of LIPO-202;\n\u25cf\nwhether the FDA or other applicable foreign regulatory bodies grants a deferral for submission of some or all pediatric data until after the approval of LIPO-202 or grants full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements;\n\u25cf\nthe acceptance by the FDA of our proposed parameters for regulatory approval, including our proposed indication, endpoints and endpoint measurement tools relating to LIPO-202;\n\u25cf\nwhether we are able to secure a partner or partner(s) for the development and commercialization of LIPO-202 outside of the United States and if so, whether such partners will be required to conduct additional studies for the approval of LIPO-202 in such markets in a timely manner;\n\u25cf\nour success in educating physicians and patients about the benefits, administration and use of LIPO-202;\n\u25cf\nthe incidence, duration and severity of adverse side effects;\n\u25cf\nthe timely receipt of necessary marketing approvals from the FDA and similar regulatory bodies around the world;\n\u25cf\nachieving and maintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to LIPO-202;\n\u25cf\nthe availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of alternative and competing treatments;\n\u25cf\nthe effectiveness of our and our potential partners\u2019 marketing, sales and distribution strategy and operations in the United States and other markets around the world;\n\u25cf\nthe ability of our third-party manufacturers and potential partners to manufacture clinical trial and commercial supplies of LIPO-202 to remain in good standing with regulatory bodies, and to develop, validate and maintain commercially viable manufacturing processes that are compliant with Current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations;\n\u25cf\nour ability to successfully commercialize LIPO-202 in the United States, if approved for marketing;\n\u25cf\nour potential partners\u2019 ability to successfully commercialize LIPO-202 in other markets outside of the United States;\n\u25cf\nour ability to enforce our intellectual property rights in and to LIPO-202;\n\u25cf\nour ability to avoid third-party patent interference, patent infringement claims, and challenges by third parties to our intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf\nacceptance of LIPO-202 as safe and effective by patients and the medical community; and\n\u25cf\na continued acceptable safety profile of LIPO-202 following approval.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will ever be able to generate revenue through the sale of LIPO-202. Any one of these factors or other factors discussed in this document could affect our ability to successfully commercialize LIPO-202, which could impact our ability to earn sufficient revenues to transition from a developmental stage company and continue our business. If we are not successful in obtaining regulatory approval of and commercializing LIPO-202, or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe cannot be certain that LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates will receive regulatory approval, and even with regulatory approval they may never achieve market acceptance or commercial success.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of LIPO-202, and our ability to generate significant revenue related to product sales will depend on the successful development and regulatory approval of LIPO-202. In our End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, the FDA expressed concerns regarding our proposed endpoint tools used to assess efficacy of LIPO-202 and questioned whether a more appropriate physical measure of reduction of central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat could be obtained using other measurement tools, such as 2-D ultrasound. We intend to initiate and complete an additional exploratory evaluation of 2-D ultrasound as a secondary measure of the reduction of central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat in a limited number of clinical sites in our Phase 3 pivotal trials, based upon our End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA. The endpoints from the use of 2-D ultrasound may not be acceptable for regulatory approval and if our alternative endpoint tools are not accepted by the FDA, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for LIPO-202.\nEven if we obtain FDA or other foreign regulatory approvals, LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates may not achieve market acceptance among physicians and patients, and may not be commercially successful. Market acceptance of LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe safety and efficacy of LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nacceptance by physicians and patients of LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates as safe and effective treatments;\n\u25cf\nthe clinical indications for which LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates are approved and whether our desired labeling is approved;\n\u25cf\nproper training and administration of LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates by physicians;\n\u25cf\nthe potential and perceived advantages of LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates over alternative treatments;\n\u25cf\nacceptance by physicians and patients that the duration of effect of LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates are significant and have advantages over alternative treatments;\n\u25cf\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments and willingness to pay for LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates, if approved, on the part of physicians and patients;\n\u25cf\nthe willingness of patients to pay for LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates and other aesthetic treatments in general, relative to other discretionary items, especially during economically challenging times;\n\u25cf\nrelative convenience and ease of administration and the ability of patients to commit to an eight-week treatment period;\n\u25cf\nthe incidence, duration and severity of adverse side effects;\n\u25cf\nthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u25cf\nthe degree to which the approved labeling supports promotional initiatives for commercial success.\nAny failure by our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval to achieve market acceptance or commercial success would adversely affect our results of operations.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical testing is expensive, and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Furthermore, we rely on clinical research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and while we have agreements governing their committed activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance. The costs of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project owing to factors that include but are not limited to the following:\n\u25cf\nper patient trial costs;\n\u25cf\nsalaries and related overhead expenses, including share-based compensation and benefits for personnel in research and development functions;\n\u25cf\nfees paid to third-party professional consultants and service providers;\n\u25cf\ncosts to develop and manufacture preclinical study and clinical trial materials;\n\u25cf\ncosts for laboratory supplies;\n\u25cf\nthe number of patients that participate in the trials;\n\u25cf\nthe number of sites included in the trials;\n\u25cf\nthe number of trials required for approval;\n\u25cf\nthe countries in which the trials are conducted;\n\u25cf\nthe length of time required to enroll eligible patients;\n\u25cf\nthe number of doses that patients receive;\n\u25cf\nthe drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;\n\u25cf\nthe phase of development of the product candidate;\n\u25cf\npotential pediatric data requested by regulatory agencies;\n\u25cf\npotential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies;\n\u25cf\nthe duration of patient follow-up; and\n\u25cf\nthe efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate.\nFailure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. For example, we have in the past terminated early-stage development and clinical programs for other potential product candidates due to a lack of sufficient efficacy or the potential for unacceptable adverse reactions to a particular product candidate, as well as our desire to concentrate our efforts on the development of LIPO-202. The results of preclinical and clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. For example, the positive results generated to date in clinical trials for LIPO-202 do not ensure that later clinical trials will demonstrate similar results. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the specialty pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier studies, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Even if our ongoing or future clinical trials are completed, the results may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nWe may experience delays in our ongoing clinical trials, including the planned Phase 3 development of LIPO-202, and we do not know whether future clinical trials, if any, will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll an adequate number of patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed or aborted for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u25cf\ndelay or failure in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u25cf\ninability to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u25cf\nregulatory objections to commencing a clinical trial or proceeding to the next phase of investigation, including inability to reach agreement with the FDA or non-U.S. regulators regarding the scope, design or implementation of our clinical trials or for other reasons such as safety concerns identified during preclinical development or early stage clinical trials;\n\u25cf\ninability to qualify for exemptions from infringement of intellectual property rights for clinical trial testing of products in countries where we want to conduct clinical trials outside the United States;\n\u25cf\ninability to identify, add and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites;\n\u25cf\nwithdrawal of clinical trial sites from our clinical trials as a result of changing standards of care or the ineligibility of a site to participate in our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty identifying and engaging qualified clinical investigators;\n\u25cf\nfailure to obtain institutional review board, or IRB, approval at each site;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including failure to meet the enrollment criteria for our study and competition from other clinical trial programs;\n\u25cf\ninability to retain patients in clinical trials due to the treatment protocol, personal issues, side effects from the therapy or lack of efficacy;\n\u25cf\nfailure to have clinical sites observe trial protocol or continue to participate in a trial;\n\u25cf\nfailure to address any patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial;\n\u25cf\nfailure to address any conflicts with new or existing laws or regulations;\n\u25cf\nfailure to manufacture sufficient quantities of product candidates or placebos for use in clinical trials; or\n\u25cf\ninability to obtain sufficient funding to commence or finish a clinical trial.\nWe could encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by the Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, for such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may suspend or terminate a clinical trial due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with the requirements of the relevant regulatory filing (including clinical protocol and manufacturing), inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial due to unforeseen costs resulting from enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional trials and studies, increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties or other reasons.\nIf we experience delays in the completion of, or terminate, any clinical trial of our current or future product candidates, if any, the commercial prospects of these product candidates may be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed or not realized at all. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of a clinical trial may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nChanges in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we or any of our partners may be required by appropriate regulatory authorities to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us or any of our partners to resubmit clinical trial protocols to independent review boards for re-examination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. If we or any of our partners experience delays in the completion of, or if we or our partners terminate, clinical trials, the commercial prospects for our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate revenue from sales of our products will be prevented or delayed. In addition, many of the factors that may cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nClinical failure can occur at any stage of clinical development. Because the results of earlier clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, any product candidate we or our current or potential future partners advance through clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive regulatory approval.\nClinical failure can occur at any stage of our clinical development. Clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we or our partners may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical or preclinical testing. In addition, data obtained from tests are susceptible to varying interpretations, and regulators may not interpret our data as favorably as we do, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate the same results or otherwise provide adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a product candidate. Frequently, product candidates that have shown promising results in early clinical trials have subsequently suffered significant setbacks in later clinical trials. In addition, the design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product, or approval of a product for desired indications, and flaws or shortcomings in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. We have limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support regulatory approval for our desired indications, and we have never previously submitted an NDA. Further, clinical trials of potential products often reveal that it is not practical or feasible to continue development efforts. If LIPO-202 is found to be unsafe or lack efficacy, we will not be able to obtain regulatory approval for it and our business would be harmed. For example, if the results of our planned Phase 3 clinical trials of LIPO-202 do not achieve primary or secondary efficacy endpoints or we are unable to provide primary or secondary endpoint measurements deemed acceptable by the FDA or non-U.S. regulators and demonstrate an acceptable safety level, the prospects for approval of LIPO-202 would be materially and adversely affected. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including those with greater resources and experience than us, have suffered significant setbacks in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical trials.\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety and/or efficacy results between different trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including differences in trial protocols and design, the size and type of the patient populations, adherence to the dosing regimen and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. We do not know whether any Phase 2, Phase 3 or other clinical trials we or any partners may conduct will demonstrate consistent and/or adequate efficacy and safety to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates.\nWe may be unable to successfully pursue the 505(b)(2) pathway as planned, which would materially impact our likelihood of obtaining FDA approval.\nA 505(b)(2) application that relies for approval on the FDA\u2019s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for one or more listed drugs must establish that such reliance is scientifically appropriate, and must submit data necessary to support any aspects of the proposed drug product that represent modifications to the listed drug(s). We must establish a bridge between our proposed drug product and each listed drug upon which we propose to rely, to demonstrate that such reliance is scientifically justified. Determining and reaching agreement with the FDA regarding exactly what additional or \u201cbridging\u201d data will be needed to support the proposed modification to the listed drug can present challenges and is a fact-specific determination that must be made on a case-by-case basis.\nIf we are unable to establish to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction that our reliance on the listed drug is scientifically appropriate, and that we have sufficiently addressed the safety and effectiveness implications of our proposed modifications (including, importantly, the different indication), we may be unable to utilize this regulatory pathway.\nLIPO-202, if approved, will face significant competition, and the failure by us to compete effectively may prevent us from achieving significant market acceptance.\nThe aesthetic procedure market is highly competitive and dynamic, and is characterized by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations. We are seeking regulatory approval of LIPO-202 for the reduction of central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat in non-obese patients. A substantial portion of our target physician market is comprised of dermatologists, primary care physicians, OB/GYNs, and members of other specialties, some of whom perform liposuction, non-invasive fat reduction and other procedures for fat reduction. Such physicians may find it more advantageous to utilize these surgical and non-surgical procedures to remove localized fat deposits rather than a cosmetic injectable therapy such as LIPO-202. In addition, we expect that LIPO-202, if approved, will compete for the attention and discretionary income of patients with new and existing therapies for the treatment of localized fat, including liposuction and other procedures, as well as other technologies aimed at fat reduction, including other injections and laser energy-based, cryolipolysis, and ultrasound energy-based products.\nIf approved, LIPO-202 may also compete with unregulated, unapproved and off-label fat reduction and body contouring treatments. For example, we are aware that there are entities such as compounding pharmacies that have manufactured quantities of phosphatidylcholine and deoxycholic acid-based formulations, which are being sold as fat reduction treatments without drug approval from the FDA. In order to compete successfully in the aesthetics market, we will have to demonstrate that the reduction of central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat with LIPO-202 is a worthwhile aesthetic treatment and is a superior alternative to existing therapies. There may be other drug or device products or injectable therapies currently under development or being considered for development for the reduction of central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat of which we are not currently aware, but which upon approval would compete directly with LIPO-202.\nLIPO-202, if approved, will also compete for patient and physician resources and mindshare with products and technologies that are not primarily related to fat reduction and body contouring, such as skin tightening, anti-aging, dispigmentation and other aesthetic technologies. The medical technology and aesthetic companies that offer these products tend to have a broad range of other product offerings, large direct sales forces, and long-term customer relationships with our target physicians, which could inhibit our market penetration efforts.\nIn addition, a large portion of our target physician market is comprised of plastic surgeons who utilize surgical methods for fat reduction. Such physicians may find it more advantageous to utilize surgical techniques to remove localized fat deposits rather than a cosmetic injectable therapy such as LIPO-202. Additionally, some non-invasive technologies for the reduction of fat or \u201cbody contouring\u201d have received marketing clearance from the FDA. For example, in September 2010, Zeltiq Aesthetics, Inc. received clearance for their body contouring system, CoolSculpting, which utilizes controlled cooling to reduce the temperature of fat cells in the treated area for the selective reduction of fat around the flanks. Zerona, a laser energy-based product marketed by Erchonia Corporation, and Liposonix, an ultrasound energy-based product marketed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Inc., have also received FDA marketing clearance. We are also aware that Kythera, Inc. has an injectable drug product in development, ATX-101, which has completed Phase 3 clinical trials in the United States. Kythera submitted an NDA for this product to the FDA in May 2014 for the reduction of submental fullness in the chin and such NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. Like LIPO-202, this product is an injectable drug which requires a series of injections below the chin. If approved, this product may be used off-label by physicians in the abdomen, the expected treatment indication for LIPO-202, which may decrease the market available for LIPO-202 once approved.\nMany of these potential competitors are large, experienced companies that have substantially greater resources and brand recognition than we do. Competing in the aesthetic market could result in price-cutting, reduced profit margins, and limited market share, any of which would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe commercial success of LIPO-202, if approved, will depend significantly on broad physician adoption and use of LIPO-202.\nThe commercial success of LIPO-202, if approved, will depend significantly on the broad adoption and use of LIPO-202 by physicians for fat reduction and body contouring. Physician adoption of LIPO-202 for the reduction of central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat, if approved, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe safety and effectiveness of LIPO-202 for fat reduction and body contouring as compared to alternative treatments or procedures;\n\u25cf\nphysician willingness to adopt a new therapy for fat reduction and body contouring;\n\u25cf\npatient compliance with the treatment regimen;\n\u25cf\novercoming any biases surgeons may have in favor of surgical procedures for the reduction of central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat;\n\u25cf\npatient satisfaction with administration, results and duration of the effects of LIPO-202;\n\u25cf\npatient demand for central abdominal bulge reduction and body contouring;\n\u25cf\nthe revenue and profitability that LIPO-202 will offer a physician as compared to alternative treatments or procedures; and\n\u25cf\nthe difficulty of administering LIPO-202 and any potential side effects of the administration and/or use of LIPO-202.\nIf LIPO-202 is approved for use and physicians do not broadly adopt it for fat reduction and body contouring, our financial performance will be adversely affected.\nWe currently have no sales or marketing organization. If we are unable to establish sales capabilities on our own or through third parties, we may not be able to market and sell LIPO-202 effectively in the United States or any other current and future product candidates, if approved, or generate product revenue.\nWe currently do not have a commercial organization. In order to commercialize LIPO-202 in the United States, we must build our marketing, sales, distribution, management and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so. If LIPO-202 receives regulatory approval, we intend to establish a sales organization with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize our product candidates, which will be expensive, require substantial additional capital and be time consuming. We have no prior experience in the marketing, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products and there are significant risks involved in building and managing a sales organization, including our ability to hire, retain, and incentivize qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel, and effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of these products. We may choose to collaborate with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize LIPO-202. If we are not successful in commercializing LIPO-202 or any of our current or future product candidates, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future product revenue will suffer and we would incur significant additional losses.\nWe will need to increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had ten full-time employees and one part-time employee. We will need to continue to expand our managerial, operational, commercial, medical affairs, finance and other resources in order to manage our operations and clinical trials, continue our development activities and commercialize LIPO-202 or any of our current and future product candidates. Our management and personnel, systems and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. Our need to effectively execute our growth strategy requires that we:\n\u25cf\nmanage our clinical trials effectively;\n\u25cf\nidentify, recruit, retain, incentivize and integrate additional employees;\n\u25cf\nbuild effective business processes to launch LIPO-202 and other products;\n\u25cf\nmanage our internal development efforts effectively while carrying out our contractual obligations to third parties; and\n\u25cf\ncontinue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.\nThe commercial success of LIPO-202 outside of the United States depends significantly on the development and marketing efforts of NovaMedica, LLC and other third parties, and if any of these parties fails to perform as expected, or is unable to obtain the required regulatory approvals for our product candidates, the potential for us to generate future revenue from royalties and milestone payments from LIPO-202 outside the United States would be significantly reduced and our business would be materially and adversely harmed.\nIn December 2012, we entered into a technology transfer agreement with Domain Russia Investments Limited, or DRI, which was subsequently assigned to NovaMedica, LLC, or NovaMedica, pursuant to an assignment and assumption agreement, as contemplated in the technology transfer agreement with DRI. Under this agreement, we are working with NovaMedica to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our product candidates from regulatory bodies in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. NovaMedica is responsible for the commercialization of LIPO-202 and LIPO-102, if regulatory approval is achieved in those territories. We intend to identify a strategic partner or partners to develop and commercialize LIPO-202 for other markets outside these territories and the United States, and we intend to pursue partnering and licensing arrangements for the European, Far Eastern, and Latin American markets.\nThe potential for us to generate revenue from royalties and milestone payments from our product candidates outside of the United States depends primarily on the successful development, regulatory approval, marketing and commercialization of our products by NovaMedica and other strategic partners and third parties.\nAny of the following events or factors could have a material adverse effect on the potential and timing for us to receive regulatory and commercial milestone payments and generate royalties from the sale of LIPO-202 outside of the United States:\n\u25cf\nour partners\u2019 receipt of, or failure to comply with, additional requests and recommendations from relevant foreign regulatory bodies, including any request for additional clinical trials;\n\u25cf\ndifferent requirements for approval by various regulatory bodies outside the United States and our partners\u2019 ability to conduct necessary clinical trials and compile and submit an adequate registration dossier;\n\u25cf\nour partners\u2019 inability to obtain all necessary approvals from regulatory bodies outside the United States;\n\u25cf\nour partners\u2019 failure to commit adequate resources to the development, regulatory approval, marketing, distribution and intellectual property protection of LIPO-202;\n\u25cf\nour ability to build and maintain a global safety database, together with our partners and collaborators, sufficient for regulatory reporting; and\n\u25cf\nany failure of our partners to manufacture our product candidate in compliance with requirements of relevant regulatory bodies and in quantities sufficient to meet clinical or commercial demand.\nWe rely completely on third-party suppliers to manufacture and distribute our clinical drug supplies for LIPO-202, we intend to rely on third parties for commercial manufacturing and distribution of LIPO-202 and we expect to rely on third parties for manufacturing and distribution of preclinical, clinical, and commercial supplies of any of our other current and future product candidates.\nWe do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the infrastructure or capability to manufacture or distribute preclinical, clinical, or commercial quantities of drug substance or drug product, including LIPO-202. Facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture drug substance and drug product for commercial sale must be approved by the FDA or other relevant foreign regulatory bodies pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit our NDA or any relevant foreign regulatory submission to the applicable regulatory agency.\nWe do not have direct control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate manufacturing capacity and capabilities to serve our needs, including quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. We are dependent on our contract manufacturers for compliance with cGMP requirements, for manufacture of drug substance and finished drug products. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and/or the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or foreign regulatory bodies, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. Furthermore, these contract manufacturers are engaged with other companies to supply and/or manufacture materials or products for such companies, which also exposes our manufacturers to regulatory risks for the production of such materials and products. As a result, failure to meet the regulatory requirements for the production of those materials and products may also affect the regulatory clearance of a contract manufacturers\u2019 facility. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory agency does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates, or if it withdraws its approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would negatively impact our ability to develop, and obtain regulatory approval for or market LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates, if approved. Any of these factors could cause a delay of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, approvals or commercialization of our product candidates, entail higher costs or impair our reputation.\nWe and our contract manufacturers continue to characterize and improve manufacturing processes and quality systems. As development and commercialization progresses, we may encounter difficulties with new or existing processes. Depending upon the extent of the challenges encountered, there may be an interruption in clinical and/or commercial supply.\nIn addition, a failure to provide drug substance supply could have an adverse effect in supply of finished drug product for clinical trials and/or finished drug product in our commercial territories, and, as a result, may have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe expect to continue to depend on third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers for the foreseeable future. We currently source salmeterol xinafoate, the active drug ingredient of LIPO-202, from Natco Pharma Limited. Lyophilization Services of New England, Inc. manufactures LIPO-202. Testing and stability services for LIPO-202 are currently provided by Pharmaceutical Product Development, LLC, or PPD. We have not yet entered into long-term agreements with any of the aforementioned third-party providers. We currently do not have alternative drug substance and drug product manufacturers; although through extensive diligence several providers have been identified. To manufacture and distribute LIPO-202 in the quantities that we believe will be required to meet anticipated market demand, our third-party manufacturers may need to increase capacity, which could involve significant challenges and will require additional regulatory approvals. In addition, the development of commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities may require us and our third-party manufacturers to invest substantial additional funds and hire and retain the technical personnel who have the necessary manufacturing and quality experience. Neither we nor our third-party manufacturers may successfully complete any required increase to existing manufacturing capacity in a timely manner, or at all.\nWhen completed, our supply agreements cannot guarantee that a contract manufacturer or supplier will provide services adequate for our needs. If a contract manufacturer/supplier becomes financially distressed or insolvent, or discontinues manufacturing supply for us beyond the term of the existing agreement, if any, or for any other reason, this could result in substantial management time and expense to identify and qualify alternative manufacturers or suppliers, and could lead to an interruption in clinical or commercial supply.\nIf there is a disruption to our or our third-party manufacturers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 relevant operations, we will have no other means of producing LIPO-202 until the affected facilities are restored or we or they procure and qualify alternative facilities. Additionally, any damage to or destruction of our or our third-party manufacturers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 facilities or equipment may significantly impair our ability to manufacture LIPO-202 on a timely basis.\nOur reliance on contract manufacturers further exposes us to the possibility that they, or third parties with access to their facilities, will have access to and may misappropriate our trade secrets or other proprietary information.\nWe currently rely on the services of a few testing organizations. Failure of these vendors to perform adequately can materially and adversely affect our business.\nThere are a limited number of providers for testing of LIPO-202, and we do not have direct control over our testing labs. Nor do we have direct control over the processes or timing for the acquisition of the raw materials and components necessary to test our product candidate. If these raw materials and/or components are not available at the volumes and quantity levels required, it could have a material and adverse impact on the supply of drug substance and finished drug product. We work closely with our testing labs to enable timely delivery of required drug substance and drug product, but these efforts may be insufficient which may lead to delays in testing of drug product. Although we generally do not begin a clinical trial unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of a drug product to complete the study, a delay in the supply of sufficient drug product could delay completion of clinical trials and the clinical program, regulatory approval, and generation of revenue.\nTesting and stability services for LIPO-202 are currently provided by PPD. We have not yet entered into long-term agreements with PPD.\nManufacturing and supply of drug substance and finished drug product is a complex and technically challenging undertaking, and there is potential for failure at many points in the manufacturing, testing, quality assurance and distribution supply chain, as well as the potential for latent defects after product has been manufactured and distributed.\nManufacturing and supply of drug substance and finished drug product is technically challenging. Changes that may be made outside the purview of our direct control can have an impact on the success of our processes, on quality, and successful delivery of product to physicians. Mistakes and mishandling are not uncommon and can affect successful production and supply. Some of these risks include:\n\u25cf\nfailure of our manufacturers to follow cGMP requirements, equipment failures or mishandling of our product while in production or in preparation for transit;\n\u25cf\ntransportation and import/export risk;\n\u25cf\ndelays in analytical results or failure of sensitive analytical techniques that we will depend upon for quality control, release of product, and shelf life determination;\n\u25cf\nnatural disasters, labor disputes, financial distress, lack of raw material and component supply, issues with facilities and equipment or other forms of disruption to business operations at our contract manufacturers/suppliers; and\n\u25cf\nlatent defects that may become apparent after product has been released and that may result in recall and destruction of drug.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct all our preclinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize LIPO-202.\nWe do not have the ability to conduct preclinical studies or clinical trials independently. We rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories, collaborative partners and other third parties, such as CROs, to conduct clinical trials on our product candidates. The third parties with whom we contract for execution of our clinical trials play a significant role in the conduct of these trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. However, these third parties are not our employees, and except for contractual duties and obligations, we have limited ability to control the amount, quality or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. Although we rely on these third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with regulations and standards referred to as current Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, for conducting preclinical studies, and Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate, and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials.\nIn addition, the execution of preclinical studies and clinical trials, and the subsequent compilation and analysis of the data produced, requires coordination among various parties. In order for these functions to be carried out effectively and efficiently, it is imperative that these parties communicate and coordinate with one another. Moreover, these third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. These third parties may terminate their agreements with us upon as little as 30 days prior written notice of a material breach by us that is not cured within 30 days. Many of these agreements may also be terminated by such third parties under certain other circumstances, including our insolvency or our failure to comply with applicable laws. In general, these agreements require such third parties to reasonably cooperate with us at our expense for an orderly winding down of services of such third parties under the agreements. If the third parties conducting our clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or obligations, experience work stoppages, become insolvent or undergo restructuring, do not meet expected deadlines, terminate their agreements with us or need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical trial protocols or GCPs, or for any other reason, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties, which could be difficult, costly or impossible, and our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated or may need to be repeated. If any of the foregoing were to occur, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize the product candidate being tested in such trials in a timely fashion, or at all.\nOur existing collaboration with NovaMedica is important to our business, and future collaborations may also be important to us. If we are unable to maintain any of these collaborations, or if these collaborations are not successful, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have entered into a collaboration with NovaMedica for the development and commercialization of our product candidates in Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. Our existing collaboration, and any future collaborations we enter into, may pose a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to the development and commercialization of product candidates under these collaborations;\n\u25cf\ncollaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u25cf\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of any product candidates that achieve regulatory approval, or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u25cf\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u25cf\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with the products or product candidates that are the subject of our collaboration agreements with them, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of the product candidates that are covered under our collaboration with them;\n\u25cf\na collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more product candidates that are subject to a collaboration agreement with us and achieves regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n\u25cf\ndisagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u25cf\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to result in litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property rights or proprietary information;\n\u25cf\ncollaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u25cf\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, in certain instances, we would potentially lose the right to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates;\n\u25cf\ncollaborators may learn about our technology and use this knowledge to compete with us;\n\u25cf\nnegative results in preclinical or clinical trials conducted by our collaborators could produce results that harm or impair other products using our technology;\n\u25cf\nthere may be conflicts between collaborators that could negatively affect those collaborations or others; and\n\u25cf\nthe number and type of our collaborations could adversely affect our attractiveness to future collaborators or acquirers.\nAll of the risks relating to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization described in this document also apply to the activities of our collaborators and there can be no assurance that our collaborations will produce positive results or successful products on a timely basis or at all. Additionally, subject to its contractual obligations to us, if a collaborator of ours is involved in a business combination or otherwise changes its business priorities, the collaborator might deemphasize or terminate the development or commercialization of any product candidate licensed to it by us. If one or more of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators and our perception in the business and financial communities, as well as our stock price, could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to market LIPO-202 in the United States, if approved, will be limited to an indication approved by the FDA, and if we want to expand the indications for which we may market LIPO-202, we will need to conduct additional clinical trials and obtain additional regulatory approvals, which may not be granted.\nWe intend to seek regulatory approval of LIPO-202 in the United States for the reduction of central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat in non-obese patients. The FDA has not confirmed that our proposed indication is a recognized disease or condition or that it is an acceptable indication for regulatory approval. We may be forced to change our indication for LIPO-202 in order to obtain approval for LIPO-202, which could adversely impact our ability to market LIPO-202. Moreover, even if LIPO-202 is approved for our proposed indication, the FDA likely will prohibit our marketing or advertising of LIPO-202 for use in other specific body areas, which could limit physician and patient adoption. We may attempt to develop, seek regulatory approval for, promote and commercialize new treatment indications and protocols for LIPO-202 in the future, but we cannot predict when or if we will receive the approvals required to do so. In addition, we likely would be required to conduct additional clinical trials or studies to support our applications, which would be time-consuming and expensive, and may produce results that do not result in regulatory approvals. If we do not obtain additional regulatory approvals, our ability to expand our business in the United States and elsewhere will be limited.\nEven if LIPO-202 is approved for commercialization, if there is not sufficient patient demand for procedures using LIPO-202, our financial results and future prospects will be harmed.\nThe reduction of central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat with LIPO-202 is an elective procedure, the cost of which must be borne by the patient, and we do not expect it to be reimbursable through government or private health insurance. The decision by a patient to elect to undergo treatment with LIPO-202 may be influenced by a number of factors, such as:\n\u25cf\nthe success of any sales and marketing programs that we, our collaborators, or any third parties we or they engage, undertake, and as to which we have limited experience;\n\u25cf\nthe extent to which physicians adopt and recommend LIPO-202 to their patients;\n\u25cf\nthe extent to which LIPO-202 satisfies patient expectations;\n\u25cf\nthe ability of physicians and clinicians to properly follow instructions in administering the subcutaneous injections across the central abdominal treatment area such that their patients do not experience excessive discomfort during treatment or adverse side effects;\n\u25cf\nthe cost, safety and effectiveness of LIPO-202 versus other aesthetic treatments;\n\u25cf\nconsumer sentiment about the benefits and risks of aesthetic procedures generally and LIPO-202 in particular;\n\u25cf\nthe success of any direct-to-consumer marketing efforts we may initiate; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral consumer confidence, which may be impacted by economic and political conditions.\nOur financial performance will be materially harmed if we cannot generate significant patient demand for LIPO-202.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any products. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability, and a breach of warranties, among others. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf\ndecreased demand for LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates;\n\u25cf\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u25cf\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u25cf\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u25cf\nregulatory investigations, product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u25cf\nloss of revenue; and\n\u25cf\nthe inability to commercialize LIPO-202 or any our other current or future product candidates.\nOur inability to obtain and maintain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost and scope of coverage to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of LIPO-202 or any of our other products we develop. We currently carry product liability insurance covering our clinical trials in the amount of $5.0 million in the aggregate. Although we maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions and deductibles, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We will have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts. Moreover, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses. If and when we obtain approval for marketing LIPO-202, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of LIPO-202; however, we may be unable to obtain this liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms.\nIf we fail to attract and keep senior management and key scientific and commercial personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates, conduct our clinical trials and commercialize LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, clinical and scientific, and commercial personnel. We are highly dependent upon our senior management, particularly our President and Chief Executive Officer. We have not entered into any employment agreements with our key personnel other than our senior management team, nor do we maintain key man life insurance on the lives of any of the members of our senior management. Although we have a stock option plan pursuant to which we provide our executive officers with various economic incentives to remain employed with us, these incentives may not be sufficient to retain them. None of our senior management has any arrangement with us for a fixed term of service. The loss of services of any of these individuals or our inability to hire, retain and motivate additional qualified personnel in the future could delay or prevent the successful development of our product pipeline, completion of our planned clinical trials or the commercialization of LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates.\nAlthough we have not historically experienced unique difficulties attracting and retaining qualified employees, we could experience such problems in the future. For example, competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology and specialty pharmaceuticals field is intense due to the limited number of individuals who possess the skills and experience required by our industry. We will need to hire additional personnel as we expand our clinical development and commercial activities. We may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their research output.\nIf we are not successful in discovering, developing and commercializing additional product candidates, our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives would be impaired.\nAlthough a substantial amount of our effort will focus on the continued clinical testing and potential approval of LIPO-202, an element of our strategy is to discover, develop and commercialize a portfolio of products to serve the aesthetic market. We are seeking to do so through our internal research programs and may explore strategic collaborations for the development or acquisition of new products. Our other potential product candidate, LIPO-102, remains in the discovery stage. Research programs to identify product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources, whether or not any product candidates are ultimately identified. Our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for many reasons, including the following:\n\u25cf\nthe research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential product candidates;\n\u25cf\ncompetitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete or less attractive;\n\u25cf\nproduct candidates we develop may nevertheless be covered by third parties\u2019 patents or other exclusive rights;\n\u25cf\na product candidate may on further study be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective or otherwise does not meet applicable regulatory criteria;\n\u25cf\na product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all;\n\u25cf\na product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community or third-party payors, if applicable; and\n\u25cf\nthe FDA or other regulatory authorities may not approve or agree with the intended use of a new product candidate.\nIf we fail to develop and successfully commercialize other current and future product candidates, our business and future prospects may be harmed and our business will be more vulnerable to any problems that we encounter in developing and commercializing LIPO-202.\nRequirements associated with being a public company will increase our costs significantly, as well as divert significant company resources and management attention.\nWe will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses as a public company, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, and regulations regarding corporate governance practices. The listing requirements of The NASDAQ Global Market require that we satisfy certain corporate governance requirements relating to director independence, distributing annual and interim reports, stockholder meetings, approvals and voting, soliciting proxies, conflicts of interest and a code of conduct. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these requirements. Moreover, the reporting requirements, rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. Any changes we make to comply with these obligations may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely basis, or at all. These reporting requirements, rules and regulations, coupled with the increase in potential litigation exposure associated with being a public company, could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or board committees or to serve as executive officers, or to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, on acceptable terms.\nAfter the completion of our IPO, in November 2014, we became subject to Section 404 of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, and the related rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, which generally require our management and an independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Beginning with the second annual report that we will be required to file with the SEC, Section 404 requires an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for so long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404. Once we are no longer an emerging growth company or, if prior to such date, we opt to no longer take advantage of the applicable exemption, we will be required to include an opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, (3) the day we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as measured as of each June 30th, and (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nTo date, we have never conducted a review of our internal control for the purpose of providing the reports required by these rules. During the course of our review and testing, we may identify deficiencies and be unable to remediate them before we must provide the required reports. Furthermore, if we have a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. We or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, which could harm our operating results, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and cause the trading price of our stock to fall.\nIn addition, as a public company we will be required to file accurate and timely quarterly and annual reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act, as amended. In order to report our results of operations and financial statements on an accurate and timely basis, we will depend on CROs to provide timely and accurate notice of their costs to us and, if LIPO- 202 is approved by relevant foreign regulatory authorities and sold by NovaMedica, we would depend on NovaMedica to provide timely and accurate reports on royalties payable to us. Any failure to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis could result in sanctions, lawsuits, delisting of our shares from The NASDAQ Global Market or other adverse consequences that would materially harm our business. In addition, being a public company could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nIf we fail to comply with the covenants and other obligations under our credit facility, the lenders may be able to accelerate amounts owed under the facilities and may foreclose upon the assets securing our obligations.\nIn June 2014, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc., or Hercules. As of December 31, 2014, $10.0 million remained outstanding under the loan. Borrowings under our loan agreement are secured by all of our tangible assets. The covenants set forth in the loan and security agreement require, among other things, that we seek consent from Hercules prior to certain corporate changes and provide certain unaudited financial information within 30 days after the end of each month. If we fail to comply with the covenants and our other obligations under the credit facility, Hercules would be able to accelerate the required repayment of amounts due under the loan agreement and, if they are not repaid, could foreclose upon our assets securing our obligations under the credit facility.\nUnfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. Furthermore, the market for aesthetic medical procedures may be particularly vulnerable to unfavorable economic conditions. In particular, we do not expect LIPO-202 to be reimbursed by any government or third-party payor and, as a result, demand for this product will be tied to discretionary spending levels of our targeted patient population. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, such as the most recent global financial crisis, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including, weakened demand for LIPO-202, if approved, and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. This is particularly true in Europe, which is undergoing a continued severe economic crisis. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our customers to delay making payments for our services. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur research and development activities and our third-party manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials owned by us, including the components of our product candidates and other hazardous compounds. We and our manufacturers and suppliers are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our and our manufacturers\u2019 facilities pending their use and disposal. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. We do not currently carry biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage.\nWe or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by earthquakes, wildfires or other natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nOur corporate headquarters and other facilities are located in the San Diego area, which in the past has experienced both severe earthquakes and wildfires. We do not carry earthquake insurance. Earthquakes, wildfires or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIf a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as our enterprise financial systems or manufacturing resource planning and enterprise quality systems, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, particularly when taken together with our lack of insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurthermore, integral parties in our supply chain are geographically concentrated and operating from single sites, increasing their vulnerability to natural disasters or other sudden, unforeseen and severe adverse events. If such an event were to affect our supply chain, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties to manufacture LIPO-202 and conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our product candidate could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe will require substantial additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development, other operations or commercialization efforts.\nSince our inception, substantially all of our resources have been dedicated to the preclinical and clinical development of our lead product candidate, LIPO-202. As of December 31, 2014, we had working capital of $75.0 million and capital resources consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $75.9 million. We have drawn down $10.0 million under our credit facility. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future on the completion of clinical development and regulatory preparedness of LIPO-202, preparing and filing the NDA filing, preparations for a commercial launch of LIPO-202, if approved, and development of any other current or future product candidates we may choose to further develop pursue. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and manufacturing and supply as well as marketing and selling any products approved for sale. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. Because the outcome of any drug development process is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of LIPO-202 or any other current or future product candidates.\nIn November 2014, we received net proceeds of approximately $57.7 million from our IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering-related transaction costs. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next twelve months. In particular, we expect that the net proceeds from our IPO will be sufficient to fund our U.S. Phase 3 clinical trials of LIPO-202. However, our operating plan may change as a result of factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as strategic collaborations. Such financing may result in dilution to stockholders, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may adversely affect our business. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nany unexpected results from further analysis beyond top-line data of our recently completed RESET clinical trial for LIPO-202;\n\u25cf\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates, and conducting preclinical and clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nthe cost of commercialization activities if LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs and preparedness of our corporate infrastructure;\n\u25cf\nthe cost of manufacturing LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates that we obtain approval for and successfully commercialize;\n\u25cf\nour ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;\n\u25cf\nwhether NovaMedica continues to pursue or terminate our technology transfer agreement with NovaMedica for the development and commercialization of LIPO-202 in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States;\n\u25cf\nthe number and characteristics of any additional product candidates we may develop or acquire;\n\u25cf\nany product liability or other lawsuits related to our products or commenced against us;\n\u25cf\nthe expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel;\n\u25cf\nthe costs associated with being a public company;\n\u25cf\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; and\n\u25cf\nthe timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, any future approved products, if any.\nAdditional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to:\n\u25cf\ndelay, limit, reduce or terminate preclinical studies, clinical trials or other development activities for LIPO-202 or any of our other current or future product candidates;\n\u25cf\ndelay, limit, reduce or terminate our research and development activities; or\n\u25cf\ndelay, limit, reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize LIPO-202 or any of our other current or future product candidates.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nWe may seek additional capital through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could involve certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidate, or grant licenses on terms unfavorable to us.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had U.S. federal and California net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately $64.9 million and state NOLs of approximately $64.1 million, which expire in various years beginning in 2017 if not utilized. Under Sections 382 and 383 of Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its future post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5% shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We believe we have experienced certain ownership changes in the past and have reduced our deferred tax assets related to NOLs accordingly. In the event that it is determined that we have in the past experienced additional ownership changes, or if we experience one or more ownership changes as a result of future transactions in our stock, then we may be further limited in our ability to use our NOLs and other tax assets to reduce taxes owed on the net taxable income that we earn in the event that we attain profitability. Any such limitations on the ability to use our NOLs and other tax assets could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results in the event that we attain profitability.\nUnstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and stock price.\nAs widely reported, global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme disruptions in the past several years, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic stability. There can be no assurance that further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn, volatile business environment or continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. If the current equity and credit markets deteriorate, or do not improve, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly, and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon clinical development plans. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our current service providers, manufacturers and other partners may not survive these difficult economic times, which could directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had approximately $75.9 million of cash and cash equivalents. While we are not aware of any material losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents since December 31, 2014, no assurance can be given that further deterioration of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents or our ability to meet our financing objectives. Furthermore, our stock price may decline due in part to the volatility of the stock market and the general economic downturn.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf our efforts to protect the intellectual property related to our product candidates are not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our product candidates and technology.\nThe patent application process, also known as patent prosecution, is expensive and time-consuming, and we and any future licensors and licensees may not be able to prepare, file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we or our current licensors, or any future licensors or licensees, will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Therefore, these and any of our patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. It is possible that defects of form in the preparation or filing of our patents or patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, for example with respect to proper priority claims, inventorship, etc., although we are unaware of any such defects that we believe are of material import. If we or any future licensors or licensees, fail to establish, maintain or protect such patents and other intellectual property rights, such rights may be reduced or eliminated. If our current licensors, or any future licensors or licensees, are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised. If there are material defects in the form or preparation of our patents or patent applications, such patents or applications may be invalid and unenforceable. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe strength of patents in the specialty pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. This uncertainty includes changes to the patent laws through either legislative action to change statutory patent law or court action that may reinterpret existing law in ways affecting the scope or validity of issued patents. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our product candidates in the United States or foreign countries with claims that cover our product candidates. Even if patents do successfully issue from the patent applications that we own or in-license, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of such patents, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. For example, patents granted by the European Patent Office may be challenged, also known as opposed, by any person within nine months from the publication of their grant. Any successful challenge to our patents could deprive us of exclusive rights necessary for the successful commercialization of our product candidates. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our product candidates, or prevent others from designing around our claims. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents we hold or pursue with respect to our product candidates is challenged, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop, or threaten our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\nIn September 2014, a law firm representing one or more unidentified third parties filed with the USPTO two separate Requests for Ex Parte Reexamination against two of our issued US patents: one against each claim of our U.S. Pat. No. 8,420,625, or the \u2019625 patent, and one against each claim of our U.S. Pat. No. 8,404,750, or the \u2019750 patent. The reexamination process is provided for by law and requires the USPTO to consider the scope and validity of issued patents if requested. On October 7, 2014, the USPTO granted the request for reexamination of the \u2019625 patent. On November 19, 2014, the USPTO granted the request for reexamination of the \u2019750 patent. We have not yet received an office action with respect to either the \u2019625 or \u2019750 patent reexaminations. On March 13, 2015, the USPTO issued a communication rejecting each claim of the \u2019625 patent on the basis that the claims are allegedly obvious in view of prior art. We believe that we have meritorious positions to uphold the patentability of each claim of the \u2019625 patent and the \u2019750 patent during any ensuing prosecution before the USPTO. The company is currently preparing its response to the USPTO communication with respect to the \u2019625 patent.\nAll of the claims of a patent remain valid and in force during any reexamination proceeding and we intend to vigorously defend our patent rights during all such proceedings. We cannot predict whether we will ultimately succeed in maintaining the scope and validity of the claims of the \u2019625 patent, and of the \u2019750 patent during either reexamination proceeding. If any of the patent claims in the \u2019625 or the \u2019750 patents are ultimately invalidated or narrowed during prosecution before the USPTO, the extent of the patent coverage afforded to LIPO-202 could be impaired or eliminated, which may harm our ability to prevent others from copying our technology.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after the first non-provisional filing in the patent family, subject to any applicable terminal disclaimer, patent term adjustment and/or patent term extension. Various extensions may be available; however the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Without patent protection for our product candidates, we may be open to competition from generic or follow-on versions of our product candidates. Further, if we encounter delays in our development efforts, including our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market our product candidates under patent protection would be reduced.\nThe majority of our patents and patent applications are entitled to effective filing dates prior to March 16, 2013. For U.S. patent applications in which patent claims are entitled to a priority date before March 16, 2013, an interference proceeding can be provoked by a third-party, for example a competitor, or instituted by the USPTO, to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by those patent claims. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our participation in an interference proceeding may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we also rely on trade secret protection to protect proprietary know-how that may not be patentable or that we elect not to patent, processes for which patents may be difficult to obtain or enforce, and any other elements of our product candidates, and our product development processes (such as a manufacturing and formulation technologies) that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, trade secrets can be difficult to protect if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating any trade secrets. Misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets could significantly affect our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Monitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to prevent such disclosure are, or will be, adequate. Furthermore, trade secret protection does not prevent competitors from independently developing substantially equivalent information and techniques and we cannot guarantee that our competitors will not independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. The FDA, as part of its Transparency Initiative, is currently considering whether to make additional information publicly available on a routine basis, including information that we may consider to be trade secrets or other proprietary information, and it is not clear at the present time how the FDA\u2019s disclosure policies may change in the future, if at all. Further, if we were to enforce a claim that a third-party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, it would be expensive and time consuming, and the outcome would be unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets.\nMoreover, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the non-patented intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, and there is no guarantee that we will have any such enforceable trade secret protection, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn an effort to protect our trade secrets and other confidential information, we require our employees, consultants, advisors, and any other third parties that have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology, for example, third parties involved in the formulation and manufacture of our product candidates, and third parties involved in our clinical trials to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. However, we cannot be certain that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed despite having such confidentiality agreements. Adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets. In addition, in some situations, these confidentiality agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants, or advisors have previous employment or consulting relationships. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use any intellectual property owned by third parties in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in any related or resulting know-how and inventions. If we are unable to prevent unauthorized material disclosure of our trade secrets to third parties, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates.\nAs is the case with other specialty pharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly on obtaining and enforcing patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the specialty pharmaceutical industry involves both technological and legal complexity, and therefore, is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Further, several recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have either narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained.\nFor our U.S. patent applications containing a claim not entitled to priority before March 16, 2013, there is a potential for a greater level of uncertainty in the patent law. In September 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the American Invents Act, or AIA, was signed into law. The AIA includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted, reviewed after issuance, and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO has developed regulations and procedures to govern administration of the AIA, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the AIA. It is not clear what other, if any, impact the AIA will have on the operation of our business. Moreover, the AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. An important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a \u201cfirst-inventor-to-file\u201d system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after that date but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application. Furthermore, our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents depends on whether the differences between our technology and the prior art allow our technology to be patentable over the prior art. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to either (a) file any patent application related to our product candidates or (b) invent any of the inventions claimed in our patents or patent applications.\nAmong some of the other changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit for certain types of cases and providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO for certain grounds of unpatentability. This applies to all of our U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal court necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid as unpatentable even though the same evidence may be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, documentary, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent prosecution process. Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on any issued patent and/or pending patent applications are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of a patent or patent application. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we employ an outside firm and rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees. While an inadvertent lapse may sometimes be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are many situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications directed to our product candidates, our competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than should otherwise have been the case, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. For example, unlike other countries, China has a heightened requirement for patentability, and specifically requires a detailed description of medical uses of a claimed drug. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. Various countries limit the subject matter that can be patented and limit the ability of a patent owner to enforce patents in the medical and other related fields. This may limit our ability to obtain or utilize those patents internationally. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement on infringing activities is inadequate. These products may compete with our products, if approved, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to pharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. In addition, certain countries in Europe and certain developing countries, including India and China, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we may have limited remedies if our patents are infringed or if we are compelled to grant a license to our patents to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we own or license. Finally, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in foreign intellectual property laws.\nThird-party claims alleging intellectual property infringement may adversely affect our business.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties, for example, the intellectual property rights of competitors. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, reexaminations, oppositions and inter partes review proceedings before the USPTO and corresponding foreign patent offices. Our research, development and commercialization activities may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate patents owned or controlled by third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing our product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our activities related to our product candidates may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others. Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents of which we are currently unaware with claims to materials, formulations or methods of manufacture related to the use or manufacture of LIPO-202, LIPO-102 and other future product candidates. We cannot assure you that our product candidates will not infringe existing or future patents. We may not be aware of patents that have already issued that a third party, for example a competitor in the cosmetic market, might assert are infringed by our product candidates. It is also possible that patents of which we are aware, but which we do not believe are relevant to our product candidates, could nevertheless be found to be infringed by our product candidates. Nevertheless, we are not aware of any issued patents that we believe would prevent us from marketing our product candidates, if approved. Because patent applications can take many years to issue and may be confidential for eighteen months or more after filing, there may be currently pending third-party patent applications that have been filed but not published that result in issued patents that LIPO-202, LIPO-102, our future product candidates or our technologies may infringe, or which such third parties claim are infringed by the use of our technologies. These third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages, or the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to develop, manufacture or commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire.\nThird parties making claims against us for infringement or misappropriation of their intellectual property rights may seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us by a third party, we may have to (a) pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed the third party\u2019s patents; (b) obtain one or more licenses from the third party; (c) pay royalties to the third party; and/or (d) redesign any infringing products or acquire or in-license third-party intellectual property rights. Redesigning any infringing products may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. Further, we cannot predict whether any required license would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. In the event that we could not obtain a license, we may be unable to further develop and commercialize our product candidates, which could harm our business significantly, or we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license replacement technology. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms.\nThe licensing and acquisition of third-party proprietary rights is a competitive area, and companies, which may be more established, or have greater resources than we do, may also be pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party proprietary rights that we may consider necessary or attractive in order to commercialize LIPO-202, LIPO-102 and future product candidates. More established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. Further, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us, either on reasonable terms, or at all. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment, or at all. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing LIPO-202 and our other current and future product candidates, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms.\nDefending ourselves or our licensors in litigation is very expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of litigation or administrative proceedings more effectively than we can because of greater financial resources. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive and time consuming, and may not ultimately be successful.\nThird parties may infringe misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights, including our existing patents, patents that may issue to us in the future, or the patents of our licensors to which we have a license. As a result, we may be required to file infringement claims to stop third-party infringement or unauthorized use. Further, we may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.\nGeneric drug manufacturers may develop, seek approval for, and launch generic versions of our products, if approved. If we file an infringement action against such a generic drug manufacturer, that company may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of our or our licensors\u2019 patents, requiring us and/or our licensors to engage in complex, lengthy and costly litigation or other proceedings.\nFor example, if we or one of our future licensors initiated legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidates is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace, and there are numerous grounds upon which a third party can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, inter partes review, post grant review, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, such as opposition proceedings.\nIn addition, within and outside of the United States, there has been a substantial amount of litigation and administrative proceedings, including interference and reexamination proceedings before the USPTO or oppositions and other comparable proceedings in various foreign jurisdictions, regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical industry. Recently, the AIA introduced new procedures including inter partes review and post grant review. The implementation of these procedures brings uncertainty to the possibility of challenges to our patents in the future, including those that patents perceived by our competitors as blocking entry into the market for their products, and the outcome of such challenges.\nSuch litigation and administrative proceedings could result in revocation of our patents or amendment of our patents such that they do not cover our product candidates. They may also put our pending patent applications at risk of not issuing, or issuing with limited and potentially inadequate scope to cover our product candidates. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. Additionally, it is also possible that prior art of which we are aware, but which we do not believe affects the validity or enforceability of a claim, may, nonetheless, ultimately be found by a court of law or an administration panel to affect the validity or enforceability of a claim. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nEnforcing our or any of future licensor\u2019s intellectual property rights through litigation is very expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of litigation more effectively than we can because of greater financial resources. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure. In addition, during the course of litigation or administrative proceedings, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments or public access to related documents. If investors perceive these results to be negative, the market price for our common stock could be significantly harmed.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe have received confidential and proprietary information from third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise improperly used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers. Further, we may be subject to ownership disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. We may also be subject to claims that former employees, consultants, independent contractors, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging our right to and use of confidential and proprietary information. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose our rights therein. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees.\nBecause of the expense and uncertainty of litigation, we may not be in a position to enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties.\nBecause of the expense and uncertainty of litigation, we may conclude that even if a third party is infringing our patents or other intellectual property rights, the risk-adjusted cost of bringing and enforcing such a claim or action may be too high or not in the best interest of our company or our shareholders. In such cases, we may decide that the more prudent course of action is to simply monitor the situation or initiate or seek some other non-litigious action or solution.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe may also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. We may be subject to ownership disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nOur business and product candidates are subject to extensive government regulation.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, import, export, marketing and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, which regulations differ from country to country. We are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving regulation by federal and state governmental authorities in the United States, principally by the Department of Health and Human Services, including the FDA and similar state and foreign regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, including those promulgated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions or other actions, including:\n\u25cf\nwarning letters;\n\u25cf\ncivil and criminal penalties;\n\u25cf\ninjunctions;\n\u25cf\nwithdrawal of product approvals;\n\u25cf\nproduct seizure or detention;\n\u25cf\nproduct recalls;\n\u25cf\nsanctions and fines;\n\u25cf\ntotal or partial suspension of production;\n\u25cf\nrefusal to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs;\n\u25cf\nFalse Claims Act liability; and\n\u25cf\nexclusion from participation in government healthcare programs.\nIn the event that our product candidates receive regulatory approval or clearance, we, and our contract manufacturers and active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, suppliers will remain subject to the periodic cGMP inspection of their plants and facilities, to confirm that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations and consistently producing product that meets the criteria set forth in our NDA. Adverse findings during regulatory inspections may result in a variety of enforcement actions which may be escalated if we, our contract manufacturers, or API suppliers do not adequately respond to the FDA and promptly correct the issue.\nIn addition, once an approval is granted, we are subject to ongoing obligations to collect and report to the FDA safety information and evaluate emerging trends that may impact the benefit-risk balance for a product. The FDA may suspend or withdraw a product\u2019s approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements (by us or by our contract manufacturers or API suppliers), also may result in revisions to the approved labeling, including to add new safety information; imposition of post-market study or clinical trial requirements to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, program.\nFurther, the advertising and promotion of approved drug products are extensively and closely regulated, as are non-promotional communications with medical and scientific professionals. An area of particular attention is promotion of an approved drug product for uses beyond the approved indication(s), known as \u201coff-label\u201d promotion. Failure to comply with such regulations can lead to a variety of enforcement actions, including warning letters, injunctions, and product seizures. Violations of the prohibition of off-label promotion have been alleged to cause violations of the False Claims Act, and have led to government investigations that resulted in civil and criminal settlements in which drug companies have paid billions of dollars in penalties and fines and agreed to significant affirmative compliance obligations in the form of Corporate Integrity Agreements. Accordingly, if any of our product candidates is approved and commercialized, careful attention will need to be given to compliance with the relevant regulatory requirements and restrictions, which are subject to agency interpretation and discretion.\nThe regulatory approval process is highly uncertain and we may not obtain regulatory approval for the commercialization of LIPO-202 or any of our current and future product candidates.\nWe are not permitted to market LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA. To gain approval to market a drug product like LIPO-202, we must provide the FDA and any applicable foreign regulatory authorities with, among other things, data from well controlled clinical trials that adequately demonstrate the safety, efficacy and compliant manufacturing of the product candidate for the intended indication applied for in the NDA or other respective regulatory filing. We have not submitted an application or obtained marketing approval for LIPO-202 anywhere in the world. Obtaining regulatory approval of an NDA can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. Furthermore, we rely upon NovaMedica to help obtain regulatory approval for LIPO-202 in certain territories outside the United States, and we cannot guarantee that they will be successful in doing so.\nPrior to obtaining approval to commercialize a product candidate in the United States or abroad, we or our collaborators must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA or other foreign regulatory bodies, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. Regulatory approval of an NDA or NDA supplement, or foreign equivalents, is not guaranteed, and the approval process is expensive and may take several years. The FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities also have substantial discretion in the approval process. Despite the time and expense exerted, failure can occur at any stage, and we or our collaborators could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials, or perform additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials and manufacturing, even after promising results in earlier preclinical studies or clinical trials. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, preclinical findings made while clinical trials were underway and safety or efficacy observations made in clinical trials, including previously unreported adverse events. Results from preclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we and collaborators we may be working with believe the preclinical or clinical data for our product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Administering product candidates to humans may produce undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities denying approval of a product candidate for any or all targeted indications. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and the results of clinical trials by other parties may not be indicative of the results in trials we may conduct. The number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for approval varies depending on the product candidate, the disease or condition that the product candidate is designed to address, and the regulations applicable to any particular product candidate.\nThe FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf\nour inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body that the product candidate is safe and effective for the requested indication;\n\u25cf\nthe FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory body\u2019s disagreement with design or implementation of our clinical trials or the interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nserious and unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials or by individuals using drugs similar to our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nour inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of the product candidate outweigh any safety or other perceived risks;\n\u25cf\nthe FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory body\u2019s requirement for additional preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nthe FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory body\u2019s non-approval of the product candidate\u2019s chemistry, manufacturing or controls or labeling;\n\u25cf\nthe FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory body\u2019s failure to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers and testing labs with whom we contract; or\n\u25cf\nthe potential for approval policies or regulations of the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory bodies to change significantly in a manner rendering our clinical data or regulatory filings insufficient for approval.\nIf LIPO-202, or any of our other or future product candidates, fails to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials or does not gain regulatory approval, our business and results of operations will be materially and adversely harmed. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA or other regulatory approval processes and are commercialized. Further, we are not conducting our clinical trials under a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. In the absence of an agreed SPA, there can be no assurance that the FDA will agree with our clinical trial protocol.\nFurthermore, the FDA has not confirmed that our proposed indication, endpoints and endpoint measurement tools are acceptable for regulatory approval. In addition, in our End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, the FDA expressed concerns regarding whether our proposed secondary endpoint measurement tools are acceptable for regulatory approval and raised the issue of whether a more appropriate physical measure of reduction of central abdominal bulging or subcutaneous fat could be obtained using other measurement tools, such as 2-D ultrasound. There are no assurances that the FDA will approve our NDA for LIPO-202, will agree that the effects are meaningful to patients and the benefits of LIPO-202 outweigh its risks, or will not raise new concerns regarding our clinical designs. Even if we eventually complete clinical testing and receive approval of an NDA for LIPO-202, LIPO-102 or any other product candidate, the FDA or other regulatory bodies may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional clinical trials which may be required after approval. The FDA or other regulatory bodies also may approve a product candidate for a more limited indication or a narrower patient population than we originally requested, and the FDA or other regulatory bodies may not approve the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of the product candidate.\nIf the FDA does not conclude that our product candidates satisfy the requirements for the 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, or if the requirements for approval of any of our product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) are not as we expect, the approval pathway for our product candidates will likely take significantly longer, cost significantly more and encounter significantly greater complications and risks than anticipated, and in any case may not be successful.\nWe intend to seek FDA approval through the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for each of our product candidates described in this document. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, added Section 505(b)(2) to the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies that were not conducted by or for the applicant, and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. As described above, we generally intend to rely to some degree on the FDA\u2019s finding of safety for, and approval of, another product containing the same active ingredient as our product candidate.\nIf the FDA does not allow us to pursue the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for our product candidates as anticipated, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials, provide additional data and information and meet additional standards for regulatory approval. If this were to occur, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for our product candidates would likely substantially increase. Moreover, the inability to pursue the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway could result in new competitive products reaching the market faster than our product candidates, which could materially adversely impact our competitive position and prospects. Even if we are allowed to pursue the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for a product candidate, we cannot assure you that we will receive the requisite or timely approvals for commercialization of such product candidate.\nThe environment in which our regulatory submissions may be reviewed changes over time, which may make it more difficult to obtain regulatory approval of any of our product candidates.\nThe environment in which our regulatory submissions may be reviewed changes over time. For example, although there are PDUFA review goals that the agency must abide by, average total review times at the FDA for NDAs have fluctuated over the last ten years, and we cannot predict the review time for any of our submissions, with any regulatory authorities. Review times can be affected by a variety of factors, including budget and funding levels and statutory, regulatory and policy changes. Moreover, in light of widely publicized events concerning the safety risk of certain drug products, regulatory authorities, members of Congress, the Government Accountability Office, medical professionals and the general public have raised concerns about potential drug safety issues. These events have resulted in the withdrawal of drug products, revisions to drug labeling that further limit use of the drug products and establishment of REMS programs that may, for instance, restrict distribution of drug products. The increased attention to drug safety issues may result in a more cautious approach by the FDA to clinical trials. Data from preclinical studies and clinical trials may receive greater scrutiny with respect to safety, which may make the FDA or other regulatory authorities more likely to terminate clinical trials before completion, or require longer or additional clinical trials that may result in substantial additional expense, a delay or failure in obtaining approval or approval for a more limited indication than originally sought.\nIn addition, data obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials are subject to different interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory review or approval of any of our product candidates. Changes in FDA personnel responsible for review of our submissions could also impact the manner in which our data are viewed. Furthermore, regulatory attitudes toward the data and results required to demonstrate safety and efficacy can change over time and can be affected by many factors, such as the emergence of new information, including on other products, policy changes and agency funding, staffing and leadership. We do not know whether future changes to the regulatory environment will be favorable or unfavorable to our business prospects.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, any product candidates, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and market withdrawal and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our products.\nAny regulatory approvals that we or our collaborators receive for LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. In addition, if the applicable regulatory agency approves LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements.\nOur contract manufacturers (which we will be responsible for monitoring) will be required to register the facilities used to manufacture our API and finished drug products, which will be subject to periodic inspection and audit by the FDA and applicable regulatory agencies to confirm that we and our products are in compliance with all applicable regulations including cGMPs and GCP. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control. FDA may hold us responsible for any deficiencies or noncompliance of our contract manufacturers in relation to our products. Failure to follow cGMP can result in products being deemed adulterated, which carries significant legal implications. Adverse inspectional findings, if not promptly corrected, may result in Warning Letters or further escalation of enforcement action, including suspension or withdrawal of approval, among other things.\nWe will also be required to engage in pharmacovigilance activities and report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved label. As such, we may not promote our products for indications or uses for which they do not have approval. Failure to comply with FDA advertising and promotion standards, which are often subject to interpretation by regulators, may result in a wide range of exposure and liability for us.\nLater discovery of previously unknown problems with LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u25cf\nfines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nrefusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our strategic collaborators, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;\n\u25cf\nproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n\u25cf\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nRegulatory agency policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates, or limit our activities if approval is obtained. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.\nOur product candidates may have undesirable side effects that may delay or prevent marketing approval, or, if approval is received, require them to be taken off the market or otherwise limit their sales. If approved, LIPO-202 or any of our other products may cause or contribute to adverse medical events that we are required to report to regulatory bodies and if we fail to do so, we could be subject to sanctions that would materially harm our business.\nUnforeseen side effects from any of our product candidates could arise either during clinical development or, if approved, after the product has been marketed. Some participants in our clinical trials have reported adverse effects after being treated with LIPO-202. If we are successful in commercializing LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates, FDA and foreign regulatory agency regulations generally require that we collect, review, and report certain information about adverse events, experiences, and reactions of patients who were using our products. We must evaluate information from any source, foreign or domestic, and regulators evaluate safety information on a global basis. Thus, safety information that emerges in one country may be relevant to the regulation of our product in other countries. The timing of our obligation to report would be triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events we become aware of within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to appreciate that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of our products. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA or a foreign regulatory agency could take action including criminal prosecution, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, seizure of our products, or delay in approval or clearance of future products. Emerging safety information could also be used in product liability litigation against us.\nIf LIPO-202 or any of our other current or future product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such product, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u25cf\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product;\n\u25cf\nwe may be required to recall a product or change the way such product is administered to patients;\n\u25cf\nadditional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of the particular product or the manufacturing processes for the product or any component thereof;\n\u25cf\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \u201cboxed warning\u201d or \u201cblack box\u201d warning or a contraindication; we may be required to implement a REMS or create a Medication Guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u25cf\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u25cf\nthe product may become less competitive; and\n\u25cf\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of the foregoing events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and result in the loss of significant revenues to us, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nWe may not be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for LIPO-102.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is defined as a disease or condition that affects a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product generally is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, during which the FDA generally is precluded from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same orphan-designated indication. The exclusivity period can be broken in limited circumstances, including if the subsequent product is shown to be clinically superior to the product with orphan exclusivity, by virtue of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or making a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity also may be lost if the FDA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Additionally, orphan drug exclusivity does not prohibit the FDA from approving a different active ingredient for the same orphan indication, or the same active ingredient for other indications.\nAlthough we have obtained orphan drug designation for LIPO-102 for treatment of symptomatic exophthalmos associated with thyroid related eye disease, we may never obtain marketing approval for this drug, or for this use. Even if we are the first company to receive marketing approval for this indication and receive orphan drug exclusivity for this product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition for the reasons described above. Additionally, orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug, nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nWe may be subject to various U.S. federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, false claims, physician payment transparency and fraud laws, and any violations by us of such laws could result in fines or other penalties.\nWhile we do not expect that LIPO-202, if approved, will be covered for patients in whole or in part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs, we may still be subject to the various U.S. federal and state laws intended to prevent healthcare fraud and abuse that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. In addition, should we receive approval for our follow-on product, LIPO-102, it may be covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u25cf\nthe federal Anti-Kickback statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of an item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Where it applies, the Anti-Kickback statute may restrict, among other things, our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies and relationships with healthcare providers. Liability may be established under the federal Anti-Kickback statute without proving actual knowledge of the statute or a specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common manufacturer business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanction under the Anti-Kickback statute, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor;\n\u25cf\nthe federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment of government funds; knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Many manufacturers or other healthcare companies have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government for a variety of alleged improper marketing activities, including for causing false claims to be submitted by providing inappropriate or incorrect coding and billing advice to customers, promotion of products off-label (for unapproved indications), distribution of products that fail to meet GMPs, and a number of other alleged marketing activities;\n\u25cf\nthe federal criminal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact, making a materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing that it contains any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u25cf\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and its implementing regulations, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, also imposes certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u25cf\nthe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act (enacted by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Affordable Care Act)), which requires certain applicable manufacturers of covered drugs or devices to engage in extensive tracking of payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, or ownership and investment interests held by physicians, and to submit such data to CMS for public reporting on the CMS website. Manufacturers with products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program are required to have begun tracking reportable payments on August 1, 2013, and must submit a report on or before the 90th day of each calendar year disclosing reportable payments made in the previous calendar year.. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for \u201cknowing failures\u201d); and\n\u25cf\nanalogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by Medicaid or other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer; state laws that require drug manufacturers to implement compliance programs or marketing codes and/or to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to certain healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that prohibit certain marketing-related activities including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain healthcare providers; and state laws governing the privacy and security of certain health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our future business activities, including our relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from governmental healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nThe risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully or definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations.\nState and federal authorities have aggressively targeted pharmaceutical and medical technology companies for alleged violations of these anti-fraud statutes, based on a variety of alleged conduct including improper research or consulting contracts with physicians, certain marketing arrangements that rely on volume-based pricing, off-label marketing schemes, and other improper promotional practices. Companies targeted in such prosecutions or investigations have paid substantial fines in the hundreds of millions of dollars or more, have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans, and have often become subject to consent decrees severely restricting the manner in which they conduct their businesses. If we become the target of such an investigation or prosecution in the future based on our contractual relationships with providers or institutions, or our marketing and promotional practices, we could face similar sanctions, which would materially harm our business.\nAlso, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to foreign officials, political parties or candidates for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. We cannot assure you that our internal safeguards and control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, consultants, future distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties, or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nLegislative or regulatory healthcare reforms in the United States may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory approval of LIPO-202 or any of our other current or future product candidates and to produce, market, and distribute our products if approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory clearance or approval, manufacture, and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of LIPO-202 or any of our other current or future product candidates. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require:\n\u25cf\nchanges to manufacturing, testing or distribution methods;\n\u25cf\nadditional pharmacovigilance or safety requirements;\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on advertising and promotional activities;\n\u25cf\nrevised standards for demonstrating safety or effectiveness;\n\u25cf\nrecall, replacement, or discontinuance of one or more of our products; and\n\u25cf\nadditional record keeping.\nEach of these would likely entail substantial time and cost and could materially harm our business and our financial results. In addition, delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory clearances or approvals for any current or future product candidates would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCoverage and reimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for certain of our product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell our product candidates profitably.\nGiven the cosmetic nature and intent of LIPO-202, we do not anticipate that government or commercial payors will pay for this product. Thus, a customer would have to pay for the LIPO-202 out-of-pocket. While customers may be willing to pay the entire cost of the product, the inability to receive reimbursement from the government or a third party for the use of the product makes our situation different from that of many pharmaceutical companies offering drugs in the United States.\nAlthough we do not anticipate any government or private payor coverage for LIPO-202, and we are not currently actively developing our LIPO-102 program, to the extent we do pursue commercialization of LIPO-102, we anticipate that market acceptance and sale of LIPO-102 in the future, will depend, in part, on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for such product candidates and may be affected by existing and future healthcare reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors including the third-party payor\u2019s determination that use of a product candidate is:\n\u25cf\na covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u25cf\nsafe, effective and medically necessary;\n\u25cf\nappropriate for the specific patient;\n\u25cf\ncost-effective; and\n\u25cf\nneither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product candidate from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of the applicable product candidate to the payor. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. We cannot be sure that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be available for LIPO-102. Further, reimbursement amounts may reduce the demand for, or the price of, our product candidates. If reimbursement is not available or is available only in limited levels, we may not be able to commercialize LIPO-102 profitably, or at all, even if approved.\nAs a result of legislative proposals and the trend toward managed healthcare in the United States, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. By way of example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted with a goal of reducing the cost of healthcare and substantially changing the way healthcare is financed by both government and private insurers. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; extended manufacturer rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program from fee-for-service utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well; expanded the Public Health Service\u2019s 340B drug pricing program; and established annual fees on manufacturers of certain prescription drugs.\nOther legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2%, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislation, will stay in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken.\nWe expect that additional healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal, state and foreign governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for certain of our products, if approved, or additional pricing pressures.\nIn addition, if LIPO-102 or any other product candidates that we may develop and successfully commercialize in the future are covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental health care programs, and we elect to participate in such programs, we would be subject to the requirements imposed by the programs. In general, these requirements include, among other things, paying rebates or providing discounts to government payors in connection with our commercialized products that are dispensed to beneficiaries of these programs. In order for federal funds to be available for a manufacturer\u2019s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B, a manufacturer that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program must also participate in the Public Health Service\u2019s 340B drug pricing program. Federal law also requires that for a drug manufacturer\u2019s products to be eligible for payment with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and to be purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, the manufacturer must participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program, established by Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, or VHCA. In addition, if our product becomes available in the retail pharmacy setting when it is commercialized, we would be required to provide rebates to Department of Defense, or DoD, for prescriptions dispensed to Tricare beneficiaries from Tricare retail network pharmacies under the Tricare Retail Refund Program. These programs obligate the manufacturer to pay rebates and offer its drugs at certain prices to certain federal purchasers. To the extent we choose to participate in these government healthcare programs, these and other requirements may affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nThe Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and other governmental pricing programs also require manufacturers to report pricing data to the government, such as average manufacturer price data, and in the case of innovator products, best price data as well, in connection with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, average sales price in connection with Medicare Part B, and non-federal average manufacturer price in connection with the FSS pricing program. If we successfully commercialize any of our product candidates and participate in such governmental pricing programs, we will be liable for errors or delays associated with our submission of pricing data. That liability could be significant. For example, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false average manufacturer price, average sales price, best price, or non-federal average manufacturer price information to the government, we may be liable for civil monetary penalties in the amount of $100,000 per item of false information. If we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of average sales price, the statute provides for civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each misrepresentation for each day in which the misrepresentation was applied. Our failure to submit monthly/quarterly average manufacturer price, average sales price, or best price, or quarterly/annual non-federal average manufacturer price data on a timely basis could result in a civil monetary penalty of $10,000 per day for each day the information is late beyond the due date. Such failure also could be grounds for other sanctions, such as termination from the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Any allegations against us under these laws, including the Federal False Claims Act, could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the initial purchase price.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations as a result of many risks listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7\nadverse results or delays in clinical trials;\n\u25cf\ninability to obtain additional funding;\n\u25cf\nfailure to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our products, if approved;\n\u25cf\ninability to obtain adequate product supply for our product candidates, or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u25cf\nadverse regulatory decisions;\n\u25cf\nintroduction of new products or technologies by our competitors;\n\u25cf\nfailure to meet or exceed product development or financial projections we provide to the public;\n\u25cf\nthe perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u25cf\nsignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u25cf\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future; and\n\u25cf\ntrading volume of our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that may have been unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our common stock. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer. If any of our stockholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the attention of our management would be diverted from the operation of our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our clinical trials and operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained\nWe completed our IPO in November 2014. Following completion of our IPO, an active trading market may not be sustained. The lack of an active trading market may impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other businesses, applications, or technologies using our shares of common stock as consideration.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and may remain an emerging growth company for up to five years. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include:\n\u25cf\nbeing permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d disclosure;\n\u25cf\nnot being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u25cf\nnot being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u25cf\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n\u25cf\nexemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe have taken advantage of reduced reporting burdens in this document. In particular, in this document we have provided only two years of audited financial statements and have not included all of the executive compensation related information that would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our principle stockholders, executive officers, directors and their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 76% of our outstanding voting stock. Therefore, these stockholders have the ability to influence us through this ownership position and may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or may fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, each of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations. Our net loss and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nvariations in the level of expenses related to LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates;\n\u2022\nif LIPO-202 receives regulatory approval, the level of underlying demand for this product candidate and wholesalers\u2019 buying patterns;\n\u2022\naddition or termination of clinical trials or funding support;\n\u2022\nour execution of any collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements.\n\u2022\nany intellectual property infringement lawsuit in which we may become involved; and\n\u2022\nregulatory developments affecting our LIPO-202 or any of our other current and future product candidates or those of our competitors.\nIf our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nSubstantially all of our existing stockholder, other than those participating in our IPO, are subject to lock-up agreements with the underwriters of our IPO that restrict the stockholders\u2019 ability to transfer shares of our common stock for 180 days from the date of the final prospectus for our IPO, subject to certain exceptions. The lock-up agreements limit the number of shares of common stock that may be sold prior to the expiration of the lock-up agreements; however, the underwriters may, in their discretion, permit our officers, directors and other stockholders who are subject to these lock-up agreements to sell shares prior to the expiration of the lock-up agreements. Subject to certain limitations, including sales volume limitations with respect to shares held by our affiliates, substantially all of our outstanding shares prior to our IPO will become eligible for sale upon expiration of the lock-up period or May 18, 2015. In addition, shares issued or issuable upon exercise of options and warrants vested as of the expiration of the lock-up period will be eligible for sale at that time. Sales of stock by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nCertain holders of our securities are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, subject to the 180-day lock-up arrangement described above. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. Any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nPursuant to our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2014 Plan, our management is authorized to grant stock options and other equity-based awards to our employees, directors and consultants. In addition, we have a number of outstanding awards under our 2007 Stock Plan, or 2007 Plan. The number of shares available for future grant under the 2014 plan will automatically increase on January 1 of each year by 4% of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, subject to the ability of our board of directors to take action to reduce the size of the increase in any given year. In addition, we may grant or provide for the grant of rights to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP. The number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the 2014 ESPP will automatically increase on January 1 of each calendar year by 1% of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, subject to the ability of our board of directors to take action to reduce the size of the increase in any given year. We have filed a registration statement permitting shares of common stock issued or issuable in the future pursuant to the 2007 Plan, 2014 Plan and 2014 ESPP to be freely resold by plan participants in the public market, subject to the lock-up agreements, applicable vesting schedules and, for shares held by directors, executive officers and other affiliates, volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Currently, we plan to register the increased number of shares available for issuance under the 2014 plan and 2014 ESPP each year. Increases in the number of shares available for future grant or purchase may result in additional dilution, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe have broad discretion to determine how to use our cash, and may use them in ways that may not enhance our operating results or the price of our common stock.\nOur management will have broad discretion over the use of our cash, and we could spend our cash in ways our stockholders may not agree with or that do not yield a favorable return, if at all. We currently expect to use substantially all of the net proceeds from our IPO to fund our U.S. Phase 3 clinical trials of LIPO-202, and the remainder for general corporate purposes, including our planned research, clinical trial and product development activities. However, our use of cash, including the proceeds from our IPO may differ substantially from our current plans. If we do not invest or apply our cash in ways that improve our operating results, we may fail to achieve expected financial results, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current directors and management team, and limit the market price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws became effective immediately prior to the completion of our IPO contain provisions that could delay or prevent changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include the following:\n\u25cf\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u25cf\nprohibiting our stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders or acting by written consent;\n\u25cf\npermitting our board to issue additional shares of our preferred stock, with such rights, preferences and privileges as they may designate, including the right to approve an acquisition or other changes in control;\n\u25cf\nestablishing an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u25cf\nproviding that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n\u25cf\nproviding that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; and\n\u25cf\nrequiring the approval of our board of directors or the holders of a supermajority of our outstanding shares of capital stock to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nAlthough we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management team by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The restrictions contained in Section 203 are not applicable to any of our existing stockholders prior to IPO that own 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock upon the completion of our IPO.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws that became effective immediately prior to the completion of our IPO provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.\nIn addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and officers provide that:\n\u25cf\nWe will indemnify our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person\u2019s conduct was unlawful.\n\u25cf\nWe may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law.\n\u25cf\nWe are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.\n\u25cf\nWe will not be obligated pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws to indemnify a person with respect to proceedings initiated by that person against us or our other indemnitees, except with respect to proceedings authorized by our board of directors or brought to enforce a right to indemnification.\n\u25cf\nThe rights conferred in our amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons.\n\u25cf\nWe may not retroactively amend our bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees and agents.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Additionally, the terms of our credit facility restrict our ability to pay dividends. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future. Since we do not intend to pay dividends, your ability to receive a return on your investment will depend on any future appreciation in the market value of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate or even maintain the price at which our holders have purchased it.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. In addition, if our operating results fail to meet the forecast of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 15075, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "EVFM"}
