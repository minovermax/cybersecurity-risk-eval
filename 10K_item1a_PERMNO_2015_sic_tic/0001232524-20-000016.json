{"cik": "1232524", "company": "Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nWe have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations. Our business could be harmed by any of these risks. The trading price of our ordinary shares could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nRisks Related to Our Lead Products and Product Candidates\nOur inability to maintain or increase sales from our sleep therapeutic area would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur current business is substantially dependent on Xyrem\u00ae (sodium oxybate) oral solution, and our financial results are significantly influenced by sales of Xyrem. A significant decline in sales of Xyrem could cause us to reduce our operating expenses or seek to raise additional funds, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects, including on our ability to acquire, in-license or develop new products to grow our business. While our future plans assume that sales of Xyrem will increase, there is no guarantee that we can maintain sales of Xyrem at or near current levels, or that Xyrem sales will continue to grow. Our ability to maintain or increase Xyrem product\nsales is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as discussed in greater detail below, including those related to the introduction of authorized generic and generic versions of sodium oxybate and/or new products for treatment of cataplexy and/or excessive daytime sleepiness, or EDS, in narcolepsy in the U.S. market, increased pricing pressure from, changes in policies by, or restrictions on reimbursement imposed by, third party payors, challenges to our intellectual property around Xyrem, and continued acceptance of Xyrem by physicians and patients.\nAs for other products and product candidates in our sleep and neuroscience therapeutic area, we obtained approval of Sunosi\u00ae (solriamfetol) in 2019 in the U.S. and in January 2020 in the European Union, or EU, for the treatment of EDS associated with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea, or OSA. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from our investment in Sunosi is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including market acceptance of Sunosi; our ability, in a competitive retail pharmacy market, to differentiate Sunosi from other products that are prescribed to treat excessive sleepiness in patients with OSA or EDS in patients with narcolepsy; the availability of adequate formulary positions and pricing and adequate coverage and reimbursement by government programs and other third party payors, including the impact of future coverage decisions by payors; restrictions on permitted promotional activities based on any additional limitations on the labeling for the product that may be required by the FDA in the future and any such limitations that may be required by the European Commission, or the EC, or other regulatory authority on any approved labeling; and our ability to satisfy the FDA\u2019s post-marketing requirements.\nWe also submitted a new drug application, or NDA, in January 2020 for marketing approval of JZP-258, an oxybate product candidate that contains 92%, or approximately 1,000 to 1,500 milligrams per day, less sodium than Xyrem, for the treatment of cataplexy and EDS in narcolepsy patients seven years of age and older. Our future plans assume that, if approved, JZP-258 may be prescribed to patients as a safer and clinically superior alternative to Xyrem as well as being prescribed to patients who may otherwise be ineligible to take Xyrem based on its high sodium content. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from our investment in JZP-258 is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including delay or failure in obtaining approval of JZP-258; our receipt of approval for narrower indications than sought or burdens in the approved label; obtaining FDA approval of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS; obtaining and maintaining adequate coverage and reimbursement for JZP-258; the introduction of new products in the U.S. market that compete with JZP-258 in the treatment of cataplexy and/or EDS in narcolepsy, including generic or authorized generic versions of sodium oxybate or new sodium oxybate products; and acceptance of JZP-258 by payors, physicians and patients.\nIf we are unable to successfully commercialize Sunosi and/or JZP-258 (if approved), or if sales of Sunosi and JZP-258 do not reach the levels we expect, our anticipated revenue from our sleep therapeutic area will be negatively affected, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe introduction of new products in the U.S. market that compete with, or otherwise disrupt the market for, our oxybate products and product candidates would adversely affect sales of our oxybate products and product candidates.\nWhile Xyrem is currently the only product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and marketed in the U.S. for the treatment of both cataplexy and EDS in both adult and pediatric patients with narcolepsy, we and others have launched and may in the future launch products that are competitive with or disrupt the market for Xyrem.\nFor example, in the future, we expect Xyrem to face competition from authorized generic and generic versions of sodium oxybate. Nine companies have sent us notices that they had filed abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, seeking approval to market a generic version of Xyrem, and we have filed and settled patent lawsuits with all nine companies. To date, the FDA has approved or tentatively approved four of these ANDAs, and we believe that it is likely that the FDA will approve or tentatively approve some or all of the others. In our patent litigation settlement with the first filer, West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC and now known as Hikma in the U.S.), or Hikma, we granted Hikma the right to sell an authorized generic product, or AG Product, with royalties back to us, in the U.S. beginning on January 1, 2023, or earlier under certain circumstances. Hikma has a right to elect to continue to sell the Hikma AG Product for a total of up to five years. We also granted Hikma a license to launch its own generic sodium oxybate product as early as six months after it has the right to sell the Hikma AG Product, but if it elects to launch its own generic product, Hikma will no longer have the right to sell the Hikma AG Product. In our settlements with Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC, or Amneal, Lupin Inc., or Lupin, and Par Pharmaceutical, Inc., or Par, we granted each party the right to sell a limited volume of an AG Product in the U.S. beginning on July 1, 2023, or earlier under certain circumstances, and ending on December 31, 2025, with royalties back to us. AG Products will be distributed through the same REMS as Xyrem and, if approved, JZP 258. We also granted each of Amneal, Lupin and Par a license to launch its own generic sodium oxybate product under its ANDA on or after December 31, 2025, or earlier under certain circumstances, including the circumstance where Hikma elects to launch its own generic product. If Amneal, Lupin or Par elects to launch its own generic product under such circumstance, it will no longer have the right to sell an AG Product. In our settlements with each of the other five ANDA filers, we granted each a license to launch its own generic sodium oxybate product under its ANDA on or after December 31, 2025, or earlier under certain circumstances, including circumstances where Hikma launches its own generic sodium oxybate product. The actual timing of the launch of an AG Product or generic sodium oxybate product is uncertain because the launch dates of the AG\nProducts and generic sodium oxybate products under our settlement agreements are subject to acceleration under certain circumstances.\nAny ANDA holder launching an AG Product or another generic sodium oxybate product will independently establish the price of the AG Product and/or its own generic sodium oxybate product. Generic competition often results in decreases in the prices at which branded products can be sold. After any introduction of a generic product, whether or not it is an AG Product, a significant percentage of the prescriptions written for Xyrem will likely be filled with the generic product. Certain U.S. state laws allow for, and in some instances in the absence of specific instructions from the prescribing physician mandate, the dispensing of generic products rather than branded products when a generic version is available. This would result in reduction in sales of, and revenue from, Xyrem, although we would continue to receive royalties and other revenue based on sales of an AG Product in accordance with the terms of our settlement agreements.\nIt is possible that additional companies may file ANDAs seeking to market a generic version of Xyrem which could lead to additional patent litigation or challenges with respect to Xyrem. Such patent litigation or challenges could potentially trigger acceleration of the launch dates in our settlement agreements if, for example, our patents covering Xyrem were all invalidated. Alternatively, the launch dates in our settlement agreements could be accelerated if a new ANDA filer were to obtain FDA approval for its sodium oxybate product, and launch its generic product through a generic sodium oxybate REMS before the entry dates specified in our settlement agreements. It is also possible that we could enter into a settlement agreement with a future ANDA filer that would permit such filer to enter the market on or prior to the launch date(s) in our settlement agreements. If a company launches a generic or authorized generic sodium oxybate product in any of these scenarios, except in limited circumstances related to an \u201cat risk\u201d launch, the launch date for Hikma\u2019s AG Product would be accelerated to a date on or prior to the date of such entry, which could lead to acceleration of the other settling ANDA filers\u2019 AG Product and generic sodium oxybate product launch dates as described above.\nAnother circumstance that could trigger acceleration of Hikma\u2019s launch date for an AG Product, which would also accelerate Amneal, Lupin and Par\u2019s launch dates for their AG Products and ultimately could lead to acceleration of the other settling ANDA filers\u2019 launch dates for their generic sodium oxybate products, is a substantial reduction in Xyrem net sales. Such a reduction could occur under various circumstances, including if we introduce, or a third party introduces, a product to treat EDS or cataplexy in narcolepsy that leads to a substantial decline in Xyrem net sales prior to January 1, 2023. Other companies may develop a sodium oxybate product for treatment of narcolepsy, using an alternative formulation or a different delivery technology, and seek approval in the U.S. using an NDA approval pathway under Section 505(b)(2) and referencing the safety and efficacy data for Xyrem. We are aware that Avadel Pharmaceuticals plc, or Avadel, is conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial of a once-nightly formulation of sodium oxybate which uses its proprietary technology for the treatment of EDS and cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy, and that Avadel has indicated that it intends to seek approval using the Section 505(b)(2) approval pathway referencing the safety and efficacy data for Xyrem. Xyrem may also face competition from new branded entrants to treat EDS in narcolepsy such as pitolisant. Other companies have announced that they have product candidates in various phases of development to treat the symptoms of narcolepsy, such as Axsome Therapeutics, Inc.\u2019s reboxetine.\nWe expect that, if approved, JZP-258, will face competition similar to that described above for Xyrem, including from generic or authorized generic sodium oxybate product or new branded entrants in narcolepsy such as Avadel. Avadel has announced that it has obtained an orphan drug designation from the FDA for its once-nightly sodium oxybate formulation. To obtain orphan drug exclusivity upon approval, Avadel will have to show clinical superiority to Xyrem and possibly to JZP-258, if approved. If the FDA approves Avadel\u2019s product and grants it orphan drug exclusivity before we obtain approval for JZP-258, there is a risk that JZP-258 will not be approvable for a narcolepsy indication for seven years unless it can establish clinical superiority to Avadel\u2019s product. We cannot predict the timing of Avadel\u2019s submission or how the FDA will evaluate any clinical superiority arguments that either company may make, but a delay in approval or inability to obtain approval for JZP-258 could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nMoreover, non-oxybate products intended for the treatment of EDS or cataplexy in narcolepsy, including new market entrants, even if not directly competitive with Xyrem or JZP-258 (if approved), could have the effect of changing treatment regimens and payor or formulary coverage of Xyrem or JZP-258 in favor of other products, and indirectly materially and adversely affect sales of Xyrem (and if approved, JZP-258). Examples of such new market entrants include our product, Sunosi, and pitolisant, a drug that was approved by the FDA in August 2019 for the treatment of EDS in adult patients with narcolepsy and became commercially available in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2019, and that has also been approved and marketed in Europe to treat adult patients with narcolepsy with or without cataplexy. In addition, prescribers often prescribe stimulants or wake-promoting agents for treatment of EDS, and anti-depressants for cataplexy, before or instead of prescribing Xyrem, and payors often require patients to try such medications before they will cover Xyrem. Examples of such products are described in \u201cBusiness-Competition\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe expect that the approval and launch of an AG Product or other generic version of Xyrem could have a material adverse effect on our sales of and revenues from Xyrem and on our business, financial condition, results of operations and\ngrowth prospects. We also expect that the approval and launch of any other sodium oxybate (including JZP-258 or Avadel\u2019s once-nightly sodium oxybate formulation) or alternative product that treats narcolepsy could have a material adverse effect on our sales of and revenues from Xyrem, which could have the additional impact of potentially triggering acceleration of market entry of AG Products or other generic sodium oxybate products under our ANDA litigation settlement agreements.\nThe distribution and sale of our oxybate products are subject to significant regulatory restrictions, including the requirements of a REMS, and these regulatory requirements subject us to risks and uncertainties, any of which could negatively impact sales of Xyrem and if approved, JZP-258.\nThe active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, of Xyrem, sodium oxybate, is the sodium salt of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, or GHB, a central nervous system depressant known to be associated with facilitated sexual assault as well as with respiratory depression and other serious side effects. As a result, the FDA requires that we maintain a REMS with elements to assure safe use, or ETASU, for Xyrem to help ensure that the benefits of the drug in the treatment of cataplexy and EDS in narcolepsy outweigh the serious risks of the drug. The REMS imposes extensive controls and restrictions on the sales and marketing of Xyrem that we are responsible for implementing. Any failure to demonstrate our substantial compliance with our REMS obligations, or a determination by the FDA that the Xyrem REMS is not meeting its goals, could result in enforcement action by the FDA, lead to changes in our Xyrem REMS obligations, negatively affect sales of Xyrem, result in additional costs and expenses for us and/or require us to invest a significant amount of resources, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Similarly, we expect that the FDA will require approval of a REMS for JZP-258, and a delay in obtaining such approval could delay our anticipated launch of JZP-258, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe FDA has stated that it will evaluate the Xyrem REMS on an ongoing basis and will require modifications as may be appropriate. We cannot predict whether the FDA will request, seek to require or ultimately require modifications to, or impose additional requirements on, the Xyrem REMS, including in connection with the submission of applications for new oxybate products including JZP-258, new oxybate indications, the introduction of authorized generics, or to accommodate generics, or whether the FDA will approve modifications to the Xyrem REMS that we consider warranted in connection with the submission of applications for new oxybate products including JZP-258. Any modifications approved, required or rejected by the FDA could change the safety profile of Xyrem, and have a significant negative impact in terms of product liability, public acceptance of Xyrem as a treatment for cataplexy and EDS in narcolepsy, and prescribers\u2019 willingness to prescribe, and patients\u2019 willingness to take, Xyrem, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our Xyrem business. Modifications approved, required or rejected by the FDA could also make it more difficult or expensive for us to distribute Xyrem, make distribution easier for sodium oxybate competitors, disrupt continuity of care for Xyrem patients and/or negatively affect sales of Xyrem.\nWe depend on outside vendors, including the central certified pharmacy, to implement the requirements of the Xyrem REMS. If the central pharmacy fails to meet the requirements of the Xyrem REMS applicable to the central pharmacy or otherwise does not fulfill its contractual obligations to us, moves to terminate our agreement, refuses or fails to adequately serve patients, or fails to promptly and adequately address operational challenges or challenges in implementing REMS modifications, the fulfillment of Xyrem prescriptions and our sales would be adversely affected. If we change to a new central pharmacy, new contracts might be required with government payors and other insurers who pay for Xyrem, and the terms of any new contracts could be less favorable to us than current agreements. In addition, any new central pharmacy would need to be registered with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, and certified and would also need to implement the particular processes, procedures and activities necessary to distribute Xyrem under the Xyrem REMS. Transitioning to a new pharmacy could result in product shortages, which would negatively affect sales of Xyrem, result in additional costs and expenses for us and/or take a significant amount of time, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIn its approval of Hikma\u2019s ANDA, the FDA waived the requirement of a single shared REMS between the brand drug and generic versions, approving Hikma\u2019s ANDA with a generic sodium oxybate REMS separate from the Xyrem REMS, except for the requirement that the generic sodium oxybate REMS program pharmacies contact the Xyrem REMS by phone to verify and report certain information. The generic sodium oxybate REMS was approved with the condition that it be open to all future sponsors of ANDAs or NDAs for sodium oxybate products. A sodium oxybate distribution system that is less restrictive than the Xyrem REMS, such as the generic sodium oxybate REMS, which provides that generic sodium oxybate products and potentially new sodium oxybate products approved under a Section 505(b)(2) NDA approval pathway could be distributed through multiple pharmacies, could increase the risks associated with sodium oxybate distribution. Because patients, consumers and others may not differentiate generic sodium oxybate from Xyrem or differentiate between the different REMS programs, any negative outcomes, including risks to the public, caused by or otherwise related to a separate sodium oxybate REMS, could have a significant negative impact in terms of product liability, our reputation and good will, public acceptance of Xyrem as a treatment for cataplexy and EDS in narcolepsy, and prescribers\u2019 willingness to prescribe, and patients\u2019 willingness to take, Xyrem, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our Xyrem business.\nWe may face pressure to further modify the Xyrem REMS or to license or share intellectual property pertinent to the Xyrem REMS, including proprietary data required for the safe distribution of sodium oxybate, in connection with the FDA\u2019s approval of the generic sodium oxybate REMS or otherwise. Our settlement agreements with ANDA filers do not directly impact the FDA\u2019s waiver of the single shared system REMS requirement, any other ANDA or NDA filer\u2019s ability to develop and implement the generic sodium oxybate REMS for its sodium oxybate product, or our ability to take any action with respect to the safety of the generic sodium oxybate REMS. We cannot predict the outcome or impact on our business of any future action that we may take with respect to the FDA\u2019s waiver of the single shared system REMS requirement, its approval and tentative approval of generic versions of sodium oxybate or the consequences of distribution of sodium oxybate through the generic sodium oxybate REMS approved by the FDA or another separate REMS.\nREMS programs have increasingly drawn public scrutiny from the U.S. Congress, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and the FDA, with allegations that such programs are used as a means of improperly blocking or delaying competition. In December 2019, as part of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020, the U.S. Congress passed legislation known as the Creating and Restoring Equal Access To Equivalent Samples Act, or CREATES. CREATES is intended to prevent companies from using REMS and other restricted distribution programs as a means to deny potential competitors access to product samples that are reasonably necessary to conduct testing in support of an application that references a listed drug or biologic, and provides such potential competitors a potential private right of action if the innovator fails to timely provide samples upon request. CREATES also grants the FDA additional authority regarding approval of generic products with REMS.\nIt is possible that the FTC, the FDA, other governmental authorities or other third parties could claim that, or launch an investigation into whether, we are using our REMS programs in an anticompetitive manner or have engaged in other anticompetitive practices. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act further states that a REMS ETASU shall not be used by an NDA holder to block or delay generic drugs or drugs covered by an application under Section 505(b)(2) from entering the market. In its 2015 letter approving the Xyrem REMS, the FDA expressed concern that we were aware that the Xyrem REMS could have the effect of blocking or delaying generic competition. We cannot predict whether we would face a government investigation or a complaint by a third party premised on a claim that the Xyrem REMS is blocking competition, or the outcome or impact of any such claim.\nPharmaceutical companies, including their agents and employees, are required to monitor adverse events occurring during the use of their products and report them to the FDA. The patient counseling and monitoring requirements of the Xyrem REMS provide more extensive information about adverse events experienced by patients taking Xyrem, including deaths, than is generally available for other products that are not subject to similar REMS requirements. As required by the FDA and other regulatory agencies, the adverse event information that we collect for Xyrem is regularly reported to the FDA and could result in the FDA requiring changes to Xyrem labeling, including additional warnings or additional boxed warnings, or requiring us to take other actions that could have an adverse effect on patient and prescriber acceptance of Xyrem. As required by the FDA, Xyrem\u2019s current labeling includes a boxed warning regarding the risk of central nervous system depression and misuse and abuse.\nAny failure to demonstrate our substantial compliance with the REMS or any other applicable regulatory requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA or another regulatory authority could result in such regulatory authorities taking actions in the future which could have a material adverse effect on Xyrem sales and therefore on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWhile Xyrem remains our largest product, our success also depends on our ability to effectively commercialize products outside our sleep and neuroscience therapeutic area.\nIn addition to Xyrem and our other sleep and neuroscience products and product candidates, we are commercializing a portfolio of products, including our other lead marketed products, Defitelio, Erwinaze and Vyxeos. An inability to effectively commercialize Defitelio and Vyxeos and to maximize their potential where possible through successful research and development activities, and an inability to retain marketing rights to Erwinaze after 2020, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nDefitelio\nOur ability to maintain and grow sales and to realize the anticipated benefits from our investment in Defitelio\u00ae (defibrotide sodium) is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including continued acceptance by hospital pharmacy and therapeutics committees in the U.S., the EU and other countries; the continued availability of favorable pricing and adequate coverage and reimbursement; the limited experience of, and need to educate, physicians in recognizing, diagnosing and treating hepatic veno-occlusive disease, or VOD, particularly in adults; the possibility that physicians recognizing VOD symptoms may not initiate or may delay initiation of treatment while waiting for those symptoms to improve, or may terminate treatment before the end of the recommended dosing schedule; and the limited size of the population of VOD patients who are indicated for treatment with Defitelio (particularly if changes in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation treatment protocols reduce the incidence of VOD diagnosis and demand for Defitelio). If sales of Defitelio do not reach the levels we expect, our\nanticipated revenue from the product will be negatively affected and our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected. In addition, because VOD is an ultra-rare disease, we have experienced inter-quarter variability in our Defitelio sales, which makes Defitelio sales difficult to predict from period to period. As a result, Defitelio sales results or trends in any period may not necessarily be indicative of future performance.\nErwinaze\nErwinaze\u00ae (asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi), which is approved to treat a limited population of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, who have developed hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase, is licensed from, and manufactured by, a single source, Porton Biopharma Limited, or PBL, a company that is wholly owned by the UK Department of Health and Social Care. Our license and supply agreement with PBL, which includes an exclusive right to market, sell or distribute Erwinaze, an exclusive license to Erwinaze trademarks, and a non-exclusive license to PBL\u2019s manufacturing know-how, will expire on December 31, 2020. Unless we and PBL enter into a new agreement, we will lose our licensed rights to exclusively market Erwinaze effective December 31, 2020, other than our right to sell certain Erwinaze inventory for a post-termination sales period of 12 months and certain other post-termination rights, including but not limited to intellectual property and data ownership. In such event, we may not be able to replace the product sales we would lose from Erwinaze, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects would be materially adversely affected. In addition, a continuing and significant challenge to maintaining sales of Erwinaze and a barrier to increasing sales is PBL\u2019s inability to consistently supply product that meets specifications in quantities that are adequate to meet market demand, as discussed elsewhere in these risk factors. Such supply instability will continue to adversely impact our ability to generate sales of and revenues from Erwinaze and our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected. Other challenges facing Erwinaze include the limited population of patients with ALL, and the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to E. coli-derived asparaginase within that population; the development and/or approval of new asparaginase treatments or treatment protocols for ALL that may not include asparaginase-containing regimens and prescribers\u2019 use of alternate methods to address hypersensitivity reactions; difficulties with obtaining and maintaining favorable pricing and reimbursement arrangements; and potential competition from future biosimilar products.\nVyxeos\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits from our investment in Vyxeos\u00ae (daunorubicin and cytarabine) liposome for injection by successfully and sustainably growing sales is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including our ability to differentiate Vyxeos from other liposomal chemotherapies and generically available chemotherapy combinations with which physicians and treatment centers are more familiar; acceptance by hospital pharmacy and therapeutics committees in the U.S., the EU and other countries; the increasing complexity of the acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, landscape requiring changes in patient identification and treatment selection, including diagnostic tests and monitoring that clinicians may find challenging to incorporate; the use of new and novel compounds in AML that are either used off-label or are only approved for use in combination with other agents and that have not been tested in combination with Vyxeos; the limited size of the population of high-risk AML patients who may potentially be indicated for treatment with Vyxeos; the availability of adequate coverage, pricing and reimbursement approvals, competition from new and existing products and potential competition from products in development; and delays or problems in the supply or manufacture of Vyxeos. If sales of Vyxeos do not reach the levels we expect, our anticipated revenue from the product will be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe face substantial competition from other companies, including companies with larger sales organizations and more experience working with large and diverse product portfolios.\nOur products compete, and our product candidates may in the future compete, with currently existing therapies, including generic drugs, product candidates currently under development by us and others and/or future product candidates, including new chemical entities that may be safer or more effective or more convenient than our products. Any products that we develop may be commercialized in competitive markets, and our competitors, which include large global pharmaceutical companies and small research-based companies and institutions, may succeed in developing products that render our products obsolete or noncompetitive. Many of our competitors, particularly large pharmaceutical and life sciences companies, have substantially greater financial, operational and human resources than we do. Smaller or earlier stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through focused development programs and collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. In addition, many of our competitors deploy more personnel to market and sell their products than we do, and we compete with other companies to recruit, hire, train and retain pharmaceutical sales and marketing personnel. If our sales force and sales support organization are not appropriately resourced and sized to adequately promote our products, the commercial potential of our current and any future products may be diminished. In any event, the commercial potential of our current products and any future products may be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop or acquire and commercialize generic or branded products that are safer or more effective, are more convenient or are less expensive than our products. For a description of the competition that our lead marketed products and most advanced product candidates face or may face, see the discussion in \u201cBusiness-Competition\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the risk\nfactor under the heading \u201cThe introduction of new products in the U.S. market that compete with, or otherwise disrupt the market for, our oxybate products and product candidates would adversely affect sales of our oxybate products and product candidates\u201d in this Part I, Item 1A.\nAdequate coverage and reimbursement from third party payors may not be available for our products, which could diminish our sales or affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nIn both U.S. and non-U.S. markets, our ability to successfully commercialize and achieve market acceptance of our products depends in significant part on adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third party payors, including governmental payors (such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the U.S.), managed care organizations and private health insurers. Without third party payor reimbursement, patients may not be able to obtain or afford prescribed medications. In addition, reimbursement guidelines and incentives provided to prescribing physicians by third party payors may have a significant impact on the prescribing physicians\u2019 willingness and ability to prescribe our products. The demand for, and the profitability of, our products could be materially harmed if the Medicaid program, Medicare program, other federal healthcare program, or other third party commercial payors in the U.S. or elsewhere deny reimbursement for our products, limit the indications for which our products will be reimbursed, or provide reimbursement only on unfavorable terms.\nAs part of the overall trend toward cost containment, third party payors often require prior authorization for, and require reauthorization for continuation of, prescription products or impose step edits, which require prior use of another medication, usually a generic or preferred brand, prior to approving coverage for a new or more expensive product. Such restrictive conditions for reimbursement and an increase in reimbursement-related activities can extend the time required to fill prescriptions and may discourage patients from seeking treatment. We cannot predict actions that third party payors may take, or whether they will limit the access and level of reimbursement for our products or refuse to provide any approvals or coverage. From time to time, third party payors have refused to provide reimbursement for our products, and others may do so in the future.\nThird party payors increasingly examine the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to their safety and efficacy, when making coverage and reimbursement decisions. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic and/or clinical studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. If our competitors offer their products at prices that provide purportedly lower treatment costs than our products, or otherwise suggest that their products are safer, more effective or more cost-effective than our products, this may result in a greater level of access for their products relative to our products, which would reduce our sales and harm our results of operations. In some cases, for example, third party payors try to encourage the use of less expensive generic products through their prescription benefits coverage and reimbursement and co-pay policies. Because some of our products compete in a market with both branded and generic products, obtaining and maintaining access and reimbursement coverage for our products may be more challenging than for products that are new chemical entities for which no therapeutic alternatives exist.\nThird party pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, and payors can limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication, and to exclude drugs from their formularies in favor of competitor drugs or alternative treatments, or place drugs on formulary tiers with higher patient co-pay obligations, and/or to mandate stricter utilization criteria. Formulary exclusion effectively encourages patients and providers to seek alternative treatments, make a complex and time-intensive request for medical exemptions, or pay 100% of the cost of a drug. In addition, in many instances, certain PBMs and third party payors may exert negotiating leverage by requiring incremental rebates, discounts or other concessions from manufacturers in order to maintain formulary positions, which could result in higher gross to net deductions for affected products. In this regard, we have started to enter into agreements with PBMs and payor accounts regarding formulary coverage for Xyrem and Sunosi, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to agree to coverage terms with other PBMs and other third party payors.\nPayors could decide to exclude Sunosi from formulary coverage lists, impose step edits that require patients to try alternative, including generic, treatments before authorizing payment for Sunosi, limit the types of diagnoses for which coverage will be provided or impose a moratorium on coverage for products while the payor makes a coverage decision. An inability to obtain or maintain adequate formulary positions could increase patient cost-sharing for Sunosi and cause some patients to determine not to use Sunosi. Any delays or unforeseen difficulties in obtaining access or reimbursement approvals could limit patient access, depress therapy adherence rates, and adversely impact our ability to successfully launch Sunosi. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining broad coverage for Sunosi, our anticipated revenue from and growth prospects for Sunosi could be negatively affected. We anticipate similar payor coverage risks with respect to JZP-258, if approved.\nIn many countries outside the U.S., procedures to obtain price approvals, coverage and reimbursement can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval. Many European countries periodically review their reimbursement of medicinal products, which could have an adverse impact on reimbursement status. In addition, we expect that legislators, policymakers and healthcare insurance funds in the EU member states will continue to propose and implement cost-containing measures, such as lower maximum prices, lower or lack of reimbursement coverage and incentives to use cheaper, usually\ngeneric, products as an alternative to branded products, to keep healthcare costs down. Moreover, in order to obtain reimbursement for our products in some European countries, including some EU member states, we may be required to compile additional data comparing the cost-effectiveness of our products to other available therapies. If we are unable to maintain favorable pricing and reimbursement approvals in EU member states that represent significant markets, our anticipated revenue from and growth prospects for our products in the EU could be negatively affected. For example, the EC granted marketing authorization for Vyxeos in August 2018 and for Sunosi in January 2020, and, as part of our rolling launches of Vyxeos and Sunosi in Europe, we are making pricing and reimbursement submissions in European countries. If we experience setbacks or unforeseen difficulties in obtaining favorable pricing and reimbursement approvals, planned launches in the affected EU member states would be delayed, which could negatively impact anticipated revenue from and growth prospects for Vyxeos and/or Sunosi.\nThe pricing of pharmaceutical products has come under increasing scrutiny as part of a global trend toward healthcare cost containment and resulting changes in healthcare law and policy may impact our business in ways that we cannot currently predict, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the U.S. to fundamental changes, particularly given the current atmosphere of mounting criticism of prescription drug costs in the U.S. We expect there will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. For example, we anticipate that the U.S. Congress, state legislatures, and regulators may adopt or accelerate adoption of new healthcare policies and reforms intended to curb healthcare costs, such as federal and state controls on government-funded reimbursement for drugs (including Medicare, Medicaid) and commercial health plans, new or increased requirements to pay prescription drug rebates and penalties to government health care programs, and additional pharmaceutical cost transparency bills that aim to require drug companies to justify their prices through required disclosures. Additionally, proposals made part of proposed legislation and executive rule-making seek to utilize an \u201cinternational pricing index\u201d as a benchmark to determine the costs and potentially limit the reimbursement of drugs under Medicare Part B to more closely align with international drug prices. If the U.S. were to move to such a pricing system that were to apply to any of our products, our revenues from U.S. sales of such products could decrease.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals that have recently been considered include the potential authorization of prescription drug importation from other countries, legislative proposals to limit the terms of patent litigation settlements with generic sponsors, and proposals to define certain conduct around patenting and new product development as unfair competition. All such considerations may adversely affect our business and industry in ways that we cannot accurately predict.\nThere is also ongoing activity related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, together, the Healthcare Reform Act. The Healthcare Reform Act has substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. These changes have impacted previously existing government healthcare programs and have resulted in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment-for-performance initiatives. Some of the provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act have yet to be fully implemented, and certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges, as well as efforts by the current presidential administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Healthcare Reform Act and to alter the implementation of the Healthcare Reform Act and related laws. We expect that the Healthcare Reform Act and its implementation, efforts to repeal or replace, or invalidate, the Healthcare Reform Act or portions thereof and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of our products.\nIf healthcare policies or reforms intended to curb healthcare costs are adopted or if we experience negative publicity with respect to pricing of our products or the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs generally, the prices that we charge for our products, including Xyrem, may be affected, our commercial opportunity may be limited and/or our revenues from sales of our products may be negatively impacted. We have periodically increased the price of Xyrem, most recently in January 2020, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to make similar price adjustments in the future or that price adjustments we have taken or may take in the future will not negatively affect Xyrem sales volumes and revenues from Xyrem. We also have made and may in the future make similar price increases on our other products. There is no guarantee that such price increases will not negatively affect our reputation and our ability to secure and maintain reimbursement coverage for our products, which could limit the prices that we charge for our products, including Xyrem, limit the commercial opportunities for our products and/or negatively impact revenues from sales of our products.\nIf we become the subject of any future government investigation or U.S. Congressional hearing with respect to drug pricing or other business practices, we could incur significant expense and could be distracted from operation of our business and execution of our strategy. Any such investigation or hearing could also result in reduced market acceptance and demand for our products, could harm our reputation and our ability to market our products in the future, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe expect that legislators, policymakers and healthcare insurance funds in Europe will continue to propose and implement cost-containing measures to keep healthcare costs down. These measures could include limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for our products or the level of reimbursement available for these products from governmental authorities or third party payors. Further, an increasing number of European and other foreign countries use prices for medicinal products established in other countries as \u201creference prices\u201d to help determine the price of the product in their own territory. Consequently, a downward trend in prices of medicinal products in some countries could contribute to similar downward trends elsewhere.\nIn addition to access, coverage and reimbursement, the commercial success of our products depends upon their market acceptance by physicians, patients, third party payors and the medical community.\nIf physicians do not prescribe our products, we cannot generate the revenues we anticipate from product sales. Market acceptance of each of our products by physicians, patients, third party payors and the medical community depends on:\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which a product is approved and any restrictions placed upon the product in connection with its approval, such as a REMS, patient registry requirements or labeling restrictions;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence of the disease or condition for which the product is approved and its diagnosis;\n\u2022\nthe severity of side effects and other risks in relation to the benefits of our products;\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians and patients of each product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022\navailability of sufficient product inventory to meet demand, particularly with respect to Erwinaze;\n\u2022\nphysicians\u2019 decisions relating to treatment practices based on availability of product, particularly with respect to Erwinaze;\n\u2022\nperceived advantages over alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nwith respect to Xyrem, physician and patient assessment of the burdens associated with obtaining or maintaining the certifications required under the Xyrem REMS;\n\u2022\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments, including generic products; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of financial or other assistance for patients who are uninsured or underinsured.\nBecause of our dependence upon market acceptance of our products, any adverse publicity associated with harm to patients or other adverse events resulting from the use or misuse of any of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies, including generic versions of our products, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. For example, from time to time, there is negative publicity about illicit GHB and its effects, including with respect to illegal use, overdoses, serious injury and death. Because sodium oxybate, the API in Xyrem, is a derivative of GHB, Xyrem sometimes also receives negative mention in publicity relating to GHB. JZP-258 includes the same API as Xyrem, but uses a different mixture of salts. Patients, physicians and regulators may therefore view Xyrem or JZP 258, if approved, as the same as or similar to illicit GHB. In addition, there are regulators and some law enforcement agencies that oppose the prescription and use of Xyrem, and potentially other oxybate products generally because of their connection to GHB. Xyrem\u2019s label includes information about adverse events from GHB.\nDelays or problems in the supply of our products for sale or for use in clinical trials, loss of our single source suppliers or failure to comply with manufacturing regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of process controls required to consistently produce the API and the finished product in sufficient quantities while meeting detailed product specifications on a repeated basis. We and our suppliers may encounter difficulties in production, including difficulties with production costs and yields, process controls, quality control and quality assurance, including testing of stability, impurities and impurity levels and other product specifications by validated test methods, and compliance with strictly enforced U.S., state and non-U.S. regulations. In addition, we and our suppliers are subject to the FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements, DEA regulations and equivalent rules and regulations prescribed by non-U.S. regulatory authorities. If we or any of our suppliers encounter manufacturing, quality or compliance difficulties with respect to any of our products, we may be unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or meet commercial demand for such products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, we could be subject to enforcement action by regulatory authorities for our failure to comply with cGMP with respect to the products we manufacture in our facilities as well as for our failure to adequately oversee compliance with cGMP by any of our third party suppliers operating under contract. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements subjects us and our suppliers to possible regulatory action, including restrictions on supply or shutdown, which may adversely affect our or a supplier\u2019s ability to supply the ingredients or finished products we need.\nWe have a manufacturing and development facility in Ireland where we manufacture Xyrem and development-stage oxybate products, including JZP-258, and a manufacturing plant in Italy where we produce the defibrotide drug substance. We currently do not have our own commercial manufacturing or packaging capability for our other products, product candidates or\ntheir APIs. As a result, our ability to develop and supply products in a timely and competitive manner depends primarily on third party suppliers being able to meet our ongoing commercial and clinical trial needs for API, other raw materials, packaging materials and finished products.\nIn part due to the limited market size for our products and product candidates, we have a single source of supply for most of our marketed products, product candidates and their APIs. Single sourcing puts us at risk of interruption in supply in the event of manufacturing, quality or compliance difficulties. If one of our suppliers fails or refuses to supply us for any reason, it would take a significant amount of time and expense to implement and execute the necessary technology transfer to, and to qualify, a new supplier. The FDA and similar international or national regulatory bodies must approve manufacturers of the active and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients and certain packaging materials used in our products. If there are delays in qualifying new suppliers or facilities or a new supplier is unable to meet FDA\u2019s or similar international regulatory body\u2019s requirements for approval, there could be a shortage of the affected products for the marketplace or for use in clinical studies, or both, which could negatively impact our anticipated revenues and could potentially cause us to breach contractual obligations with customers or to violate local laws requiring us to deliver the product to those in need.\nErwinaze is licensed from, and manufactured for us by, a single source, PBL. A continuing and significant challenge to maintaining sales of Erwinaze and a barrier to increasing sales is PBL\u2019s inability to consistently supply product that meets specifications in quantities that are adequate to meet market demand. All Erwinaze that PBL has been able to supply is currently completely absorbed by demand for the product, and erratic supply patterns have prevented us from meeting patient demand in some markets or from being able to expand to new markets or indications. As a consequence, there is no product inventory that can be used to absorb supply disruptions resulting from quality, manufacturing, regulatory or other issues. PBL has experienced and continues to experience product quality and manufacturing issues that have resulted, and continue to result, in disruptions in our ability to supply markets from time to time and have caused, and may in the future cause, us to implement batch-specific, modified product use instructions. We experienced limited product availability of Erwinaze and supply disruptions globally in 2019 and may experience continued supply disruptions in 2020. In addition, the FDA has issued a warning letter and FDA Forms 483 to PBL citing, among other things, significant violations of cGMP for finished pharmaceuticals and significant deviations from cGMP for APIs. We cannot predict whether the required remediation activities by PBL in connection with its prior warning letter and FDA Forms 483 will further strain PBL\u2019s manufacturing capacity or otherwise further adversely affect Erwinaze supply.\nAs capacity constraints and supply disruptions continue, whether as a result of continued quality or manufacturing challenges at PBL, regulatory issues or an inability to enforce our contractual rights, we will be unable to build product inventory, our ability to supply the market will continue to be compromised and physicians\u2019 decisions to use Erwinaze will continue to be negatively impacted. In addition, any inability to comply with regulatory requirements of the FDA, the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, or other competent authorities in the EU member states in which Erwinaze is subject to marketing authorizations, including any failure by PBL to correct the violations and deviations referenced above to the satisfaction of the FDA, or failure to meet regulatory specifications for the product, could further adversely affect Erwinaze supply, particularly in light of the historical limitations on the supply of Erwinaze, and could result in enforcement actions by the FDA, the MHRA or other EU member states\u2019 competent authorities (including the issuance of the local equivalents of FDA Form 483s or warning letters), the approval of the FDA or other competent authorities being suspended, varied, or revoked, product release being delayed or suspended, including potentially the FDA refusing admission of Erwinaze in the U.S., or product being seized or recalled. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our sales of, and revenues from, Erwinaze and further limit our future maintenance and potential growth of the market for this product.\nVyxeos is manufactured by Baxter Oncology GmbH, or Baxter, which is a sole source supplier from a single site location. Baxter has experienced batch failures due to mechanical, component and other issues in the production of Vyxeos, and batches have been produced that have otherwise not been in compliance with applicable specifications. We are continuing to work with Baxter to address manufacturing complexities related to Vyxeos. Moreover, the proprietary technology that supports the manufacture of Vyxeos is not easily transferable. Consequently, engaging an alternate manufacturer may be difficult, costly and time-consuming. If we fail to obtain a sufficient supply of Vyxeos in accordance with applicable specifications on a timely basis, our sales of and revenues from Vyxeos, our future maintenance and potential growth of the market for this product, our ability to conduct ongoing and future clinical trials of Vyxeos, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected. In addition, while the APIs in Vyxeos, daunorubicin and cytarabine, are available from a number of suppliers, certain suppliers have received warning letters from the FDA. As a result, we have qualified other suppliers for each API, and we provided the qualification data to the FDA. If the FDA restricts importation of API from either supplier, and we are unable to qualify API from additional suppliers in a timely manner, or at all, our ability to successfully commercialize Vyxeos and generate sales of this product at the level we expect and to conduct ongoing and future clinical trials of Vyxeos could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, in order to conduct our ongoing and any future clinical trials of, complete marketing authorization submissions for, and potentially launch our other product candidates, we also need to have sufficient quantities of product manufactured. Moreover, to obtain approval from the FDA or a similar international or national regulatory body of any product candidate, we or our suppliers for that product must obtain approval by the applicable regulatory body to manufacture and supply product, in some cases based on qualification data provided to the applicable body as part of our regulatory submission. Any delay in generating, or failure to generate, data required in connection with submission of the chemistry, manufacturing and controls portions of any regulatory submission could negatively impact our ability to meet our anticipated submission dates, and therefore our anticipated timing for obtaining FDA or similar international or national regulatory body approval, or our ability to obtain regulatory approval at all. In addition, any failure of us or a supplier to obtain approval by the applicable regulatory body to manufacture and supply product or any delay in receiving, or failure to receive, adequate supplies of a product on a timely basis or in accordance with applicable specifications could negatively impact our ability to successfully launch and commercialize products and generate sales of products at the levels we expect.\nRisks Related to Growth of Our Product Portfolio and Research and Development\nOur future success depends on our ability to successfully develop and obtain and maintain regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe for our late-stage product candidates and, if approved, to successfully launch and commercialize those product candidates.\nThe testing, manufacturing and marketing of our products require regulatory approvals, including approval from the FDA and similar bodies in Europe and other countries. Obtaining marketing approval is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process and approval is never assured. Our inability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our product candidates in the U.S. and Europe and to successfully commercialize new products that are approved would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIn January 2020, we submitted to the FDA our NDA for JZP-258. Delay or failure in obtaining approval of JZP-258 could have a negative impact on our ability to recoup our research and development costs and to successfully commercialize JZP-258, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In December 2019, Pharma Mar, S.A., the company from whom we obtained exclusive U.S. development and commercialization rights to lurbinectedin, submitted an NDA to the FDA in December 2019 for accelerated approval of lurbinectedin for relapsed small cell lung cancer, and in February 2020, the FDA accepted the NDA for filing with priority review. Delay or failure in obtaining approval of lurbinectedin could have a negative impact on our ability to receive a return on our investment in that product candidate and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe are pursuing activities related to the development of improved asparaginase products for patients with ALL or other hematological malignancies. Several of our external research and development collaborations are focused on these efforts, including our agreement with Pfenex, Inc., or Pfenex. Among the product candidates in collaboration with Pfenex is JZP-458, a recombinant Erwinia asparaginase product candidate, for the potential treatment of ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma who have hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase. We also have clinical development efforts focused on expanding the potential of Defitelio, Vyxeos and Sunosi, as well as clinical development efforts focused on JZP-385 for the treatment of essential tremor. Because combination regimens and the continual generation of new data have become particularly important in AML, if we are unable to initiate multiple combination studies, safely combine Vyxeos with novel agents, or if efficacy results do not meet clinicians\u2019 expectations, our growth prospects could be materially adversely affected. If we are not successful in the clinical development of our product candidates, if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in a timely manner, or at all, or if sales of an approved product do not reach the levels we expect, our anticipated revenue from our product candidates would be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe may not be able to successfully identify and acquire or in-license additional products or product candidates to grow our business, and, even if we are able to do so, we may otherwise fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions.\nIn addition to continued investment in our research and development pipeline, we intend to grow our business by acquiring or in-licensing, and developing, including with collaboration partners, additional products and product candidates that we believe are highly differentiated and have significant commercial potential. However, we may be unable to identify or consummate suitable acquisition or in-licensing opportunities, and this inability could impair our ability to grow our business. Other companies, many of which may have substantially greater financial, sales and marketing resources, compete with us for these opportunities. Even if appropriate opportunities are available, we may not be able to successfully identify them, or we may not have the financial resources necessary to pursue them.\nEven if we are able to successfully identify and acquire, in-license or develop additional products or product candidates, we may not be able to successfully manage the risks associated with integrating any products or product candidates into our portfolio or the risks arising from anticipated and unanticipated problems in connection with an acquisition or in-licensing. Further, while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of potential acquisitions and in-licensing transactions through, among other things, due diligence, there may be risks and liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to discover, that are not disclosed to us, or that we inadequately assess. Any failure in identifying and managing these risks, liabilities and uncertainties effectively, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product and product candidate acquisitions, particularly when the acquisition takes the form of a merger or other business consolidation, have required, and any similar future transactions will also require, significant efforts and expenditures, including with respect to transition and integration activities. We may encounter unexpected difficulties, or incur substantial costs, in connection with potential acquisitions and similar transactions, which include:\n\u2022\nthe need to incur substantial debt or engage in dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay for acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe potential disruption of our historical core business;\n\u2022\nthe strain on, and need to continue to expand, our existing operational, technical, financial and administrative infrastructure;\n\u2022\nthe difficulties in integrating acquired products and product candidates into our portfolio;\n\u2022\nthe difficulties in assimilating employees and corporate cultures;\n\u2022\nthe failure to retain key managers and other personnel;\n\u2022\nthe need to write down assets or recognize impairment charges;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention to integration of operations and corporate and administrative infrastructures; and\n\u2022\nany unanticipated liabilities for activities of or related to the acquired business or its operations, products or product candidates.\nAs a result of these or other factors, products or product candidates we acquire, or obtain licenses to, may not produce the revenues, earnings or business synergies that we anticipated, acquired or in-licensed product candidates may not result in regulatory approvals, and acquired or licensed products may not perform as expected. Failure to manage effectively our growth through acquisitions or in-licensing transactions could adversely affect our growth prospects, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nConducting clinical trials is costly and time-consuming, and the outcomes are uncertain. A failure to prove that our product candidates are safe and effective in clinical trials, or to generate data in clinical trials to support expansion of the therapeutic uses for our existing products, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nAs a condition to regulatory approval, each product candidate must undergo extensive and expensive preclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate to a statistically significant degree that the product candidate is safe and effective. The results at any stage of the development process may lack the desired safety, efficacy or pharmacokinetic characteristics. If the FDA determines that the safety or efficacy data submitted for the NDAs for JZP-258 or lurbinectedin, or to be submitted in the planned biologics license application, or BLA, for JZP-458, do not warrant marketing approval, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials, which could be costly and time-consuming. Even if we believe we have successfully completed testing, the FDA or any equivalent non-U.S. regulatory agency may determine our data is not sufficiently compelling to warrant marketing approval for the indications sought, if at all, and may require us to engage in additional clinical trials or provide further analysis which may be costly and time-consuming. Any adverse events or other data generated during the course of clinical trials of our product candidates and/or clinical trials related to additional indications for our commercialized products could result in action by the FDA or a non-U.S. regulatory agency, which may restrict our ability to sell, or adversely affect sales of, currently marketed products, or such events or other data could otherwise have a material adverse effect on a related commercial product, including with respect to its safety profile. Any failure or delay in completing such clinical trials could materially and adversely affect the maintenance and growth of the markets for the related marketed products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and overall growth prospects.\nIn addition to issues relating to the results generated in clinical trials, clinical trials can be delayed or halted for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulty identifying, recruiting or enrolling eligible patients, often based on the number of clinical trials, particularly in hematology and oncology, with enrollment criteria targeting the same patient population;\n\u2022\ndifficulty identifying a clinical development pathway, including viable indications and appropriate clinical trial protocol design, particularly where there is no applicable regulatory precedent;\n\u2022\ndelays or failures in obtaining regulatory authorization to commence a trial because of safety concerns of regulators relating to our product candidates or similar product candidates of our competitors or failure to follow regulatory guidelines;\n\u2022\ndelays or failures in obtaining clinical materials and manufacturing sufficient quantities of the product candidate for use in trials;\n\u2022\ndelays or failures in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective study sites;\n\u2022\ndelays or failures in obtaining approval of our clinical trial protocol from an institutional review board, known as an ethics committee in Europe, to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective study site;\n\u2022\nfailure of our clinical trials and clinical investigators, including contract research organizations or other third parties assisting us with clinical trials, to satisfactorily perform their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines and comply with the FDA and other regulatory agencies\u2019 requirements, including good clinical practices;\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety issues;\n\u2022\ninability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment;\n\u2022\ndifficulty monitoring multiple study sites; or\n\u2022\ninsufficient funds to complete the trials.\nThe regulatory approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent us or our partners from obtaining and maintaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates.\nWe are not permitted to market a pharmaceutical product in the U.S. or in the EU member states until we receive approval from the FDA or a marketing authorization from the EC or the competent authorities of the EU member states, as applicable. If the FDA, the EC or the competent authorities of the EU member states determine that our quality, safety or efficacy data do not warrant marketing approval for a product candidate such as JZP-258, we could be required to conduct additional clinical trials as a condition to receiving approval, which could be costly and time-consuming and could delay or preclude the approval of our application. Any delay or failure in obtaining approval of a product candidate, our receipt of approval for narrower indications than sought, or burdens in an approved label such as a boxed warning, could have a negative impact on our ability to recoup our research and development costs and to successfully commercialize that product, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIn May 2018, we purchased a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher for $110.0 million, which we redeemed in connection with the submission of our NDA for JZP-258 in January 2020. However, the redemption of our rare pediatric disease priority review voucher may not result in faster review or approval for JZP-258 compared to products considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and, in any event, does not assure ultimate approval of JZP-258 by FDA. For example, the FDA could determine that our application is not sufficient to support approval with the label we have requested, and require amendments or additional data, which could delay or preclude the approval of our NDA.\nEven if we receive approval of a product, regulatory authorities may impose significant labeling restrictions or requirements, including limitations on the dosing of the product, requirements around the naming or strength of a product, restrictions on indicated uses for which we may market the product, the imposition of a boxed warning or other warnings and precautions, and/or the requirement for a REMS to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. The FDA requires a REMS and a boxed warning for Xyrem, and similar restrictions could be imposed on other products in the future. For example, we expect that the FDA will require a REMS for approval of JZP-258. Regulatory authorities may also impose post-marketing obligations as part of their approval, which may lead to additional costs and burdens associated with commercialization of the drug, and may pose a risk to maintaining approval of the drug. We are subject to certain post-marketing requirements and commitments in connection with the approval of certain of our products, including Defitelio, Erwinaze, Vyxeos and Sunosi. These post-marketing requirements and commitments include satisfactorily conducting multiple post-marketing clinical trials and safety studies. In the event that we are unable to comply with our post-marketing obligations imposed as part of the marketing approvals in the U.S. or EU, our approval may be varied, suspended or revoked, product supply may be delayed and our sales of and revenues from our products could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\nOur commercial success depends in part on obtaining, maintaining and defending intellectual property protection for our products and product candidates, including protection of their use and methods of manufacturing and distribution. Our ability to protect our products and product candidates from unauthorized making, using, selling, offering to sell or importation by third parties depends on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or have adequately protected trade secrets that cover these activities.\nThe degree of protection to be afforded by our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022\nour patent applications, or those of our licensors or partners, may not result in issued patents;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or therapeutically equivalent products without infringing our patents, or those of our licensors, such as products that are not covered by the claims of our patents, or for which we do not have adequate exclusive rights under our license agreements;\n\u2022\nour issued patents, or those of our licensors or partners, may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges by third parties or may be vulnerable to legal challenges as a result of changes in applicable law;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors or partners might not have been the first to invent or file, as appropriate, subject matters covered by our issued patents or pending patent applications or those of our licensors or partners;\n\u2022\ncompetitors may manufacture products in countries where we have not applied for patent protection or that have a different scope of patent protection or that do not respect our patents; or\n\u2022\nothers may be issued patents that prevent the sale of our products or require licensing and the payment of significant fees or royalties.\nPatent enforcement generally must be sought on a country-by-country basis, and issues of patent validity and infringement may be judged differently in different countries. For example, in the EU, approval of a generic pharmaceutical product can occur independently of whether the reference brand product is covered by patents, and enforcement of such patents generally must await approval and an indication that the generic product is being offered for sale.\nChanges in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property portfolio. Even if we are able to obtain patents covering our products and product candidates, any patent may be challenged, and potentially invalidated or held unenforceable, including through patent litigation or through patent office procedures that permit challenges to patent validity. Patents can also be circumvented, potentially including by FDA approval of an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application that avoids infringement of our intellectual property.\nWe have settled patent litigation with nine companies seeking to introduce generic versions of Xyrem in the U.S. by granting those companies licenses to launch their generic products (and in certain cases, an authorized generic version of Xyrem) in advance of the expiration of the last of our patents. Notwithstanding our Xyrem patents and settlement agreements, additional third parties may also attempt to introduce generic versions of Xyrem or other sodium oxybate products for treatment of cataplexy and/or EDS in narcolepsy that design around our patents or assert that our patents are invalid or otherwise unenforceable. Such third parties could launch a generic or 505(b)(2) product referencing Xyrem before the dates provided in our patents or settlement agreements. For example, we have several method of use patents listed in the FDA\u2019s publication \u201cApproved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,\u201d or the Orange Book, that expire in 2033 that cover treatment methods included in the Xyrem label related to a drug-drug interaction, or DDI, with divalproex sodium. Although the FDA has stated, in granting a Citizen Petition we submitted in 2016, that it would not approve any sodium oxybate ANDA referencing Xyrem that does not include the portions of the currently approved Xyrem label related to the DDI patents, we cannot predict whether a future ANDA filer, or a company that files a Section 505(b)(2) application for a drug referencing Xyrem, may pursue regulatory strategies to avoid infringing our DDI patents notwithstanding the FDA\u2019s response to the Citizen Petition, or whether any such strategy would be successful. Likewise, we cannot predict whether we will be able to maintain the validity of these patents or will otherwise obtain a judicial determination that a generic or other sodium oxybate product, its package insert or the generic sodium oxybate REMS or another separate REMS will infringe any of our patents or, if we prevail in proving infringement, whether a court will grant an injunction that prevents a future ANDA filer or other company introducing a different sodium oxybate product from marketing its product, or instead require that party to pay damages in the form of lost profits or a reasonable royalty.\nSince Xyrem\u2019s regulatory exclusivity has expired in the EU, we are aware that generic or hybrid generic applications have been approved by various EU regulatory authorities, and additional generic or hybrid generic applications may be submitted and approved. We cannot predict whether our licensee in the EU will be able to enforce our existing European patents against generic or hybrid generic filers in the EU.\nWe also currently rely on trade secret protection for several of our products, including Erwinaze and Defitelio. Trade secret protection does not protect information or inventions if another party develops that information or invention independently, and establishing that a competitor developed a product through trade secret misappropriation rather than through legitimate means may be difficult to prove. Trade secret protection also requires that information be secret and subject to reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy, and this requirement may come into conflict with requirements to provide information to employees, consultants, business partners, and regulatory bodies. We seek to protect our trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information in part through confidentiality and invention agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and partners. Nevertheless, our employees, consultants, advisors and partners may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information to competitors, and we may not have adequate remedies for such disclosures. Moreover, if a dispute arises with our employees, consultants, advisors or partners over the ownership of rights to inventions, including jointly developed intellectual property, we could lose patent protection or the confidentiality of our proprietary information, and possibly also lose the ability to pursue the development of certain new products or product candidates.\nIn some instances, we also rely on regulatory exclusivity to protect our commercial position. For example, Erwinaze was granted orphan drug exclusivity by the FDA for the treatment of ALL in the U.S. for a seven-year period from its FDA approval, which had precluded approval of another product with the same principal molecular structure for the same indication until November 2018. As a biologic product approved under a BLA, Erwinaze is also subject to the U.S. Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, and accordingly should be protected by exclusivity that prevents approval of a biosimilar in the U.S. through late 2023 under the BPCIA. However, interpretation of regulatory exclusivity under the BPCIA may evolve over time based on FDA issuance of guidance documents, proposed regulations or decisions made by the FDA in the course of considering specific applications. In addition, the BPCIA exclusivity period does not prevent another company from independently developing a product that is highly similar to Erwinaze, generating all the data necessary for a full BLA and seeking approval. As a result, it is possible that a potential competing drug product might obtain FDA approval before the expected BPCIA exclusivity period has expired, which would adversely affect our sales of Erwinaze if we are able to maintain our marketing rights to that product. In the EU, the regulatory data protection that provides an exclusivity period for Erwinase has lapsed. Any new marketing authorizations for Erwinase in other EU member states will not receive any regulatory data protection. If a biosimilar product to Erwinaze is approved as interchangeable to Erwinaze in the U.S. or in other countries where Erwinaze is sold, a significant percentage of the prescriptions that could be filled by Erwinaze, if commercially available, may be filled with the biosimilar version, resulting in a loss in sales of Erwinaze, and there may be a decrease in the price at which Erwinaze can be sold. Competition from a biosimilar product to Erwinaze could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe have incurred and may in the future incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patents, other intellectual property rights and related matters, and we may be unable to protect our rights to, or commercialize, our products.\nOur ability, and that of our partners, to commercialize any approved products will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, enforce those patents and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. If we choose to go to court to stop a third party from infringing our patents, our licensed patents or our partners\u2019 patents, that third party has the right to ask the court or an administrative agency to rule that these patents are invalid and/or should not be enforced. These lawsuits and administrative proceedings are expensive and consume time and other resources, and we may not be successful in these proceedings or in stopping infringement. In addition, the inter partes review, or IPR, process under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act permits any person, whether they are accused of infringing the patent at issue or not, to challenge the validity of certain patents through a proceeding before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, or PTAB, of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\nThere is a risk that a court or the PTAB could decide that our patents or certain claims in our patents are not valid or infringed, and that we do not have the right to stop a third party from using the inventions covered by those claims, as happened with six of our patents covering the Xyrem REMS, which were invalidated through the IPR process and delisted from the Orange Book. In addition, even if we prevail in establishing that another product infringes a valid claim of one of our patents, a court may determine that we can be compensated for the infringement in damages, and refuse to issue an injunction. As a result, we may not be entitled to stop another party from infringing our patents for their full term.\nLitigation involving patent matters is frequently settled between the parties, rather than continuing to a court ruling, and we have settled patent litigation with all nine Xyrem ANDA filers. The FTC has publicly stated that, in its view, certain types of agreements between branded and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the settlement of patent litigation or the manufacture, marketing and sale of generic versions of branded drugs violate the antitrust laws and has commenced investigations and brought actions against some companies that have entered into such agreements. In particular, the FTC has expressed its intention to take aggressive action to challenge settlements that include an alleged transfer of value from the brand company to the generic company (so-called \u201cpay for delay\u201d patent litigation settlements). The U.S. Congress and state legislatures have also identified pharmaceutical patent settlements as potential impediments to generic competition and have introduced, and in states like California passed, legislation to regulate them. Third party payors have also challenged such settlements on the grounds that they increase drug prices. Because there is currently no precise legal standard with respect to the lawfulness of such settlements, there could be extensive litigation over whether any settlement that we have entered into or might enter into in the future constitutes a reasonable and lawful patent settlement. Parties to such settlement agreements in the U.S. are required by law to file the agreements with the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, for review. Accordingly, we have submitted our ANDA litigation settlement agreements to the FTC and the DOJ for review. We may receive formal or informal requests from the FTC regarding our ANDA litigation settlements, and there is a risk that the FTC may commence a formal investigation or action against us, or a third party may initiate civil litigation regarding such settlements, which could divert the attention of management and cause us to incur significant costs, regardless of the outcome. Any claim or finding that we or our business partners have failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations could be costly to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nA third party may claim that we or our manufacturing or commercialization partners are using inventions covered by the third party\u2019s patent rights, or that we or such partners are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating other intellectual property rights, and may go to court to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, including making or selling our products. Such lawsuits are costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of management and development personnel. There is a risk that a court could decide that we or our partners are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating third party patent or other intellectual property rights, which could be very costly to us and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent and/or that the patent claims are invalid or unenforceable, which we may not be able to do.\nOther Risks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have substantially expanded our international footprint and operations, and we may expand further in the future, which subjects us to a variety of risks and complexities which, if not effectively managed, could negatively affect our business.\nWe are headquartered in Dublin, Ireland and have multiple offices in the U.S., Canada, the UK, Italy and other countries in Europe. We may further expand our international operations into other countries in the future, either organically or by acquisition. Conducting our business in multiple countries subjects us to a variety of risks and complexities that may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects, including:\n\u2022\nthe diverse regulatory, financial and legal requirements in the countries where we are located or do business, and any changes to those requirements;\n\u2022\nchallenges inherent in efficiently managing employees in diverse geographies, including the need to adapt systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs to differing labor and employment law and other regulations, as well as maintaining positive interactions with our unionized employees;\n\u2022\ncosts of, and liabilities for, our international operations, products or product candidates; and\n\u2022\npublic health risks, such as the recent spread in China of coronavirus in early 2020 and potential related effects on supply chain, travel and employee health and availability.\nIn addition, there can be no guarantee that we will effectively manage the increasing, global complexity of our business without experiencing operating inefficiencies or control deficiencies. Our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, could increase our cost of doing business, reduce our gross margins or otherwise negatively impact our business and our financial results.\nBrexit will continue to create significant uncertainty concerning the future relationship between the UK and the EU, particularly if the recent UK withdrawal from the EU in January 2020 is followed by a failure to agree to a future trading relationship between the EU and the UK. Since a significant portion of the regulatory framework in the UK is derived from EU laws, Brexit could materially impact the regulatory regime with respect to the development, manufacture, importation, approval and commercialization of our product candidates in the UK or the EU. For example, there is a risk that the scope of a marketing authorization for a medicinal product granted by the EC or by the competent authorities of EU member states will not encompass the UK. In these circumstances, a separate authorization granted by the UK competent authorities will be required to place medicinal products on the UK market. In addition, our ability to rely on UK manufacturing sites for products intended for the EU market will depend on the terms of the trade agreements concluded between the EU and the UK in the coming months and, potentially, on the ability to obtain relevant exemptions under EU law to supply the EU market with products manufactured at UK-certified sites. There is also the risk that if batch release and quality control testing sites for our products are located only in the UK, manufacturers will need to use sites in other EU member states to manufacture products for supply to the EU market. All of these changes, if they occur, could increase our costs and otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, currency exchange rates for the British Pound and the euro with respect to each other and to the U.S. dollar have already been, and may be continue to be, negatively affected by Brexit, which could cause volatility in our quarterly financial results.\nWe have an office in Oxford, England, which is focused on commercialization of our products outside of the U.S. We do not know to what extent, or when, the UK\u2019s recent withdrawal from the EU will impact our business, particularly our ability to conduct international business from a base of operations in the UK. The UK could lose the benefits of global trade agreements negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members, possibly resulting in increased trade barriers, which could make doing business in Europe more difficult and/or costly. Moreover, in the U.S., tariffs on certain U.S. imports have recently been imposed, and the EU and other countries have responded with retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. exports. We cannot predict what effects these and potential additional tariffs will have on our business, including in the context of escalating global trade and political tensions. However, these tariffs and other trade restrictions, whether resulting from the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU or\notherwise, could increase our cost of doing business, reduce our gross margins or otherwise negatively impact our business and our financial results.\nIf we fail to attract, retain and motivate key personnel or to retain the members of our executive management team, our operations and our future growth may be adversely affected.\nOur success and our ability to grow depend in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel, including our executive management team. We do not carry \u201ckey person\u201d insurance. The loss of services and institutional knowledge of one or more additional members of our executive management team or other key personnel could delay or prevent the successful completion of some of our vital activities and may negatively impact our operations and future growth. In addition, changes in our organization as a result of executive management transition may have a disruptive impact on our ability to implement our strategy. Until we integrate new personnel, and unless they are able to succeed in their positions, we may be unable to successfully manage and grow our business. In any event, if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate quality individuals, or if there are delays, or if we do not successfully manage personnel and executive management transitions, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or data security breaches could adversely affect our business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, process and transmit large amounts of confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information. We have also outsourced some of our operations (including parts of our information technology infrastructure) to a number of third party vendors who may have, or could gain, access to our confidential information. In addition, many of those third parties, in turn, subcontract or outsource some of their responsibilities to third parties.\nOur information technology systems, and those of our vendors, are large and complex and store large amounts of confidential information. The size and complexity of these systems make them potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third party vendors and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties. Attacks of this nature are increasing in frequency, persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage) and expertise, including organized criminal groups, \u201chacktivists,\u201d nation states and others. In addition to the extraction of important information, such attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information. Although the aggregate impact on our operations and financial condition has not been material to date, we and our vendors have been the target of events of this nature and expect them to continue.\nSignificant disruptions of our, our third party vendors\u2019 and/or business partners\u2019 information technology systems or security breaches could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss, misappropriation, and/or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, confidential information (including trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information), and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. Any such event that leads to unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our patients or employees, could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information, which could disrupt our business, result in increased costs or loss of revenue, and/or result in significant legal and financial exposure. In addition, security breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may further harm us. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices to access confidential information increases the risk of security breaches. While we have implemented security measures to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent service interruptions or security breaches that could adversely affect our business. In addition, failure to maintain effective internal accounting controls related to security breaches and cybersecurity in general could impact our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements and subject us to regulatory scrutiny.\nWe are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight, which may result in significant additional expense and limit our ability to commercialize our products.\nFDA and Equivalent Non-U.S. Regulatory Authorities\nOur activities are subject to extensive regulation encompassing the entire life cycle of our products, from research and development activities to marketing approval (including specific post-marketing obligations), manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event and safety reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, sale, pricing and reimbursement, recordkeeping, distribution, importing and exporting. The failure by us or any of our third party partners, including our corporate development and collaboration partners, clinical trial sites, suppliers, distributors and our central pharmacy for Xyrem, to comply with\napplicable requirements could subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions or other negative consequences, such as delays in approval or refusal to approve a product candidate, restrictions on our products, our suppliers, our other partners or us, the withdrawal, suspension or variation of product approval or manufacturing authorizations, untitled letters, warning letters, fines and other monetary penalties, unanticipated expenditures, product recall, withdrawal or seizure, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, interruption of manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution, any of which could result in a significant drop in our revenues from the affected products and harm to our reputation and could have a significant impact on our sales, business and financial condition.\nWe monitor adverse events resulting from the use of our products, as do the regulatory authorities, and we file periodic reports with the authorities concerning adverse events. The authorities review these events and reports, and if they determine that any events and/or reports indicate a trend or signal, they can require a change in a product label, restrict sales and marketing and/or require or conduct other actions, potentially including variation, withdrawal or suspension of the marketing authorization, any of which could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for our products, could harm our reputation and our ability to market our products in the future, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. The FDA and the competent authorities of the EU member states on behalf of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, also periodically inspect our records related to safety reporting. The EMA\u2019s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee may propose to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use that the marketing authorization holder be required to take specific steps or advise that the existing marketing authorization be varied, suspended or revoked. Failure to adequately and promptly correct the observation(s) can result in further regulatory enforcement action, which could include the variation, suspension or withdrawal of marketing authorization or imposition of financial penalties or other enforcement measures.\nErwinaze, defibrotide and Vyxeos are available on a named patient basis or through a compassionate use process in many countries where they are not commercially available. If any such country\u2019s regulatory authorities determine that we are promoting such products without proper authorization, we could be found to be in violation of pharmaceutical advertising laws or the regulations permitting sales under named patient programs. In that case, we may be subject to financial or other penalties. Any failure to maintain revenues from sales of Erwinaze, defibrotide and/or Vyxeos on a named patient basis and/or to generate revenues from commercial sales of these products exceeding historical sales on a named patient basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe FDA, the competent authorities of the EU member states and other governmental authorities require advertising and promotional materials to be truthful and not misleading, and products to be marketed only for their approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Regulatory authorities actively investigate allegations of off-label promotion in order to enforce regulations prohibiting these types of activities. A determination that we have promoted an approved product for off-label uses could subject us to significant liability, including civil and administrative financial penalties and other remedies as well as criminal financial penalties, other sanctions and imprisonment. Even if we are not determined to have engaged in off-label promotion, an allegation that we have engaged in such activities could have a significant impact on our sales, business and financial condition. The U.S. government has also required companies to enter into complex corporate integrity agreements and/or non-prosecution agreements that impose significant reporting and other burdens on the affected companies. Failure to maintain a comprehensive and effective compliance program, and to integrate the operations of acquired businesses into a combined comprehensive and effective compliance program on a timely basis, could subject us to a range of regulatory actions and/or civil or criminal penalties that could affect our ability to commercialize our products and could harm or prevent sales of the affected products, or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing our products.\nOther Regulatory Authorities\nWe are also subject to regulation by other regional, national, state and local agencies, including the DEA, the DOJ, the FTC, the United States Department of Commerce, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, and other regulatory bodies, as well as similar governmental authorities in those non-U.S. countries in which we commercialize our products.\nWe are subject to numerous fraud and abuse laws and regulations globally and our sales, marketing, patient support and medical activities may be subject to scrutiny under these laws and regulations. These laws are described in \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we maintain a comprehensive compliance program to try to ensure that our practices and the activities of our third-party contractors and employees fall within the scope of available statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, regulators and enforcement agencies may disagree with our assessment or find fault with the conduct of our employees or contractors. In addition, existing regulations are subject to regulatory revision or changes in interpretation by the DOJ or OIG.\nMany companies have faced government investigations or lawsuits by whistleblowers who bring a qui tam action under the False Claims Act on behalf of themselves and the government for a variety of alleged improper marketing activities,\nincluding providing free product to customers expecting that the customers would bill federal programs for the product, providing consulting fees, grants, free travel and other benefits to physicians to induce them to prescribe the company\u2019s products, and inflating prices reported to private price publication services, which are used to set drug reimbursement rates under government healthcare programs. In addition, the government and private whistleblowers have pursued False Claims Act cases against pharmaceutical companies for causing false claims to be submitted as a result of the marketing of their products for unapproved uses. If we become the subject of a government False Claims Act or other investigation or whistleblower suit, we could incur substantial legal costs (including settlement costs) and business disruption responding to such investigation or suit, regardless of the outcome.\nPublic reporting under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or Sunshine, provisions and other similar state laws, the requirements of which are discussed in \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has resulted in increased scrutiny of the financial relationships between industry, teaching hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers. Such scrutiny may negatively impact our ability to engage with physicians on matters of importance to us. In addition, government agencies and private entities may inquire about our marketing practices or pursue other enforcement activities based on the disclosures in those public reports. If the data reflected in our reports are found to be in violation of any of the Sunshine provisions or any other U.S. federal, state or local laws or regulations that may apply, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the Sunshine provisions or similar requirements of state or local regulators, we may be subject to significant civil, and administrative penalties, damages or fines.\nWe have various programs to help patients access our products, including patient assistance programs, which include co-pay coupons for certain of our products, assistance to help patients determine their insurance coverage for our products, and a free product program. Co-pay coupon programs for commercially insured patients, including our program for Xyrem, have received negative publicity related to allegations regarding their use to promote branded pharmaceutical products over other less costly alternatives. In the past, payors brought class action lawsuits challenging the legality of manufacturer co-pay programs under a variety of federal and state laws and insurers have taken actions through their network pharmacies and PBMs to restrict manufacturer co-pay programs. In September 2014, the OIG issued a Special Advisory Bulletin warning manufacturers that they may be subject to sanctions under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and other laws if they do not take appropriate steps to exclude Medicare Part D beneficiaries from using co-pay coupons. It is possible that changes in insurer policies regarding co-pay coupons and/or the introduction and enactment of new legislation or regulatory action could restrict or otherwise negatively affect these patient support programs, which could result in fewer patients using affected products, including Xyrem, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our sales, business and financial condition.\nWe have established programs to consider grant applications submitted by independent charitable organizations, including organizations that provide co-pay support to patients who suffer from the diseases treated by our drugs. The OIG has issued guidance for how pharmaceutical manufacturers can lawfully make donations to charitable organizations who provide co-pay assistance to Medicare patients, provided that such organizations, among other things, are bona fide charities, are entirely independent of and not controlled by the manufacturer, provide aid to applicants on a first-come basis according to consistent financial criteria, and do not link aid to use of a donor\u2019s product. Although we have structured our programs to follow available guidance, if we or our vendors or donation recipients are deemed to fail to comply with relevant laws, regulations or evolving government guidance in the operation of these programs, such facts could be used as the basis for an enforcement action against us by the federal government or other enforcement agencies or private litigants.\nIn 2016 and 2017, we received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Massachusetts requesting documents related to our support of charitable organizations that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients. In April 2019, we finalized our civil settlement agreement with the DOJ and OIG, and entered into a corporate integrity agreement requiring us to maintain our ongoing corporate compliance program and obligating us to implement or continue, as applicable, a set of defined corporate integrity activities for a period of five years from the effective date of the corporate integrity agreement. In the event of a breach of the corporate integrity agreement, we could become liable for payment of certain stipulated penalties or could be excluded from participation in federal health care programs, which would have a material adverse effect on our sales, business and financial condition.\nWe may also become subject to similar investigations by other state or federal governmental agencies or offices of our patient assistance programs or other business practices, which could result in damages, fines, penalties or other criminal, civil or administrative sanctions or enforcement actions, as well as negative publicity, reduction in demand for, or patient access to, our products and/or reduce coverage of our products, including by federal and state health care programs. If any or all of these events occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business activities outside of the U.S. are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the UK Bribery Act of 2010, or the UK Bribery Act. In certain countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers may be subject to regulation under the FCPA and the UK Bribery Act. Recently the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission, or SEC, and the DOJ have increased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies. Violation of these laws by us or our suppliers and other third party agents for which we may be liable may result in civil or criminal sanctions, which could include monetary fines, criminal penalties, and disgorgement of past profits, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nOutside the U.S., interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, such as national anti-bribery laws of European countries, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians\u2019 codes of professional conduct. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.\nXyrem and Sunosi are controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act. Our suppliers, distributors, clinical sites and prescribers, as well as retail pharmacies for Sunosi and the central pharmacy for Xyrem, are subject to DEA and state regulations relating to manufacturing, storage, distribution and physician prescription procedures, including limitations on prescription refills, and are required to maintain DEA registration and state licenses, when handling these drugs and their APIs. The DEA periodically inspects facilities for compliance with its rules and regulations. Failure to comply with current and future regulations of the DEA, relevant state authorities or any comparable international requirements could lead to a variety of sanctions, including revocation or denial of renewal of DEA registrations, fines, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties, could result in, among other things, additional operating costs to us or delays in shipments outside or into the U.S. and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe are also subject to data protection and privacy laws and regulations governing the processing of personal data. If we or our third party partners fail to comply with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations, we could be subject to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, criminal and civil liability for us and our officers and directors, private litigation and/or adverse publicity. In addition, our business could be adversely impacted if our ability to transfer personal data outside of the European Economic Area or Switzerland is restricted, which could adversely impact our operating results. In addition, although we are not directly subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HIPAA, other than with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we potentially could be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates or our agents knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.\nIf we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, the 340B program, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program, the Tricare Retail Pharmacy program, and have obligations to report the average sales price for certain of our drugs to the Medicare program. All of these programs are described in more detail under the heading \u201cBusiness-Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement by Government and Private Payors and Patient Access\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPricing and rebate calculations vary across products and programs, are complex, and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts, which can change and evolve over time. In the case of our Medicaid pricing data, if we become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we are obligated to resubmit the corrected data for up to three years after those data originally were due. Such restatements and recalculations increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate program and could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters. Price recalculations also may affect the ceiling price at which we are required to offer our products under the 340B program.\nCivil monetary penalties can be applied if we are found to have knowingly submitted any false price or product information to the government, if we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of our average sales price, if we fail to submit the required price data on a timely basis, or if we are found to have charged 340B covered entities more than the statutorily mandated ceiling price. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, could also decide to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, in which case federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs.\nOur failure to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program and other governmental programs could negatively impact our financial results. CMS issued a final regulation, which became effective on April 1, 2016, to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under the Healthcare Reform Act. The issuance of the final regulation, as well as any other regulations and coverage expansion by various governmental agencies relating to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, has increased and will continue to increase our costs and the complexity of\ncompliance, has been and will continue to be time-consuming to implement, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, particularly if CMS challenges the approach we take in our implementation of the final regulation.\nThe Health Resources and Services Administration, or HRSA, issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities, which became effective on January 1, 2019. Implementation of this regulation could affect our obligations and potential liability under the 340B program in ways we cannot anticipate. We are also required to report the 340B ceiling prices for our covered outpatient drugs to HRSA, which then publishes them to 340B covered entities. Any charge by HRSA that we have violated the requirements of the program or the regulation could negatively impact our financial results. Further, any additional future changes to the definition of average manufacturer price and the Medicaid rebate amount under the Healthcare Reform Act or otherwise could affect our 340B ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe have obligations to report the average sales price for certain of our drugs to the Medicare program. Statutory or regulatory changes or CMS guidance could affect the average sales price calculations for our products and the resulting Medicare payment rate, and could negatively impact our results of operations.\nPursuant to applicable law, knowing provision of false information in connection with price reporting under the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, FSS or Tricare Retail Pharmacy, or Tricare, programs can subject a manufacturer to civil monetary penalties. These program obligations also contain extensive disclosure and certification requirements. If we overcharge the government in connection with our arrangements with FSS or Tricare, we are required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against us under the False Claims Act and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responding to a government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur business and operations could be negatively affected if we become subject to shareholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our business strategy and impact our stock price.\nShareholder activism, which takes many forms and arises in a variety of situations, has been increasingly prevalent. If we become the subject of certain forms of shareholder activism, such as proxy contests, the attention of our management and our board of directors may be diverted from execution of our strategy. Such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future strategy, adversely affect our relationships with business partners and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, we may incur substantial costs, including significant legal fees and other expenses, related to activist shareholder matters. Our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism.\nProduct liability and product recalls could harm our business.\nThe development, manufacture, testing, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products are associated with significant risks of product liability claims or recalls. Side effects or adverse events known or reported to be associated with, or manufacturing defects in, the products sold by us could exacerbate a patient\u2019s condition, or could result in serious injury or impairment or even death. This could result in product liability claims against us and/or recalls of one or more of our products. In many countries, including in EU member states, national laws provide for strict (no-fault) liability which applies even where damages are caused both by a defect in a product and by the act or omission of a third party.\nProduct recalls may be issued at our discretion or at the discretion of our suppliers, government agencies and other entities that have regulatory authority for pharmaceutical sales. Any recall of our products could materially adversely affect our business by rendering us unable to sell that product for some time and by adversely affecting our reputation. A recall could also result in product liability claims by individuals and third party payors. In addition, product liability claims could result in an investigation of the safety or efficacy of our products, our manufacturing processes and facilities, or our marketing programs conducted by the FDA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the EU member states. Such investigations could also potentially lead to a recall of our products or more serious enforcement actions, limitations on the therapeutic indications for which they may be used, or suspension, variation, or withdrawal of approval. Any such regulatory action by the FDA, the EC or the competent authorities of the EU member states could lead to product liability lawsuits as well.\nProduct liability insurance coverage is expensive, can be difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. Our product liability insurance may not cover all of the future liabilities we might incur in connection with the development, manufacture or sale of our products. A successful claim or claims brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage could subject us to significant liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Such claims could also harm our reputation and the reputation of our products, adversely affecting our ability to market our products successfully.\nWe use hazardous materials in our manufacturing facilities, and any claims relating to the improper handling, storage, release or disposal of these materials could be time-consuming and expensive.\nOur operations are subject to complex and increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and, in particular, in Italy and Ireland where we have manufacturing facilities. If an accident or contamination involving pollutants or hazardous substances occurs, an injured party could seek to hold us liable for any damages that result and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our insurance. We may not be able to maintain insurance with sufficient coverage on acceptable terms, or at all. Costs, damages and/or fines may result from the presence, investigation and remediation of such contamination at properties currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by us or at off-site locations, including where we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances or waste. In addition, we may be subject to third party claims, including for natural resource damages, personal injury and property damage, in connection with such contamination.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Results\nWe have incurred substantial debt, which could impair our flexibility and access to capital and adversely affect our financial position, and our business would be adversely affected if we are unable to service our debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had total indebtedness of approximately $1.8 billion. Our substantial indebtedness may:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments or other general business purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry, or our ability to take specified actions to take advantage of certain business opportunities that may be presented to us;\n\u2022\nresult in dilution to our existing shareholders in the event exchanges of our exchangeable senior notes are settled in our ordinary shares;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our debt service obligations. In the absence of such cash flows and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. In addition, if we are unable to repay amounts under our secured credit agreement that we entered into in June 2015 and subsequently amended, which we refer to as the amended credit agreement, the lenders under the amended credit agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt, which would seriously harm our business.\nCovenants in our amended credit agreement restrict our business and operations in many ways and if we do not effectively manage our covenants, our financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe amended credit agreement contains various covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and/or our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022\nincur or assume liens or additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nmake loans, investments, acquisitions (including acquisitions of exclusive licenses) and capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nsell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person.\nThe amended credit agreement also includes certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a maximum secured leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. Our failure to comply with any of the covenants could result in a default under the amended credit agreement, which could permit the lenders to declare all or part of any outstanding borrowings to be immediately due and payable, or to refuse to permit additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility. Moreover, our failure to repurchase our exchangeable senior notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indentures governing our exchangeable senior notes or to pay any cash payable on future exchanges of our exchangeable senior notes as required by those indentures would constitute a default under those indentures. A default under those indentures could also lead to a default under other debt agreements or obligations, including the amended credit agreement. Likewise, a default under the amended\ncredit agreement could also lead to a default under other debt agreements or obligations, including the indentures governing our exchangeable senior notes.\nTo continue to grow our business, we will need to commit substantial resources, which could result in future losses or otherwise limit our opportunities or affect our ability to operate and grow our business.\nThe scope of our business and operations has grown substantially since 2012, including through a series of business combinations and acquisitions. To continue to grow our business over the longer term, we plan to commit substantial resources to product acquisition and in-licensing, product development, clinical trials of product candidates and expansion of our commercial, development, manufacturing and other operations. Acquisition opportunities that we pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur additional indebtedness, seek equity capital or both. In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may not be able to borrow or raise additional capital on attractive terms, or at all, which could prevent us from expanding our business and otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business and growth prospects. In addition, if we use a substantial amount of our funds to acquire or in-license products or product candidates, we may not have sufficient additional funds to conduct all of our operations in the manner we would otherwise choose.\nWe have significant intangible assets and goodwill. Consequently, the future impairment of our intangible assets and goodwill may significantly impact our profitability.\nOur intangible assets and goodwill are significant and are subject to an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Additionally, goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are subject to an impairment test at least annually. Events giving rise to impairment are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and cannot be predicted. Our results of operations and financial position in future periods could be negatively impacted should future impairments of intangible assets or goodwill occur.\nOur financial results have been and may continue to be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nBecause our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as the functional currency financial statements of non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. To the extent that revenue and expense transactions are not denominated in the functional currency, we are also subject to the risk of transaction losses. For example, because our Defitelio, Erwinase and Vyxeos product sales outside of the U.S. are primarily denominated in the euro, our sales of those products have been and may continue to be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Given the volatility of exchange rates, as well as our expanding operations, there is no guarantee that we will be able to effectively manage currency transaction and/or translation risks, which could adversely affect our operating results. Although we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to manage currency risk primarily related to certain intercompany balances denominated in non-functional currencies, our efforts to manage currency risk may not be successful.\nChanges in our effective tax rates could adversely affect our business and financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe are incorporated in Ireland and maintain subsidiaries in North America and a number of other foreign jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions where we operate. Our effective tax rate may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the distribution of our profits or losses between the jurisdictions where we operate and changes to or differences in interpretation of tax laws. We are subject to reviews and audits by the U.S. Internal Revenue Services, or IRS, and other taxing authorities from time to time, and the IRS or other taxing authority may challenge our structure, transfer pricing arrangements and tax positions through an audit or lawsuit. Responding to or defending against challenges from taxing authorities could be expensive and consume time and other resources. If we are unsuccessful, we may be required to pay taxes for prior periods, interest, fines or penalties, and may be obligated to pay increased taxes in the future, any of which could require us to reduce our operating expenses, decrease efforts in support of our products or seek to raise additional funds. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe IRS may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes.\nAlthough we are incorporated in Ireland, the IRS may assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, or the Code. For U.S. federal tax purposes, a corporation generally is considered a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation. Because we are an Irish incorporated entity, we would be classified as a foreign corporation (and, therefore, a non-U.S. tax resident) under these rules. Section 7874 of the Code provides an exception under which a foreign incorporated entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. Because we indirectly acquired all of Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\u2019s assets through the acquisition of the shares of Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc. common\nstock in the Azur Merger, the IRS could assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes under Section 7874. The IRS continues to scrutinize transactions that are potentially subject to Section 7874, and has issued several sets of final and temporary regulations under Section 7874 since 2012. We do not expect these regulations to affect the U.S. tax consequences of the Azur Merger. Nevertheless, new statutory and/or regulatory provisions under Section 7874 of the Code or otherwise could be enacted that adversely affect our status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, and any such provisions could have prospective or retroactive application to us, our shareholders, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and/or the Azur Merger.\nOur U.S. affiliates\u2019 ability to use their net operating losses to offset potential taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is limited under Section 7874 of the Code and could be subject to further limitations if we do not generate taxable income in a timely manner or if the \u201cownership change\u201d provisions of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code result in further annual limitations.\nFollowing certain acquisitions of a U.S. corporation by a foreign corporation, Section 7874 of the Code can limit the ability of the acquired U.S. corporation and its U.S. affiliates to utilize U.S. tax attributes such as net operating losses, or NOLs, to offset U.S. taxable income resulting from certain transactions. Our U.S. affiliates have a significant amount of NOLs. As a result of Section 7874 of the Code, after the Azur Merger, our U.S. affiliates have not been able and will continue to be unable, for a period of time, to utilize their U.S. tax attributes to offset their U.S. taxable income, if any, resulting from certain taxable transactions. While we expect to be able to fully utilize our U.S. affiliates\u2019 U.S. NOLs prior to their expiration, as a result of this limitation, it may take our U.S. affiliates longer to use their NOLs.\nOur ability to use these NOLs to offset potential future taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is also dependent upon our generation of future taxable income before the expiration dates of the NOLs, and we cannot predict with certainty when, or whether, our U.S. affiliates will generate sufficient taxable income to use all of the NOLs. In addition, the use of NOLs to offset potential future taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is subject to annual limitations under the \u201cownership change\u201d provisions of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code and similar state provisions, which may result in the expiration of additional NOLs before future utilization.\nChanges to tax laws relating to multinational corporations could adversely affect us.\nThe U.S. Congress, the EU, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, and other government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is the OECD\u2019s initiative in the area of \u201cbase erosion and profit shifting,\u201d where payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. Some countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the OECD\u2019s recommendation. As a result of the focus on the taxation of multinational corporations, the tax laws in Ireland, the U.S. and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect us.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or U.S. Tax Act, was signed into law. The U.S. Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code. The U.S. Department of Treasury has issued limited regulations and other interpretive guidance under the U.S. Tax Act, and is expected to issue additional guidance, the impact of which is uncertain but could change the financial impacts that were previously recorded or are expected to be recorded in future periods. Furthermore, the impact of this tax reform on certain holders of our ordinary shares could be adverse. Among other things, changes to the rules for determining a foreign corporation\u2019s status as a controlled foreign corporation could have an adverse effect on U.S. persons who are treated as owning (directly or indirectly) at least 10% of the value or voting power of our ordinary shares. Investors should consult their own advisers regarding the potential application of these rules to their investments.\nA substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates based on USD LIBOR and certain of our financial contracts are also indexed to USD LIBOR. Changes in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates on our current or future indebtedness and may otherwise adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, the authority that regulates the London Inter-bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, announced that it intended to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. We have certain financial contracts, including the amended credit agreement and our interest rate swaps, that are indexed to USD LIBOR. Changes in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates on our current or future indebtedness. Any transition process may involve, among other things, increased volatility or illiquidity in markets for instruments that rely on LIBOR, reductions in the value of certain instruments or the effectiveness of related transactions such as hedges, increased borrowing costs, uncertainty under applicable documentation, or difficult and costly consent processes. The transition away from LIBOR may result in increased expenses, may impair our ability to refinance our indebtedness or hedge our exposure to floating rate instruments, or may result in\ndifficulties, complications or delays in connection with future financing efforts, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Ordinary Shares\nThe market price of our ordinary shares has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future, and the value of your investment could decline significantly.\nThe market price for our ordinary shares has fluctuated significantly from time to time and is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market, industry and other factors, including the risk factors described above. The stock market in general, including the market for life sciences companies, has experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors have harmed, and in the future may seriously harm, the market price of our ordinary shares, regardless of our operating performance.\nOur share price may be dependent upon the valuations and recommendations of the analysts who cover our business. If our results do not meet these analysts\u2019 forecasts, the expectations of our investors or the financial guidance we provide to investors in any period, the market price of our ordinary shares could decline. Our ability to meet analysts\u2019 forecasts, investors\u2019 expectations and our financial guidance is substantially dependent on our ability to maintain or increase sales of our marketed products.\nIn addition, the market price of our ordinary shares may decline if the effects of our strategic transactions on our financial or operating results are not consistent with the expectations of financial analysts or investors. The market price of our ordinary shares could also be affected by possible sales of our ordinary shares by holders of our exchangeable senior notes who may view our exchangeable senior notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity involving our ordinary shares by the holders of our exchangeable senior notes.\nWe are subject to Irish law, which differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.\nIt may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in Ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S. currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland.\nAs an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act 2014, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions, mergers, amalgamations and acquisitions, takeovers and shareholder lawsuits. The duties of directors and officers of an Irish company are generally owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a U.S. jurisdiction.\nOur articles of association, Irish law and the indentures governing our exchangeable senior notes contain provisions that could delay or prevent a takeover of us by a third party.\nOur articles of association could delay, defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit to our shareholders, or otherwise adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares. In addition to our articles of association, several mandatory provisions of Irish law could prevent or delay an acquisition of us. We are also subject to various provisions of Irish law relating to mandatory bids, voluntary bids, requirements to make a cash offer and minimum price requirements, as well as substantial acquisition rules and rules requiring the disclosure of interests in our shares in certain circumstances. Furthermore, the indentures governing our exchangeable senior notes require us to repurchase our exchangeable senior notes for cash if we undergo certain fundamental changes and, in certain circumstances, to increase the exchange rate for a holder of our exchangeable senior notes. A takeover of us may trigger the requirement that we purchase our exchangeable senior notes and/or increase the exchange rate, which could make it more costly for a potential acquiror to engage in a business combination transaction with us.\nThese provisions, whether alone or together, may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our ordinary shares at a premium over the market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders\nof, our ordinary shares. These provisions, whether alone or together, could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our shareholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board.\nFuture sales and issuances of our ordinary shares, securities convertible into our ordinary shares or rights to purchase ordinary shares or convertible securities could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our shareholders and could cause our share price to decline.\nWe expect to continue to opportunistically seek access to additional capital to license or acquire additional products, product candidates or companies to expand our operations or for general corporate purposes. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for ordinary shares, our shareholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell ordinary shares, and we may sell convertible or exchangeable securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell such ordinary shares, convertible or exchangeable securities or other equity securities in subsequent transactions, existing shareholders may be materially diluted.\nWe have never declared or paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not currently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the payment of dividends will, subject to Irish legal requirements, be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, compliance with the terms of the amended credit agreement and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, holders of our ordinary shares must rely on increases in the trading price of their shares for returns on their investment in the foreseeable future. In addition, in the event that we pay a dividend on our ordinary shares, in certain circumstances, as an Irish tax resident company, some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax, which could adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares.", "PERMNO": 92096, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "JAZZ"}
