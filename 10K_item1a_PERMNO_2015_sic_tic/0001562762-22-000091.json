{"cik": "315858", "company": "Bluegreen Vacations Holding Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company is subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to Bluegreen\u2019s business and to the ownership and value of its stock, and general business, economic, financing, legal, regulatory, and other factors and conditions. In addition, new risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to either predict all risk factors or assess all potential impacts of any factor, or combination of factors. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and actual results and events may differ substantially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements. See \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nBVH is a holding company and will rely primarily on dividends from Bluegreen to its operations and to service its debt, including its note payable to BBX Capital.\nAll of BVH\u2019s operations and activities relate to the operations and activities of Bluegreen, and BVH will rely primarily on dividends from Bluegreen to service its debt and to fund its other cash requirements.\nIn connection with its spin-off of BBX Capital, its former wholly owned subsidiary, on September 30, 2020, the Company issued a $75.0 million promissory note in favor of BBX Capital. The note payable to BBX Capital accrues interest at a rate of 6% per annum and requires payments of interest on a quarterly basis; provided, however, that interest payments may be deferred at the option of the Company, with interest on the entire outstanding balance thereafter to accrue at a cumulative, compounded rate of 8% per annum until such time as the Company is current on all accrued payments under the note, including deferred interest. All outstanding amounts under the note will become due and payable in September 2025 or earlier upon certain events. In December 2021, the Company repaid $25.0 million of the note payable to BBX Capital, leaving a balance as of December 31, 2021 of $50.0 million.\nThe Company\u2019s indebtedness at the holding company level also includes $66.3 million of junior subordinated debentures issued by Woodbridge Holdings Corporation (\u201cWoodbridge\u201d), the wholly owned subsidiary through which the Company holds its investment in Bluegreen. Woodbridge\u2019s junior subordinated debentures accrue interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 3.80% to 3.85%, mature between 2035 and 2036, and require payments of interest on a quarterly basis. The Company may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. The Company\u2019s indebtedness increases its vulnerability to adverse economic conditions, as well as conditions in the credit markets generally, and may limit funds available for other purposes, including for acquisitions or investments, to pay dividends, and for other general corporate purposes.\nIt is currently expected that BVH will incur approximately $2.0 million to $2.2 million annually in executive compensation and public company costs and annual interest expense of approximately $5.7 million to $6.0 million associated with Woodbridge\u2019s junior subordinated debentures and the note payable to BBX Capital. These amounts are estimates only and are based on current expectations and assumptions, currently available information and, with respect to interest expense on Woodbridge\u2019s junior subordinated debentures, interest rates as of December 31, 2021. Such assumptions and expectations may not prove to be accurate, interest rates may increase and, accordingly, actual expenses may exceed the amounts expected. In addition, BVH may incur additional expenses.\nBVH will be dependent on the payment of distributions by Bluegreen to fund its operations and satisfy its debt service requirements and other liabilities, including its note payable to BBX Capital. BVH may also in the future seek additional funds from third party sources, including traditional bank financing, secured or unsecured indebtedness, or the issuance of equity and/or debt securities. However, these alternatives may not be available to BVH on attractive terms, in the amounts needed, or at all. There is no assurance that Bluegreen will be in a position to, or will otherwise be permitted (including due to restrictions set forth in its debt instruments), to pay dividends to BVH in the amounts necessary to fund its debt service or other obligations, or at all. The inability to receive distributions from Bluegreen or to obtain funds from third party sources would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAlan B. Levan, John E. Abdo, Jarett S. Levan and Seth M. Wise\u2019s control position may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.\nAlan B. Levan, the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, John E. Abdo, the Vice Chairman of the Company, Jarett S. Levan, the son of Mr. Alan Levan, a director of the Company and former President\nof the Company, and Seth M. Wise, a director of the Company and former Executive Vice President of the Company, currently collectively beneficially own 4% of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock, and 75% of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock which in the aggregate represent approximately 79% of the total voting power of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. Because holders of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock vote as a single class on most matters, including the election of directors, as described below, Mr. Alan Levan, Mr. Abdo, Mr. Jarett Levan and Mr. Wise, without the vote or consent of any other shareholder of the Company, have the voting power to elect the Company\u2019s directors and to control the outcome of any other vote of the Company\u2019s shareholders, except in limited circumstances where Florida law mandates that the holders of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock vote as a separate class. This control position may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. In addition, their interests may conflict with the interests of the Company\u2019s other shareholders.\nThe Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation provide for fixed relative voting percentages between the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.\nThe Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation provide for holders of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock to generally vote together as a single class, including with respect to the election of directors, with holders of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock possessing in the aggregate 22% of the total voting power of all common stock and holders of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock possessing in the aggregate the remaining 78% of the total voting power. These relative voting percentages will remain fixed unless the number of shares of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock outstanding decreases to 360,000 shares, at which time the aggregate voting power of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock will increase to 40% and the aggregate voting power of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock will decrease to 60%. If the number of shares of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock outstanding decreases to 280,000 shares, then the aggregate voting power of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock will increase to 53% and the aggregate voting power of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock will decrease to 47%. If the number of shares of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock outstanding decreases to 100,000 shares, then the fixed voting percentages will be eliminated and each share of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock will be entitled to one vote per share. The share thresholds set forth above are subject to equitable adjustment to reflect any stock split, reverse stock split or similar transaction. The changes in the relative voting power represented by each class of the Company\u2019s common stock are based only on the number of shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding, thus issuances of Class A Common Stock will have no effect on these provisions. If additional shares of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock are issued without a comparative increase in the number of outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock, the disparity between the equity interest represented by the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock and its voting power will widen. In addition, shareholders who hold shares of both the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, including Alan B. Levan, John E. Abdo, Jarett S. Levan and Seth M. Wise, are able to sell shares of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock without affecting in any material respect their overall voting interest. The fixed voting percentages between the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock may have an adverse impact on the market price of such securities.\n\u200e\nProvisions in the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and provisions of Florida law may make it difficult for a third party to acquire the Company and could impact the price of, or otherwise adversely impact, the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.\nThe Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that could delay, defer or prevent a change of control of the Company or its management. These provisions could make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock. These provisions include:\n\uf0b7the provisions in the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation regarding the special voting rights of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock;\n\uf0b7subject to the special class voting rights of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock under certain circumstances, the authority of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock and to fix the relative rights and preferences of the preferred stock without shareholder approval, as described in further detail below; and\n\uf0b7advance notice procedures to be complied with by shareholders in order to make shareholder proposals or nominate directors.\nFurther, due to the control position of Mr. Alan Levan, Mr. Abdo, Mr. Jarett Levan and Mr. Wise with respect to the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, as described above, a change of control or sale of the Company, or any other action which requires the affirmative vote of holders of shares of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock representing a majority of the voting power of such stock, will be impossible without the consent of Mr. Alan Levan, Mr. Abdo, Mr. Jarett Levan and Mr. Wise, and Mr. Alan Levan, Mr. Abdo, Mr. Jarett Levan and Mr. Wise\u2019s interests may conflict with the interests of the Company\u2019s other shareholders.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Florida law, except as may be required by applicable securities exchange rules and subject to the separate voting rights of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock in certain circumstances, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors may, without the consent of the Company\u2019s shareholders, approve the issuance of authorized but unissued shares of the Company\u2019s securities and fix the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. If the Company issues additional shares of its Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock or other securities, its shareholders would experience dilution. In addition, any preferred stock declared and issued could include dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption and liquidation preferences, any or all of which may be greater than the rights of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock or otherwise adversely affect the holders of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, including the likelihood that holders of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock would receive dividend payments and payments on liquidation, or the amounts thereof. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions, financing transactions and other corporate purposes, could also, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or other corporate actions, and might adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock. Preferred stock may also be issued, or reserved for issuance, in connection with the adoption of a shareholder rights plan, which may have anti-takeover effects. A shareholder rights plan may be adopted by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors without shareholder approval or consent. The Company\u2019s previous shareholder rights plan was terminated during May 2021 in connection with the Company\u2019s acquisition at that time of the approximately 7% of Bluegreen\u2019s common stock not previously owned by the Company.\nIn addition, as a Florida corporation, the Company is also subject to the provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act (the \u201cFBCA\u201d), including those limiting the voting rights of \u201ccontrol shares.\u201d Under the FBCA, subject to certain exceptions, including mergers and acquisitions effected in accordance with the FBCA, the holder of \u201ccontrol shares\u201d of a Florida corporation that has (i) 100 or more shareholders, (ii) its principal place of business, its principal office or substantial assets in Florida and (iii) either more than 10% of its shareholders residing in Florida, more than 10% of its shares owned by Florida residents or 1,000 shareholders residing in Florida, will not have the right to vote those shares unless the acquisition of the shares was approved by a majority of each class of voting securities of the corporation, excluding those shares held by interested persons. \u201cControl shares\u201d are defined in the FBCA as shares\nacquired by a person, either directly or indirectly, that when added to all other shares of the issuing corporation owned by that person, would entitle that person to exercise, either directly or indirectly, voting power within any of the following ranges: (i) 20% or more but less than 33% of all voting power of the corporation\u2019s voting securities; (ii) 33% or more but less than a majority of all voting power of the corporation\u2019s voting securities; or (iii) a majority or more of all of the voting power of the corporation\u2019s voting securities.\nAcquisitions pursued by the Company may reduce earnings, require it to obtain additional financing and expose it to additional risks.\nThe Company may in the future pursue acquisitions or strategic investments. To the extent pursued and completed, acquisitions and investments may not result in the benefits anticipated or otherwise prove to be successful. Acquisitions or investments will also expose the Company to the risks of the businesses acquired or invested in and entail numerous other risks, including, but not limited to:\n\uf0b7risks associated with achieving profitability;\n\uf0b7diversion of management attention;\n\uf0b7integration difficulties;\n\uf0b7losses and unforeseen expenses or liabilities;\n\uf0b7risks associated with entering new markets, if applicable;\n\uf0b7the potential loss of key employees or management; and\n\uf0b7risks associated with transferred assets and liabilities.\nIn addition, there may be significant competition for investments and acquisitions, which could increase the costs associated with the investment or acquisition. Substantial costs would be incurred in connection with the evaluation of potential acquisition and investment opportunities whether or not the acquisition or investment is ultimately consummated. Further, the funding of such investments or acquisitions may require additional debt or equity financing. If the Company requires additional financing in the future, the financing may not be available when needed or on favorable terms, if at all. Additionally, the Company does not intend to seek shareholder approval of any investments or acquisitions unless required by law or regulation, including applicable securities exchange rules, or by the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws.\nFuture sales of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may cause the market price of such securities to decline.\nSubstantial sales of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, including sales of shares by controlling shareholders and management, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market prices of such securities. Management has in the past and may in the future enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans pursuant to which a significant number of shares are sold into the open market. In addition, as described above, due to the fixed voting percentages of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock of 22% and 78%, respectively, holders of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock who also own shares of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock, including Alan B. Levan, John E. Abdo, Jarett S. Levan and Seth M. Wise, may sell a significant number of shares of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock that they own without significantly decreasing their voting power.\nThe Company\u2019s Bylaws contain an exclusive forum provision, which could impair the ability of shareholders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for certain disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or other employees and be cost-prohibitive to shareholders.\nThe Company\u2019s Bylaws contain an exclusive forum provision which provides that, unless its Board of Directors consents to the selection of an alternative forum, the Circuit Court located in Broward County, Florida (or, if such Circuit Court does not have jurisdiction, another Circuit Court located within Florida or, if no Circuit Court located within Florida has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the Southern District of Florida) will be the sole and exclusive forum for \u201cCovered Proceedings,\u201d which include: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on the Company\u2019s behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of the Company\u2019s directors, officers or other employees to the Company or its shareholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against the\nCompany or any of its directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the FBCA, or the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws (in each case, as may be amended or amended and restated from time to time); and (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any of its directors, officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Florida. To the extent within the categories set forth in the preceding sentence, Covered Proceedings include causes of action under the Exchange Act and the Securities Act. The exclusive forum provision will also provide that if any Covered Proceeding is filed in a court other than a court located within Florida in the name of any shareholder, then such shareholder shall be deemed to have consented to (a) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within Florida in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the exclusive forum provision and (b) having service of process made upon such shareholder in any such enforcement action by service upon such shareholder\u2019s counsel in the action as agent for such shareholder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, shareholders cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The exclusive forum provision may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or other employees or be cost-prohibitive to shareholders, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company or its directors, officers and other employees. However, there is uncertainty regarding whether a court would enforce the exclusive forum provision. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\ufeff\nThe Company may not resume regular quarterly dividends or otherwise pay dividends on its Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock in the future.\n\ufeff\nThe Company paid regular quarterly cash dividends from June 2016 through the first quarter of 2020. However, in April 2020, the Company suspended its regular quarterly dividend payment due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no assurance that the Company will resume paying regular quarterly dividends or otherwise make any dividend payments in the future. The payments of dividends by the Company, if any, will depend on many factors considered by its Board of Directors, including, without limitation, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, liquidity requirements, market opportunities, and contractual constraints. The terms of the Company\u2019s indebtedness may also restrict it from paying cash dividends on its stock under certain circumstances.\nRisks Related to Bluegreen\u2019s Business and the Vacation Ownership Industry\nBluegreen is subject to the business, financial and operating risks inherent to the vacation ownership industry, any of which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, prospects and results.\nBluegreen is subject to a number of business, financial and operating risks inherent to the vacation ownership industry, including, without limitation:\n\uf0b7significant competition from other vacation ownership businesses and hospitality and alternative lodging providers;\n\uf0b7market and/or consumer perception of vacation ownership companies and the industry in general;\n\uf0b7increases in operating and other costs (as a result of inflation or otherwise), including marketing costs, employee compensation and benefits, interest expense and insurance, which may not be offset by price or fee increases in Bluegreen\u2019s business;\n\uf0b7Bluegreen\u2019s ability to maintain, enhance or expand, or achieve the benefits achieved from, its marketing arrangements and relationships;\n\uf0b7changes in taxes and governmental regulations, including those that influence or set wages, prices, interest rates or construction and maintenance procedures and costs;\n\uf0b7the costs and efforts associated with complying with applicable laws and regulations, and the costs and consequences of non-compliance;\n\uf0b7risks related to the development or acquisition of resorts and inventory, including delays in, or cancellations of, planned or future resort development or inventory acquisition activities;\n\uf0b7shortages of labor or labor disruptions;\n\uf0b7the availability and cost of capital necessary for Bluegreen and third-party developers with whom Bluegreen does business to fund investments and capital expenditures and to service debt obligations;\n\uf0b7Bluegreen\u2019s ability to securitize the receivables that Bluegreen originates in connection with VOI sales;\n\uf0b7relationships with and the performance and the financial condition of third-party developers with whom Bluegreen does business;\n\uf0b7relationships with the Vacation Club owners and HOAs;\n\uf0b7changes in the supply and demand for Bluegreen\u2019s products and services;\n\uf0b7lack of security over, or unauthorized access to, customer or Company records;\n\uf0b7private resales of VOIs and the sale of VOIs in the secondary market;\n\uf0b7the increased presence and effort of \u201ctimeshare-exit\u201d firms and their impact on borrower default rates; and\n\uf0b7unlawful or deceptive third-party VOI resale, cease and desist, or vacation package sales schemes, and reputational risk associated therewith.\nAny of these factors could increase Bluegreen\u2019s costs, limit or reduce the prices Bluegreen is able to charge for its products and services, adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s ability to develop or acquire new resorts, or otherwise adversely impact Bluegreen\u2019s business, prospects and results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and the current and uncertain future outlook of the pandemic may continue to have, a significant adverse effect on Bluegreen\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented disruption in the U.S. and global economies and the industries in which Bluegreen operates due to, among other things, government ordered \u201cshelter in place\u201d and \u201cstay at home\u201d orders and advisories, travel restrictions, and restrictions on business operations, including government guidance with respect to travel, public accommodations, social gatherings, and related matters. These disruptions and the reaction of the general public to the pandemic had a significant adverse impact on Bluegreen's financial condition and operations throughout 2020, including, without limitation, due to the temporary closure beginning in March 2020 of all of Bluegreen\u2019s VOI sales centers, its retail marketing operations at Bass Pro Shops and Cabela\u2019s stores and outlet malls, and its Choice Hotels call transfer program, Bluegreen\u2019s cancellation of existing owner reservations through May 15, 2020 and new prospect guest tours through June 30, 2020, and the temporary closure of certain of Bluegreen\u2019s Club Resorts and Club Associate Resorts in accordance with government mandates and advisories. While operations at Bass Pro Shops and Cabela\u2019s stores subsequently re-opened, the Choice Hotels call transfer program is close to pre-pandemic volume, all of our VOI sales centers and resorts re-opened (except for one resort and sales center in Surfside, Florida which was closed due to conditions unrelated to the pandemic) and our business and results generally improved during 2021, adverse conditions have continued, as a result of the emergence of new variants such as the Delta variant and Omicron variant which emerged as a variant of concern during the fourth quarter of 2021.\nIn addition, Bluegreen has historically financed a majority of its sales of VOIs, and accordingly, is subject to the risk of defaults by its customers. Bluegreen continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its default or delinquency rates as it is rapidly changing and highly uncertain. Accordingly, and due to other risks and uncertainties associated with assumptions and changing market conditions, Bluegreen\u2019s allowance for loan losses may not prove to be accurate and may be increased in future periods, which would adversely impact its operating results for those periods.\nFurther, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in instability and volatility in the financial markets. Bluegreen\u2019s ability to borrow against or sell its VOI notes receivable has historically been a critical factor in its liquidity. If Bluegreen is unable to renew credit facilities or obtain new credit facilities, its business, results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition may be materially, adversely impacted.\nBluegreen\u2019s operations could also be negatively affected further if its employees are quarantined or sickened as a result of exposure to COVID-19, or if they are subject to governmental COVID-19 curfews or \u201cshelter in place\u201d health orders. Measures restricting the ability of employees to come to work may impair Bluegreen\u2019s service or operations, all of which could negatively affect its business.\nWe hope that general economic conditions and conditions in the travel and leisure industry continue to improve, however the continued future impact of the pandemic and its impact on Bluegreen is uncertain. Various state and local government officials may in the future issue new or revised orders that are different than the ones under which we are\ncurrently operating. It is impossible to predict the duration and severity of the pandemic and the potential impact of the pandemic on our business, including our future revenues, net income and other operating results. The overall situation is extremely fluid, and it is impossible to predict the timing of future changes in the situation and what their impact may be on our business. Moreover, we cannot predict whether the COVID-19 pandemic will result in permanent changes to our customers' or general consumer behavior, which may include, without limitation, continued or permanent decreases in discretionary spending and reductions in travel or vacation ownership stays or purchases, each of which would have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nBluegreen\u2019s business and properties are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies. Changes in these laws, regulations and policies, as well as the cost of complying with new or existing laws, regulations and policies and the imposition of additional taxes on operations, as well as new cell phone technologies that automatically identify or block marketing vendor calls, could adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s business. Further, jurisdictions are increasingly seeking to identify additional sources of tax revenue and results of audits of Bluegreen\u2019s tax returns or those of its subsidiaries may also have a material adverse impact on its financial condition.\nThe federal government and the state and local jurisdictions in which Bluegreen operates have enacted extensive regulations that affect the manner in which Bluegreen markets and sells VOIs and conducts its other business operations. In addition, federal, state and local regulators may enact new laws and regulations that may adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s results or require Bluegreen to modify its business practices substantially. Many states, including Florida and South Carolina, where certain of Bluegreen\u2019s resorts are located, extensively regulate VOI and timeshare-related activities, including the sale of VOIs, the creation and management of resorts, the marketing and sale of properties, the escrow of purchaser funds prior to the completion of construction and closing, the content and use of advertising materials and promotional offers, the delivery of an offering memorandum and the creation and operation of exchange programs and multi-site timeshare plan reservation systems. Moreover, with regard to sales conducted in South Carolina, the closing of real estate and mortgage loan transactions must be conducted under the supervision of an attorney licensed in South Carolina and otherwise in accordance with South Carolina\u2019s Timesharing Transaction Procedures Act.\nMost states also have other laws that are applicable to Bluegreen\u2019s activities, such as timeshare project registration laws, real estate licensure laws, mortgage licensure laws, sellers of travel licensure laws, anti-fraud laws, consumer protection laws, telemarketing laws, prize, gift and sweepstakes laws, and consumer credit laws. Bluegreen\u2019s management of, and dealings with, HOAs, including its purchase of defaulted inventory from HOAs in connection with its secondary market sales, are also subject to state laws and resort rules and regulations, including those with respect to the establishment of budgets and expenditures, rule-making, and the imposition of maintenance assessments.\nBluegreen is authorized to market and sell VOIs in all locations at which its marketing and sales activities are conducted. If Bluegreen\u2019s agents or employees violate applicable regulations or licensing requirements, their acts or omissions could cause the states where the violations occurred to revoke or refuse to renew Bluegreen\u2019s licenses, render its sales contracts void or voidable, or impose fines on Bluegreen based on past activities.\nIn addition, the federal government and the state and local jurisdictions in which Bluegreen conducts business have generally enacted extensive regulations relating to direct marketing and telemarketing, including the federal government\u2019s national \u201cdo not call\u201d list, the making of marketing and related calls to cell phone users, a significant development in light of cell phone usage becoming the primary method of communication, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. These regulations, as well as international data protection laws, have impacted Bluegreen\u2019s marketing of VOIs. While Bluegreen has taken steps designed to achieve compliance with applicable regulations, these steps are expected to continue to increase Bluegreen\u2019s marketing costs and may not prevent failures in compliance. Additionally, adoption of new state or federal laws regulating marketing and solicitation, new case law, and changes to existing laws, could adversely affect current or planned marketing activities and cause Bluegreen to change its marketing strategy. If this occurs, Bluegreen may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies, which could affect the amount and timing of its VOI sales. Bluegreen cannot predict the impact that these legislative initiatives or any other legislative measures that may be proposed or enacted in the future may have on its marketing strategies and results. Further, from time to time, complaints are filed against Bluegreen by individuals claiming that they received calls in violation of applicable regulations. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Company\u2019s audited consolidated financial\nstatements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Technology advances, including new cellphone technologies that automatically identify or block marketing vendor calls, may also adversely impact Bluegreen\u2019s telemarketing efforts or otherwise cause Bluegreen to change its marketing strategy.\nMost states have taxed VOIs as real estate, imposing property taxes that are billed to the respective HOAs that maintain the related resorts, and have not sought to impose sales tax upon the sale of the VOI or accommodations tax upon the use of the VOI. From time to time, however, various states have attempted to promulgate new laws or apply existing laws impacting the taxation of VOIs to require that sales or accommodations taxes be collected. Should new state or local laws be implemented or interpreted to impose sales or accommodations taxes on VOIs, Bluegreen\u2019s business could be materially adversely affected.\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of Bluegreen\u2019s business, consumers file complaints against Bluegreen. Bluegreen may be required to incur significant costs to resolve these complaints or enter into consents with regulators regarding its activities, including requiring the refund of all or a portion of the purchase price paid by the customer for the VOI. If Bluegreen is found to have not complied with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, such violations may have adverse implications on Bluegreen, including rendering its VOI sales contracts void or voidable, negative publicity, potential litigation and regulatory fines or other sanctions. The expense, negative publicity and potential sanctions associated with any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on Bluegreen\u2019s business, results of operations or financial position.\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Accessibility Guidelines promulgated thereunder (collectively, the \u201cADA\u201d), all public accommodations, including Bluegreen\u2019s properties, must meet various federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with the ADA\u2019s requirements could require removal of access barriers or other renovations, and non-compliance could result in the imposition of fines or penalties, or awards of damages, against Bluegreen. Bluegreen\u2019s properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. Further, various laws govern Bluegreen\u2019s resort management activities, including laws and regulations regarding community association management, public lodging, food and beverage services, liquor licensing, labor, employment, health care, health and safety, accessibility, discrimination, immigration, and the environment (including climate change).\nBluegreen\u2019s lending activities are also subject to a number of laws and regulations, including laws and regulations related to consumer loans, retail installment contracts, mortgage lending, fair debt collection and credit reporting practices, consumer collection practices, contacting debtors by telephone, mortgage disclosure, lender licenses and money laundering. The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, created under the Dodd-Frank Act, has emphasized new regulatory focus on areas of Bluegreen\u2019s business such as consumer mortgage servicing and debt collection, credit reporting and consumer financial disclosures, all of which affect the manner in which Bluegreen may provide financing to the purchasers of its VOIs and conduct its lending and loan servicing operations.\nThe vacation ownership and hospitality industries are highly competitive, and Bluegreen may not be able to compete successfully.\nBluegreen competes with various high profile and well-established operators, many of which have greater liquidity and financial resources than Bluegreen. Many of the world\u2019s most recognized lodging, hospitality and entertainment companies develop and sell timeshare units or VOIs in resort properties. Bluegreen also competes with numerous smaller owners and operators of vacation ownership resorts and also face competition from alternative lodging options available to consumers through both traditional methods of delivery as well as new web portals and applications, including private rentals of homes, apartments or condominium units, which have increased in popularity in recent years. Bluegreen\u2019s ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain customers depends on its customers\u2019 satisfaction with Bluegreen\u2019s products and services as well as on distinguishing the quality, value, and efficiency of Bluegreen\u2019s products and services from those offered by its competitors. Customer dissatisfaction with experiences at Bluegreen\u2019s resorts or otherwise as a Vacation Club owner, including due to an inability to use points for desired stays, could result in negative publicity and/or a decrease in sales, or otherwise adversely impact Bluegreen\u2019s ability to successfully compete in the vacation ownership and hospitality industries. Bluegreen may not be able to timely and sufficiently identify and remediate the cause of customer dissatisfaction. Any of these events could materially and adversely impact Bluegreen\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nThere are risks associated with Bluegreen\u2019s strategic partnerships and arrangements.\nBluegreen generates a significant portion of its new sales prospects and leads through its arrangements with various third parties, including Bass Pro and Choice Hotels, and are dependent upon these relationships in order to acquire new customers. VOI sales to prospects and leads generated by Bluegreen\u2019s marketing arrangement with Bass Pro accounted for approximately 19% and 12% of Bluegreen\u2019s VOI sales volume during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. If Bluegreen\u2019s agreement with Bass Pro, or any other significant marketing arrangement, does not generate a sufficient number of prospects and leads or is terminated or not renewed, limited or changed in a manner which adversely affects Bluegreen\u2019s operations and not replaced by a comparable source of sales prospects and leads, Bluegreen may not be able to market and sell its products and services at current sales levels, at anticipated levels or at levels required in order to offset the costs associated with its marketing efforts. In addition, Bluegreen\u2019s business relationship with Bass Pro under the revised terms of the agreement entered into in 2019 may not be as profitable as under the prior terms, or at all, or otherwise result in the benefits anticipated.\nBluegreen\u2019s business and results may be impacted if financing is not available on favorable terms, or at all.\nIn connection with VOI sales, Bluegreen generally offers financing to the purchaser of up to 90% of the purchase price of the VOI. However, Bluegreen incurs selling, marketing and administrative cash expenses prior to and concurrent with the sale. These costs, along with the cost of the underlying VOI, generally exceed the down payment received at the time of the sale. Accordingly, Bluegreen\u2019s ability to borrow against or sell its notes receivable has historically been a critical factor in Bluegreen\u2019s continued liquidity, and Bluegreen therefore has depended on funds from its credit facilities and securitization transactions to finance its operations. If Bluegreen\u2019s pledged receivables facilities terminate or expire and Bluegreen is unable to extend them or replace them with comparable facilities, or if Bluegreen is unable to continue to participate in securitization-type transactions and \u201cwarehouse\u201d facilities on acceptable terms, its liquidity, cash flow and profitability would be materially and adversely affected. Credit market disruptions have in the past adversely impacted the willingness of banks and other finance companies to provide \u201cwarehouse\u201d lines of credit for VOI notes receivable and resulted from time to time in the term securitization market being unavailable. Future credit market disruptions may have similar effects or otherwise make obtaining additional and replacement external sources of liquidity more difficult and more costly, if available at all.\nIn addition, financing for real estate acquisition and development and the capital markets for corporate debt is cyclical. While Bluegreen has increased its focus on encouraging higher down payments in connection with sales, there is no assurance that this initiative will enhance its financial position or otherwise be successful in the long-term.\nBluegreen anticipates that it will continue to seek and use external sources of liquidity, including borrowings under its existing credit facilities, under credit facilities that Bluegreen may obtain in the future, under securitizations in which Bluegreen may participate in the future or pursuant to other borrowing arrangements, to:\n\uf0b7support Bluegreen\u2019s operations and, subject to declaration by its board of directors and contractual limitations, including limitations contained in its credit facilities, pay dividends;\n\uf0b7finance the acquisition and development of VOI inventory or property and equipment;\n\uf0b7finance a substantial percentage of its sales; and\n\uf0b7satisfy its debt and other obligations.\nBluegreen\u2019s ability to service or refinance its indebtedness or to obtain additional financing (including Bluegreen\u2019s ability to consummate future term securitizations) depends on the credit markets and on Bluegreen\u2019s future performance, which is subject to a number of factors, including the success of its business, its results of operations, leverage, financial condition and business prospects, prevailing interest rates, general economic conditions, the performance of its receivables portfolio, and perceptions about the vacation ownership and real estate industries.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Bluegreen had $7.5 million of indebtedness scheduled to become due during 2022. Historically, much of its debt has been renewed or refinanced in the ordinary course of business. However, there is no assurance that Bluegreen will be able to renew, extend or refinance all or any portion of its outstanding debt or otherwise obtain sufficient external sources of liquidity, in each case, on attractive terms, or at all. If Bluegreen is unable to do so, its liquidity and financial condition may be materially, adversely impacted.\nIn addition, Bluegreen has and intends to continue to enter into arrangements with third-party developers pursuant to which Bluegreen sells their VOI inventory for a fee. These arrangements enable Bluegreen to generate fees from the marketing and sales services Bluegreen provides, and in certain cases from its provision of management services, without requiring Bluegreen to fund development and acquisition costs. If these third-party developers are not able to obtain or maintain financing, Bluegreen may not be in a position to enter into these fee-based arrangements or have access to VOI inventory when anticipated, which would adversely impact Bluegreen\u2019s results.\nBluegreen would suffer substantial losses and its liquidity position could be adversely impacted if an increasing number of customers to whom Bluegreen provides financing default on its obligations.\nAdverse conditions in the mortgage industry, including credit availability, borrowers\u2019 financial profiles, prepayment rates and other factors, including the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors outside of Bluegreen\u2019s control may increase the default rates Bluegreen experiences or otherwise negatively impact the performance of its notes receivable. In addition, in recent years, third parties have been discouraging certain borrowers from staying current on Bluegreen\u2019s note payments. Although in many cases Bluegreen may have recourse against a buyer for the unpaid purchase price, certain states have laws that limit Bluegreen\u2019s ability to recover personal judgments against customers who have defaulted on Bluegreen\u2019s loans or Bluegreen may determine that the cost of doing so may not be justified. Historically, Bluegreen had generally not pursued such recourse against its customers. In the case of Bluegreen\u2019s notes receivable secured by VOIs, if Bluegreen is unable to collect the defaulted amount due, Bluegreen traditionally terminated the customer\u2019s interest in the Vacation Club and then remarketed the recovered VOI. Irrespective of its remedy in the event of a default, Bluegreen cannot recover the marketing, selling and administrative costs associated with the original sale and such costs generally exceed the cash received by Bluegreen from the buyer at the time of the sale. In addition, Bluegreen will need to incur such costs again in order to resell the VOI. Bluegreen updates its estimates of such future losses each quarter, and consequently, the charge against sales in a particular period may be impacted, favorably or unfavorably, by a change in expected losses related to notes originated in prior periods. In addition, defaults may cause buyers of, or lenders whose loans are secured by, Bluegreen\u2019s VOI notes receivable to reduce the amount of availability or advance rates under receivables purchase and credit facilities, or result in an increase in the interest costs associated with such facilities. In such an event, the cost of financing may increase and Bluegreen may not be able to secure replacement or alternative financing on terms acceptable to Bluegreen, if at all, which would adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s earnings, financial position and liquidity.\nBluegreen\u2019s VOI notes receivable financing facilities could be adversely affected if a particular VOI note receivable pool fails to meet certain performance ratios, which could occur if the default rate or other credit metrics of the underlying VOI notes receivable deteriorate. In addition, if Bluegreen offers financing to purchasers of VOIs with terms longer than those generally offered in the industry, Bluegreen may not be able to securitize those VOI financing receivables. Bluegreen\u2019s ability to sell securities backed by its VOI notes receivable depends on the continued ability and willingness of capital market participants to invest in such securities. Asset-backed securities issued in its term securitization transactions could be downgraded by credit agencies in the future. If a downgrade occurs, Bluegreen\u2019s ability to complete other securitization transactions on acceptable terms or at all could be jeopardized, and it could be forced to rely on other potentially more expensive and less attractive funding sources, to the extent available. Similarly, if other operators of vacation ownership products were to experience significant financial difficulties, or if the vacation ownership industry as a whole were to contract, Bluegreen could experience difficulty in securing funding on acceptable terms. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely impact Bluegreen\u2019s business and results, including, without limitation, by reducing the amount of financing Bluegreen is able to provide to VOI purchasers, which in turn may result in a decrease in VOI sales. The COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on its VOI notes receivable portfolio, which resulted in an increase in Bluegreen\u2019s allowance for loan losses in 2020 and may result in additional increases or other adverse impacts in the future.\nIn addition, under the terms of Bluegreen\u2019s pledged and receivable sale facilities, Bluegreen may be required, under certain circumstances, to replace receivables or to pay down the loan to within permitted loan-to-value ratios. Additionally, the terms of Bluegreen\u2019s securitization transactions require it to repurchase or replace loans in the event of a breach of any of the representations and warranties Bluegreen made at the time it sold the receivables. These agreements also often include terms providing for substantially all of its cash flow from Bluegreen\u2019s retained interest in the receivable portfolios sold to be paid to the parties who purchased the receivables from Bluegreen in the event\nof defaults or delinquencies by customers in excess of stated thresholds, or if other performance thresholds are not met.\nThe ratings of third-party rating agencies could adversely impact Bluegreen\u2019s ability to obtain, renew or extend credit facilities, or otherwise raise funds.\nRating agencies from time to time review prior specific transaction ratings in light of tightened ratings criteria. Further, specific securitization transactions are reviewed by third-party rating agencies. If rating agencies were to downgrade Bluegreen\u2019s original ratings on certain bond classes in Bluegreen\u2019s securitizations, holders of such bonds may be required to sell bonds in the marketplace, and such sales could occur at a discount, which could impact the perceived value of the bonds and Bluegreen\u2019s ability to sell future bonds on favorable terms or at all. While Bluegreen is not aware of any reasonably likely downgrades to the ratings of bond classes in its securitizations, such ratings changes can occur without advance notice.\nBluegreen\u2019s future success depends on its ability to market Bluegreen\u2019s products and services successfully and efficiently, and Bluegreen\u2019s marketing expenses have increased and may continue to increase in the future.\nAs previously described, Bluegreen competes for customers with hotel and resort properties, other vacation ownership resorts and alternative lodging options, including private rentals of homes, apartments or condominium units. The identification of sales prospects and leads, and the marketing of Bluegreen\u2019s products and services to them are essential to Bluegreen\u2019s success. Bluegreen incurs expenses associated with marketing programs in advance of the closing of sales. If Bluegreen\u2019s lead identification and marketing efforts do not yield enough leads or Bluegreen is unable to successfully convert sales leads to sales, Bluegreen may be unable to recover the expense of its marketing programs and systems and its business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. In addition, while sales to existing owners have increased recently, Bluegreen also continues to focus its marketing efforts on selling to new customers, which typically involves a relatively higher marketing cost compared to sales to existing owners. These efforts may result in increases in Bluegreen\u2019s sales and marketing expenses. If Bluegreen is not successful in offsetting the cost increase with greater sales revenue, its operating results and financial condition would be adversely impacted. In addition, Bluegreen\u2019s marketing efforts are subject to the risk of changing consumer behavior. Changes in consumer behavior may adversely impact the effectiveness of marketing efforts and strategies which Bluegreen has in place and it may not be able to timely and effectively respond to such changes. In addition, Bluegreen may not be able to continue to increase or maintain its level of sales to existing owners.\nIf Bluegreen is unable to develop or acquire VOI inventory or enter into and maintain fee-based service agreements or other arrangements to source VOI inventory, its business and results would be adversely impacted.\nIn addition to developed VOI sales, Bluegreen sources VOIs as part of its capital-light business strategy through fee-based service agreements with third-party developers and through JIT and secondary market arrangements. If Bluegreen is unable to develop or acquire resorts at the levels or in the time frames anticipated, or are unsuccessful in entering into agreements with third-party developers or others to source VOI inventory in connection with its capital-light business strategy, Bluegreen may experience a decline in VOI supply or an increase in VOI cost, which could have a negative impact on its results and operations and/or a decrease in sales. In addition, a decline in VOI supply and sales could result in a decrease in financing revenue that is generated by VOI sales and fee and rental revenue that is generated by Bluegreen\u2019s management services.\nBluegreen\u2019s fee-based sales and marketing arrangements, and JIT and secondary market sales activities, may not be successful or profitable, which would have an adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition.\nBluegreen offers fee-based marketing, sales, resort management and other services to third-party developers, which Bluegreen believes enables it to leverage its expertise in sales and marketing, resort management, mortgage servicing, construction management and title services. Bluegreen intends to continue these activities as such activities generally produce positive cash flow and typically require less capital investment than its traditional vacation ownership business. Bluegreen has attempted to structure these activities to cover its costs and generate a profit. Sales of third-party developers\u2019 VOIs must generate sufficient cash to comply with the terms of Bluegreen\u2019s financing obligations as well as to pay the fees or commissions due to Bluegreen. The third-party developers may not be able to obtain or maintain financing necessary to meet Bluegreen\u2019s requirements, which could impact its ability to sell the developers\u2019\ninventory. While Bluegreen could attempt to utilize other arrangements, including JIT arrangements, where Bluegreen would utilize its receivable credit facilities in order to provide fee-based marketing and sales services, this would reduce the credit otherwise available to Bluegreen and impact profitability. When Bluegreen performs fee-based sales and marketing services, it sells VOIs in resorts developed by third parties as an interest in the Vacation Club. This subjects Bluegreen to a number of risks typically associated with selling products developed by others under its own brand name, including litigation risks. Further, these arrangements may expose Bluegreen to additional risk as Bluegreen does not control development activities or timing of development completion. If third parties with whom it enters into agreements are not able to fulfill their obligations to Bluegreen, the inventory Bluegreen expects to acquire or market and sell on their behalf may not be available when expected or at all, or may not otherwise meet agreed-upon specifications. Further, if these third parties do not perform as expected and Bluegreen does not have access to the expected inventory or obtain access to inventory from alternative sources on a timely basis, its ability to maintain or increase sales levels would be adversely impacted.\nBluegreen also sells VOI inventory through secondary market arrangements which require low levels of capital deployment. In connection with secondary market sales, Bluegreen acquires VOI inventory from Bluegreen\u2019s resorts\u2019 HOAs, generally on a non-committed basis, in close proximity to the timing of when it intends to sell such VOIs. VOIs purchased from HOAs are typically obtained by the HOAs through foreclosure in connection with maintenance fee defaults and are generally acquired by Bluegreen at a discount. While Bluegreen intends to maintain its secondary market sales efforts in the future, it may not be successful in doing so, and these efforts may not result in achieving anticipated results. Further Bluegreen\u2019s secondary market sales activities may subject it to negative publicity, which could adversely impact its reputation and business.\nBluegreen is subject to certain risks associated with its management of resort properties.\nThrough Bluegreen\u2019s management of resorts and ownership of VOIs, Bluegreen is subject to certain risks related to the physical condition and operation of the managed resort properties in its network, including:\n\uf0b7the presence of construction or repair defects or other structural or building damage at any of these resorts, or resorts Bluegreen may develop in the future;\n\uf0b7any noncompliance with or liabilities under applicable environmental, health or safety regulations or requirements or building permit requirements relating to these resorts;\n\uf0b7any costs or damage to physical assets or interruption of access to physical assets or operations resulting from an outbreak of contagious diseases, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, or from natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods and windstorms, which may increase in frequency or severity due to climate change or other factors; and\n\uf0b7claims by employees, members and their guests for injuries sustained on these resort properties.\nSome of these risks may be more significant in connection with the properties for which Bluegreen recently acquired management agreements, particularly any management agreements which were acquired from operators in financial distress. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs as a result of any of the foregoing, Bluegreen may be forced to incur significant costs.\nAdditionally, a number of U.S. federal, state and local laws, including the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and the ADA, impose requirements related to access to and use by disabled persons of a variety of public accommodations and facilities. A determination that Bluegreen managed resorts are subject to, and that they are not in compliance with, these accessibility laws could result in a judicial order requiring compliance, imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. If one of its managed resorts was required to make significant improvements as a result of non-compliance with these accessibility laws, assessments might be needed to fund such improvements, which additional costs may cause Bluegreen\u2019s VOI owners to default on its consumer loans from Bluegreen or cease making required maintenance fee or assessment payments. Also, to the extent that Bluegreen holds interests in a particular resort, Bluegreen would be responsible for its pro rata share of the costs of such improvements. In addition, any new legislation may impose further burdens or restrictions on property owners with respect to access by disabled persons.\nThe resort properties that Bluegreen manages are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, natural resources and worker health and safety, including laws and regulations governing and creating liability relating to the management, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and other\nregulated materials and the cleanup of contaminated sites. The resorts are also subject to various environmental laws and regulations that govern certain aspects of Bluegreen\u2019s ongoing operations. These laws and regulations control such things as the nature and volume of wastewater discharges, quality of water supply and waste management practices. To the extent that Bluegreen holds interests in a particular resort, Bluegreen would be responsible for its pro rata share of losses sustained by such resort as a result of a violation of any such laws and regulations.\nIn addition, Bluegreen may from time to time have disagreements with VOI owners and HOAs relating to the management services it provides. Failure to resolve such disagreements may result in litigation and additional costs. Further, disagreements with HOAs could also result in the loss of management contracts, which would negatively affect its revenue and results, and may also have an adverse impact on its ability to generate sales from existing VOI owners.\nBluegreen\u2019s management contracts are typically structured as \u201ccost-plus,\u201d with an initial term of three years and automatic one year renewals. If a management contract is terminated or not renewed on favorable terms or is renegotiated in a manner adverse to Bluegreen, its revenue and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nBluegreen\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted if Bluegreen does not continue to participate in exchange networks and other strategic alliances with third parties or if its customers are not satisfied with the networks in which Bluegreen participates or its strategic alliances.\nBluegreen believes that its participation in exchange networks and other strategic alliances and its Traveler Plus program make ownership of its VOIs more attractive by providing owners with the ability to take advantage of vacation experiences in addition to stays at its resorts. Bluegreen\u2019s participation in the RCI exchange network allows Vacation Club owners to use their points to stay at over 4,200 participating resorts, based upon availability and the payment of a variable exchange fee. During the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 9% of Vacation Club owners utilized the RCI exchange network for a stay of two or more nights. Bluegreen also has an exclusive strategic arrangement with Choice Hotels pursuant to which, subject to payments and conditions, certain of its resorts have been branded as part of Choice Hotels\u2019 Ascend Hotel Collection. Vacation Club owners can convert their Vacation Club points into Choice Privileges points. Choice Privileges points can be used for stays at Choice Hotels\u2019 properties. For a nominal annual fee and transactional fees, Vacation Club owners may also participate in Bluegreen\u2019s Traveler Plus program, which enables them to use points to access an additional 46 direct exchange resorts and for other vacation experiences such as cruises. In addition, Traveler Plus members can directly use their Vacation Club points for stays at Choice Hotels\u2019 Ascend Hotel Collection properties, a network of historic and boutique hotels in the United States, Canada, Scandinavia and Latin America. Bluegreen may not be able to or desire to continue to participate in the RCI or direct exchange networks in the future or maintain or extend its other marketing and strategic networks, alliances and relationships. In addition, these networks, alliances and relationships, and Bluegreen\u2019s Traveler Plus program, may not continue to operate effectively, and Bluegreen\u2019s customers may not be satisfied with them. In addition, Bluegreen may not be successful in identifying or entering into new strategic relationships in the future. If any of these events should occur, Bluegreen\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted.\nIf maintenance fees at Bluegreen\u2019s resorts and/or Vacation Club dues are required to be increased, Bluegreen\u2019s product could become less attractive, defaults could increase and its business could be harmed.\nThe maintenance fees, special assessments and Vacation Club dues that are levied by HOAs and the Vacation Club on VOI owners may increase as the costs to maintain and refurbish properties, and to keep properties in compliance with Bluegreen\u2019s standards and applicable regulations, increase. Increases in such fees, assessments or dues could negatively affect customer satisfaction with its Vacation Club or otherwise adversely impact VOI sales to both new customers and existing VOI owners or could contribute to additional defaults.\nBluegreen\u2019s strategic transactions and relationships may not be successful and may divert its management\u2019s attention and consume significant resources.\nBluegreen intends to continue its strategy of selectively pursuing complementary strategic transactions and relationships. Bluegreen may also purchase management contracts, including from resort operators facing financial distress, and purchase VOI inventory at resorts that it does not manage, with the goal of acquiring sufficient VOI\nownership at such a resort to become the manager of that resort. The successful execution of this strategy will depend on Bluegreen\u2019s ability to identify and enter into the agreements necessary to take advantage of these potential opportunities, and to obtain any necessary financing. Bluegreen may not be able to do so successfully. In addition, Bluegreen\u2019s management may be required to devote substantial time and resources to pursue these opportunities, which may divert their attention away from Bluegreen\u2019s other operations.\nAcquisitions and new strategic relationships involve numerous additional risks, including: (i) difficulty in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business or assets; (ii) potential disruption of Bluegreen\u2019s ongoing business and the distraction of management from its day-to-day operations; (iii) difficulty entering markets and relationships in which Bluegreen has limited or no prior experience and in which competitors have a stronger market position; (iv) difficulty maintaining the quality of services that Bluegreen historically provided across new acquisitions; (v) potential legal and financial responsibility for liabilities of the acquired business or assets; (vi) potential overpayment in connection with transactions; (vii) increased expenses associated with transactions or an acquisition and amortizing any acquired intangible assets; (viii) risks associated with any debt incurred in connection with the financing of transaction; and (ix) challenges in implementing uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies throughout an acquired business.\nBluegreen is dependent on the managers of resorts not managed, owned or operated by Bluegreen to ensure that those properties meet its customers\u2019 expectations.\nIn addition to stays at Bluegreen\u2019s resorts, Vacation Club owners have access to other resorts and hotels as a result of Bluegreen\u2019s participation in exchange programs and its other strategic alliances. Accordingly, Vacation Club owners have access to resorts that Bluegreen does not manage, own or operate. If those resorts are not maintained in a manner consistent with Bluegreen\u2019s standards of quality or its Vacation Club owners are otherwise dissatisfied with those resorts, Bluegreen may be subject to customer complaints and its reputation and brand could be damaged. In addition, Bluegreen\u2019s agreements with these resorts or their owners may expire, be terminated or not be renewed, or may be renegotiated in a manner adverse to Bluegreen, and Bluegreen may be unable to enter into new agreements that provide Vacation Club owners with equivalent access to additional resorts, any or all of which could materially adversely impact its business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe resale market for VOIs could adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s business.\nBluegreen believes that resales of VOIs in the secondary market generally are made at net sales prices below the original customer purchase prices. The relatively lower sales prices are partly attributable to the high marketing and sales costs associated with the initial sales of such VOIs. Accordingly, the initial purchase price of a VOI may be less attractive to prospective buyers and Bluegreen may compete with buyers who seek to resell their VOIs. While VOI resale clearing houses or brokers currently do not have a material impact on Bluegreen\u2019s business, the availability of resale VOIs at lower prices, particularly if an organized and liquid secondary market develops, could adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s level of sales and sales prices, which in turn would adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBluegreen\u2019s insurance policies do not cover all potential losses.\nBluegreen maintains insurance coverage for liability, property and other risks with respect to its operations and activities. While Bluegreen has comprehensive property and liability insurance policies with coverage features and insured limits that it believes are customary, some losses cannot be insured against and market forces beyond Bluegreen\u2019s control may limit the scope of the insurance coverage it can obtain or its ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates. The cost of insurance may increase and Bluegreen\u2019s coverage levels may decrease, which may affect its ability to maintain customary insurance coverage and deductibles at acceptable costs.\nThere is a limit as well as various sub-limits on the amount of insurance proceeds Bluegreen will receive in excess of applicable deductibles. If an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of its properties, the claims from each affected property may be considered together to determine whether the individual occurrence limit, annual aggregate limit or sub-limits, depending on the type of claim, have been reached. If the limits or sub-limits are exceeded, each affected property may only receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy. Further, certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods,\nterrorist acts, and certain environmental matters, may be outside the general coverage limits of Bluegreen\u2019s policies, subject to large deductibles, deemed uninsurable or too cost-prohibitive to justify insuring against. In addition, in the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage Bluegreen carries may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of the affected resort or in some cases may not provide a recovery for any part of a loss. As a result, Bluegreen could lose some or all of the capital it has invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future marketing, sales or revenue opportunities from the property. Further, Bluegreen could remain obligated under guarantees or other financial obligations related to the property despite the loss of product inventory, and its VOI owners could be required to contribute toward deductibles to help cover losses.\nBluegreen\u2019s business may be adversely impacted by negative publicity, including information spread through social media.\nThe proliferation and global reach of social media continues to expand rapidly and could cause us to suffer reputational harm. The continuing evolution of social media presents new challenges and requires Bluegreen to keep pace with new developments, technology and trends. Negative posts or comments about Bluegreen, the properties it manages or its brands on any social networking or user-generated review website, including travel and vacation property websites, could affect consumer opinions of Bluegreen and its products, and Bluegreen cannot guarantee that it will timely or adequately redress such instances.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Indebtedness\nChanges to and replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the results of operations and liquidity.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the regulatory authority over LIBOR) stated they will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of LIBOR interest rate indices after 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternate reference rate. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to LIBOR for promissory notes or other contracts that are currently indexed to LIBOR. The ARRC has proposed a market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR and organizations are currently working on transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. Although VOIs notes receivable are not indexed to LIBOR, as of December 31, 2021, the Company had $170.9 million of LIBOR indexed junior subordinated debentures, $74.8 million of LIBOR indexed receivable-backed notes payable and lines of credit and $98.1 million of LIBOR indexed lines of credit and notes payable (which are not receivable-backed) maturing in 2022 and after. In February 2022, the Company amended and restated $98.1 million of its LIBOR indexed lines of credit and notes payable to bear interest at rate of term SOFR plus 1.75-2.50% and a 0.50%- 0.10% credit spread adjustment. The Company is evaluating the potential impact that the eventual replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate could have on its results of operations and liquidity.\nThe Company\u2019s existing indebtedness, or indebtedness that it may incur in the future, could adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations, and the terms of its indebtedness may limit its activities.\nThe Company\u2019s level of debt and debt service requirements have several important effects on its operations. Significant debt service cash requirements reduce the funds available for operations and future business opportunities and increase the vulnerability of the Company to adverse economic and industry conditions, as well as conditions in the credit markets generally. In addition, the Company\u2019s leverage position increases its vulnerability to economic and competitive pressures and may limit funds available for acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, and other general corporate purposes. If new debt or other liabilities are added to the Company\u2019s current debt levels, the related risks that it faces could intensify. Further, the financial covenants and other restrictions contained in indentures, credit agreements and other agreements relating to the Company\u2019s indebtedness require it to meet certain financial tests and may limit its ability to, among other things, pay dividends, borrow additional funds, dispose of assets or make investments. If the Company\u2019s fails to comply with the terms of its debt instruments, such debt may become due and payable immediately, which would have a material adverse impact on its cash position and financial condition. Significant resources may be required to monitor compliance with debt instruments (from a quantitative and qualitative perspective), and such monitoring efforts may not be effective in all cases. The Company may also incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future.\nTo the extent inflationary trends, tightened credit markets or other factors affect interest rates, the Company\u2019s debt service costs may increase. If interest rates increased one percentage point, the effect on interest expense related to the Company\u2019s variable-rate debt would be an annual increase of\u2009$2.8 million, based on balances as of December 31, 2021.\nThe Company or its subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness.\n\ufeff\nThe Company and its subsidiaries have in the past and may in the future incur significant amounts of debt. Further, additional indebtedness could have important effects on the Company, including that debt service requirements will reduce cash available for operations, future investment and acquisition opportunities and payments of dividends, if any, and that increased leverage could impact the Company\u2019s liquidity and increase its vulnerability to adverse economic or market conditions. Additionally, agreements relating to additional indebtedness could contain financial covenants and other restrictions limiting the Company\u2019s operations and its ability to pay dividends, borrow additional funds or acquire or dispose of assets, and expose the Company to the risks of being in default of such covenants.\nRisks Related to the Real Estate Industry and Real Estate Development\nThe Company is subject to the risks of the real estate market and the risks associated with real estate development, including a decline in real estate values and a deterioration of other conditions relating to the real estate market and real estate development.\nReal estate markets are cyclical in nature and highly sensitive to changes in national and regional economic conditions, including:\n\uf0b7levels of unemployment;\n\uf0b7levels of discretionary disposable income;\n\uf0b7levels of consumer confidence;\n\uf0b7the availability of financing;\n\uf0b7overbuilding or decreases in demand;\n\uf0b7interest rates; and\n\uf0b7federal, state and local taxation methods.\nA deterioration in general economic conditions or in the real estate market would have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company expects to seek to acquire more real estate inventory in the future. The availability of land for development of resort properties at favorable prices will be critical to the Company\u2019s profitability and the ability to cover its significant selling, general and administrative expenses, cost of capital and other expenses. If the Company is unable to acquire such land or resort properties at a favorable cost, the Company\u2019s results of operations may be materially, adversely impacted. The profitability of the Company\u2019s real estate development activities is also impacted by the cost of construction, including the supply of good, costs of materials and labor and other services. Should the cost of construction materials and services rise, the ultimate cost of Bluegreen\u2019s future resorts inventory when developed could increase and have a material, adverse impact on its results of operations. The Company is also exposed to other risks associated with development activities, including, without limitation:\n\uf0b7adverse conditions in the capital markets may limit its ability to raise capital for completion of projects or for development of future properties;\n\uf0b7construction delays, zoning and other local, state or federal governmental approvals, cost overruns, lender financial defaults, or natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, volcanic eruptions and oil spills, increasing overall construction costs, affecting timing of project completion or resulting in project cancellations;\n\uf0b7any liability or alleged liability or resulting delays associated with latent defects in design or construction of projects developed or constructed in the future adversely affecting its business, financial condition and reputation;\n\uf0b7failure by third-party contractors to perform for any reason, exposing it to operational, reputational and financial harm; and\n\uf0b7the existence of any title defects in properties it acquires.\nIn addition, the third-party developers from whom Bluegreen sources VOI inventory are exposed to such development-related risks and, therefore, the occurrence of such risks may adversely impact Bluegreen\u2019s ability to acquire VOI inventory from them when expected or at all.\nEnvironmental liabilities, including claims with respect to mold or hazardous or toxic substances, could have a material adverse impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nUnder various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, as well as common law, the Company may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances, including mold, located on, in or emanating from property that it owns, leases or operates, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage at such property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether Bluegreen knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to sell or lease its property or to borrow money using such property or receivables generated from the sale of such property as collateral. Noncompliance with environmental, health or safety requirements may require Bluegreen to cease or alter operations at one or more of its properties. Further, the Company may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from violations of environmental regulations or from contamination associated with one or more of its properties.\nRisks Related to Technology, Privacy and Intellectual Property Rights\nFailure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in faulty business decisions or operational inefficiencies, damage the Company\u2019s reputation and/or subject the Company to costs, fines or lawsuits.\nBluegreen collects and retains large volumes of internal and customer data, including social security numbers, credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of its customers in various internal information systems and information systems of its service providers. Bluegreen also maintains personally identifiable information about its employees. The integrity and protection of that customer, employee and company data is critical to Bluegreen. Bluegreen could make faulty decisions if that data is inaccurate or incomplete. Bluegreen\u2019s customers and employees also have a high expectation that Bluegreen and its service providers will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment as well as the requirements imposed on Bluegreen by the payment card industry surrounding information, security and privacy is also increasingly demanding, in both the United States and other jurisdictions in which Bluegreen operates. Bluegreen\u2019s systems may be unable to satisfy changing regulatory and payment card industry requirements and employee and customer expectations, or may require significant additional investments or time in order to do so.\nBluegreen\u2019s information systems and records, including those Bluegreen maintains with its service providers, may be subject to security breaches, cyber-attacks, system failures, viruses, operator error or inadvertent releases of data. A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, employee or company data maintained by Bluegreen or by a service provider could adversely impact its reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses, fines or litigation. A breach in the security of Bluegreen\u2019s information systems or those of its service providers could lead to an interruption in the operation of its systems, resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits.\nThe cost involved in updating technology may be significant, and the failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair Bluegreen\u2019s operations or competitive position.\nThe vacation ownership and hospitality industries require the utilization of technology and systems, including technology utilized for sales and marketing, mortgage servicing, property management, brand assurance and compliance, and reservation systems. This technology requires continuous updating and refinements, including technology required to remain competitive and to comply with the legal requirements such as privacy regulations and requirements established by third parties. Bluegreen is taking steps to update its information technology platform,\nwhich has required, and is likely to continue to require, significant capital expenditures. Older systems which have not yet been updated may increase the risk of operational inefficiencies, financial loss and non-compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and it may not be successful in updating such systems in the time frame or at the cost anticipated. Further, as a result of the rapidly changing technological environment, systems which Bluegreen has put in place or expect to put in place in the near term may become outdated requiring new technology, and it may not be able to replace those systems as quickly as its competition or within budgeted costs and time frames. Further, Bluegreen may not achieve the benefits that may have been anticipated from any new technology or system.\nIn addition, conversions to new information technology systems require effective change management processes and may result in cost overruns, delays or business interruptions. If Bluegreen\u2019s information technology systems are disrupted, become obsolete or do not adequately support its strategic, operational or compliance needs, Bluegreen\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected.\nBluegreen\u2019s intellectual property rights, and the intellectual property rights of its business partners, are valuable, and the failure to protect those rights could have a significant adverse effect.\nBluegreen\u2019s intellectual property rights, including existing and future trademarks, trade secrets and copyrights, are and will continue to be valuable and important assets of its business. Bluegreen believes that its proprietary technology, as well as Bluegreen\u2019s other technologies and business practices, are competitive advantages and that any duplication by competitors would harm its business. Measures taken to protect Bluegreen\u2019s intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective. Additionally, intellectual property laws and contractual restrictions may not prevent misappropriation of Bluegreen\u2019s intellectual property. Finally, even if Bluegreen is able to successfully protect its intellectual property, others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to its technology. Bluegreen also generates a significant portion of its new sales prospects and leads through arrangements with third parties, including Bass Pro. The failure by Bluegreen or these third parties to protect their intellectual property rights could have a significant adverse effect.\nGeneral Risks\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of the Company\u2019s results.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock may be volatile due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond its control, including those discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and under \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d as well as the following:\n\uf0b7the failure of securities analysts to cover the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, or changes in financial estimates by analysts;\n\uf0b7the inability to meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock;\n\uf0b7strategic actions by the Company or its competitors;\n\uf0b7risks related to the Company\u2019s business and industry, including announcements by the Company or its competitors of significant issues or significant acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures or other transactions;\n\uf0b7introduction of new products or services by Bluegreen or its competitors;\n\uf0b7variations in the Company\u2019s quarterly operating results and those of its competitors, including seasonal fluctuations;\n\uf0b7additions or departures of key personnel;\n\uf0b7general economic and stock market conditions;\n\uf0b7changes in conditions or trends in its industry, markets or customers;\n\uf0b7regulatory and legal proceedings, investigations and developments;\n\uf0b7political developments;\n\uf0b7changes in accounting principles;\n\uf0b7changes in tax legislation and regulations;\n\uf0b7terrorist acts;\n\uf0b7accumulation of publicly held shares and the timing and amount of future purchase or sales of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock or other securities;\n\uf0b7defaults under agreements governing the Company\u2019s indebtedness; and\n\uf0b7investor perceptions with respect to the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock relative to other investment alternatives.\nAdverse outcomes in legal or other regulatory proceedings, including claims of non-compliance with applicable regulations or development-related defects, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings, which result in significant expenses and devotion of time and the Company may agree to indemnify third parties or its strategic partners from damages or losses associated with such risks. In addition, litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse outcomes could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nBluegreen engages third-party contractors to construct its resorts. However, customers may assert claims against Bluegreen for construction defects or other perceived development defects, including, without limitation, structural integrity, the presence of mold as a result of leaks or other defects, water intrusion, asbestos, electrical issues, plumbing issues, road construction, water and sewer defects and defects in the engineering of amenities. In addition, certain state and local laws may impose liability on property developers with respect to development defects discovered in the future. Bluegreen could have to accrue a significant portion of the cost to repair such defects in the quarter when such defects arise or when the repair costs are reasonably estimable.\nCosts associated with litigation, including claims for development-related defects, and the outcomes thereof could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial condition and operating results.\nThe loss of the services of key management and personnel could adversely affect the business. In addition, labor shortages and increased labor cost could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nThe success of the Company will depend on its ability to attract and retain experienced and knowledgeable management and other professional staff, and it may not be successful in doing so. If its efforts to retain and attract key management and other personnel are unsuccessful, the Company business, prospects, and results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted.\nLabor is one of the primary components of operating our business. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase our labor costs, including high unemployment levels, federal unemployment subsidies, including unemployment benefits offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and other government regulations. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates, whether caused by COVID-19 or as a result of general macroeconomic or other factors, could, among other things, (i) lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime pay to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, (ii) negatively affect the operation of our resorts and our guest\u2019s satisfaction with our resorts and, in turn, lead to negative public perception, or (iii) otherwise adversely impact our business and results. Further, mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability or an increase in labor costs may be unsuccessful and could have negative effects.\nThere are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Any changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions used could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and assumptions include, but are not limited to, those related to future cash flows, which in turn are based upon expectations of future performance given current and projected forecasts of the economy in general and the real estate markets. If any estimates, judgments or assumptions change in the future, including in the event that the Company\u2019s performance does not otherwise meet its expectations, the Company may be required to record impairment charges against its earnings, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition. In addition, GAAP requirements as to how certain estimates are\nmade may result, for example, in asset valuations which ultimately would not be realized if the Company were to attempt to sell the asset.\nIf the Company fails to maintain proper and effective internal controls, the Company\u2019s ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm its operating results, the Company\u2019s ability to operate its business and its reputation.\nThe Company is required to maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting and to provide annual management reports on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Ensuring that the Company has adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that the Company can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Substantial work and expenses may continue to be required to implement, document, assess, test and, as necessary, remediate the Company\u2019s system of internal controls.\nIf the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting are not effective, if the Company is not able to issue its financial statements in a timely manner or if the Company is not able to obtain the required audit or review of its financial statements by the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm in a timely manner, the Company will not be able to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and the listing requirements of the NYSE. If these events occur, the listing of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock on the NYSE could be suspended or terminated and the Company\u2019s stock price could materially suffer. In addition, the Company or members of its management could be subject to investigation and sanction by the SEC and other regulatory authorities and to shareholder lawsuits, which could impose significant additional costs on the Company and divert management attention.", "PERMNO": 89735, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "BBX"}
