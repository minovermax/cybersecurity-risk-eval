{"cik": "708781", "company": "CASS INFORMATION SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThis section highlights specific risks that could affect the Company\u2019s business. Although this section attempts to highlight key factors, please be aware that other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time, and Cass cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect the Company\u2019s financial performance. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere or incorporated by reference in this report, the identified risks that could cause actual results to differ materially include the following:\nGeneral political, economic or industry conditions may be less favorable than expected.\nLocal, domestic, and international economic, political and industry-specific conditions and governmental monetary and fiscal policies affect the industries in which the Company competes, directly and indirectly. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, volatile interest rates, tight money supply, real estate values, international conflicts and other factors outside of Cass\u2019 control may adversely affect the Company. Economic downturns could result in the delinquency of outstanding loans, which could have a material adverse impact on Cass\u2019 earnings.\nUnfavorable developments concerning customer credit quality could affect Cass\u2019 financial results.\nAlthough the Company regularly reviews credit exposure related to its customers and various industry sectors in which it has business relationships, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. Under such circumstances, the Company could experience an increase in the level of provision for credit losses, delinquencies, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and allowance for credit losses.\nThe Company has lending concentrations, including, but not limited to, faith-based ministries located in selected cities and privately-held businesses located in or near St. Louis, Missouri, that could suffer a significant decline which could adversely affect the Company.\nCass\u2019 customer base consists, in part, of lending concentrations in several segments and geographical areas. If any of these segments or areas is significantly affected by weak economic conditions, the Company could experience increased credit losses, and its business could be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in interest rates could affect Cass\u2019 net interest income and balance sheet.\nThe operations of financial institutions such as the Company are dependent to a large degree on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Prevailing economic conditions, the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest, which in turn significantly affect financial institutions\u2019 net interest income. Fluctuations in interest rates affect Cass\u2019 financial statements, as they do for all financial institutions. Volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation, which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments, such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles, which, because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements, generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,\u201d a low level of interest rates would have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s net interest income.\nThe Company may be adversely impacted by the uncertainty regarding LIBOR as a reference rate.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced in 2017 that after 2021 it would no longer persuade or require banks to submit the rates required to calculate the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot be guaranteed after 2021 and has resulted in uncertainty about the future of LIBOR and what may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR. At this time, the Company is not able to predict the effect of this uncertainty on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments.\nRegulators, industry groups and certain committees (e.g., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have, among other things, published recommended fall-back language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these specific recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments.\nCertain of Cass\u2019 loans and other financial instruments include attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR could create considerable costs and additional risk. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition will change Cass\u2019 market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact the Company\u2019s reputation. Although Cass is currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperational difficulties or cyber-security problems could damage Cass\u2019 reputation and business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company depends on the reliable operation of its computer operations and network connections from its clients to its systems. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security of these systems would cause Cass to be unable to process transactions for its clients, resulting in decreased revenues. The Company also relies on electronic communications and information systems to store sensitive customer data. Any failure, interruption, breach in security or loss of data, whatever the cause, could reduce client satisfaction with the Company\u2019s products and services and harm Cass\u2019 financial results. These types of threats may derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. Further, to access the Company\u2019s products and services, Cass\u2019 customers may use computers and mobile devices that are beyond the Company\u2019s security control systems. The Company\u2019s technologies, systems, networks and software, and those of other financial institutions have been, and are likely to continue to be, the target of cybersecurity threats and attacks, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at Cass. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. A material security problem affecting Cass could damage its reputation, deter prospects from purchasing its products and services, deter customers from using its products and services or result in liability to Cass.\nCloud technologies are also critical to the operation of our systems, and our reliance on cloud technologies is growing. Service disruptions in cloud technologies may lead to delays in accessing, or the loss of, data that is important to our businesses and may hinder our customers\u2019 access to our products and services.\nAlthough the Company makes significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of Cass\u2019 information systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that Cass\u2019 security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber-attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible to entirely mitigate this risk. While specific \u201ccyber\u201d insurance coverage is maintained, which would apply in the event of various breach scenarios, the amount of coverage may not be adequate in any particular case. Furthermore, because cyber threat scenarios are inherently difficult to predict and can take many forms, some breaches may not be covered under Cass\u2019 cyber insurance coverage. A security breach or other significant disruption of Cass\u2019 information systems or those related to customers, merchants and third party vendors, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could 1) disrupt the proper functioning of Cass\u2019 networks and systems and therefore operations and/or those of certain customers; 2) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of the Company or its customers; 3) result in a violation of applicable privacy, data breach and other laws, subjecting the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny and expose Cass to civil litigation, governmental fines and possible financial liability; 4) require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; or 5) harm Cass\u2019 reputation or cause a decrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with the Company. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on Cass\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCass must respond to rapid technological changes and these changes may be more difficult or expensive than anticipated.\nIf competitors introduce new products and services embodying new technologies, or if new industry standards and practices emerge, the Company\u2019s existing product and service offerings, technology and systems may become obsolete. Further, if Cass fails to adopt or develop new technologies or to adapt its products and services to emerging industry standards, Cass may lose current and future customers. Finally, Cass\u2019 ability to adopt these technologies can also be inhibited by intellectual property rights of third parties. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. The payment processing and financial services industries are changing rapidly and in order to remain competitive, Cass must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of its products, services and technologies. These changes may be more difficult or expensive than the Company anticipates.\nOperations of the Company\u2019s customer base are impacted by macro-economic factors such as a strong dollar and/or volatility in commodity prices. A reduction in its customers\u2019 operations could have a material adverse effect on Cass\u2019 results of operations.\nA decline in the cost of oil worldwide can have a negative effect on both the number of freight transactions processed and the dollar amount of invoices processed. For example, lower oil prices can cause a significant drop in drilling supplies being transported to fracking operations by domestic railroads and trucks. Lower oil prices can also result in lower gas and fuel prices, negatively affecting the dollar amounts of the invoices that Cass processes for its freight and shipping customers. A decline in oil prices could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenues and could significantly impact its results of operations.\nMethods of reducing risk exposures might not be effective.\nInstruments, systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit, interest rate, market and liquidity, operational, regulatory/compliance, business risks and enterprise-wide risks could be less effective than anticipated. As a result, the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk.\nCustomer borrowing, repayment, investment, deposit, and payable processing practices may be different than anticipated.\nThe Company uses a variety of financial tools, models and other methods to anticipate customer behavior as part of its strategic and financial planning and to meet certain regulatory requirements. Individual, economic, political and industry-specific conditions and other factors outside of Cass\u2019 control could alter predicted customer borrowing, repayment, investment, deposit, and payable processing practices. Such a change in these practices could adversely affect Cass\u2019 ability to anticipate business needs, including cash flow and its impact on liquidity, and to meet regulatory requirements.\nCass\u2019 stock price can become volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price can fluctuate based on factors that can include actual or anticipated variations in Cass\u2019 quarterly results; new technology or services by competitors; unanticipated losses or gains due to unexpected events, including losses or gains on securities held for investment purposes; significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving the Company or its competitors; changes in accounting policies or practices; failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions; or changes in government regulations.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, governmental intervention, interest rate changes, credit loss trends, low trading volume or currency fluctuations also could cause Cass\u2019 stock price to decrease regardless of the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses is subject to continuing evaluation and may be insufficient.\nThe Company maintains an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. Management uses a systematic, documented approach in determining the appropriate level of the\nallowance for loan losses reserve, which represents management\u2019s best estimate of inherent losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, such as review of industry concentrations; specific credit risks and financial conditions of specific borrowers; loan loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires management to make estimates based on risks and trends that are subject to material change. Continuing deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, some of which are outside of the Company\u2019s control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs based on judgments different than those of management. If charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, the Company will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, as amended, on January 1, 2020 will impact the Company\u2019s methodology for estimating the allowance for loan losses.\nSee Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d and Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 1\u201d for additional information.\nCompetitive product and pricing pressure within Cass\u2019 markets may change.\nThe Company operates in a very competitive environment, which is characterized by competition from a number of other vendors and financial institutions in each market in which it operates. The Company competes with large payment processors and national and regional financial institutions and also smaller auditing companies and banks in terms of products and pricing. If the Company is unable to compete effectively in products and pricing in its markets, business could decline.\nManagement\u2019s ability to maintain and expand customer relationships may differ from expectations.\nThe industries in which the Company operates are very competitive. The Company not only competes for business opportunities with new customers, but also competes to maintain and expand the relationships it has with its existing customers. The Company continues to experience pressures to maintain these relationships as its competitors attempt to capture its customers.\nThe introduction, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and strategies, including, but not limited to, the expansion of payment and processing activities to new markets, the expansion of products and services to existing markets and opening of new bank branches, may be less successful or may be different than anticipated. Such a result could adversely affect Cass\u2019 business.\nThe Company makes certain projections as a basis for developing plans and strategies for its payment processing and banking products. If the Company does not accurately determine demand for its products and services, it could result in the Company incurring significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue, which could result in an adverse effect on its earnings.\nIn addition, there are risks and uncertainties associated with the introduction of new products and services, including substantial investments of time and resources. The introduction and development of new products and services may not be achieved along expected timelines, or at all, and may not be successful as a result of factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including regulatory, competition and external market factors. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new products or services, and failure to integrate such new products and services into our existing system of internal controls, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nManagement\u2019s ability to retain key officers and employees may change.\nCass\u2019 future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of Cass\u2019 executive officers and key personnel. Cass\u2019 future operating results also depend in significant part upon Cass\u2019 ability to attract and retain qualified management, financial, technical, marketing, sales, and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and the Company cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and it may be increasingly difficult for the Company to hire personnel over time. Cass\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or by Cass\u2019 inability to attract and retain skilled employees.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and possible enforcement or other legal actions that could detrimentally affect Cass\u2019 business.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, the primary focus of which is to protect customers, depositors, the deposit insurance fund and the safety and soundness of the banking system as a whole, and not shareholders. In addition, since the global financial crisis, financial institutions generally have been subject to increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities, with an increased focus on risk management and consumer compliance. This regulatory structure and heightened focus gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies or guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by federal and state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, revocation of a banking charter, and other regulatory sanctions, as well as reputational damage, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCongress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. The substance and impact of pending or future legislation or regulation, or the application thereof, cannot be predicted, although any change could impact the regulatory structure under which the Company or its competitors operate and may significantly increase costs, impede the efficiency of internal business processes, require an increase in regulatory capital, require modifications to the Company\u2019s business strategy, and/or limit its ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries could have a material, adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSee Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Supervision and Regulation,\u201d and Item 8, Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nThe Company may need to raise additional capital or sell assets if it fails to meet regulatory capital requirements or meet commitments and liquidity needs. Such capital may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.\nFully phased in, the Basel III Capital rules implemented stricter capital requirements and leverage limits and methods for calculating risk-weighted assets, meaning the Company is required to hold more capital against such assets. Complying with these more stringent capital requirements could result in management modifying its business strategy and could limit the Company\u2019s ability to make distributions, including paying dividends, or buying back shares.\nThe Company may also need to raise additional capital in the future to provide it with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet commitments and business needs. The ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time and the Company\u2019s financial condition, as well as the need for other financial institutions to raise capital at the same time. Economic conditions and the loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase the cost of funding and limit access to certain customary sources of capital, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the Federal Reserve.\nAn inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal and regulatory proceedings and related matters with respect to the financial services industry, including those directly involving the Company and its subsidiaries, could adversely affect Cass or the financial services industry in general.\nThe Company is subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings. It is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in any proceeding or litigation. Any such matter could result in substantial cost and diversion of Cass\u2019 efforts, which by itself could have a material adverse effect on Cass\u2019 financial condition and operating results. Further, adverse determinations in such matters could result in actions by Cass\u2019 regulators that could materially adversely affect Cass\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations. Please refer to Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nThe Company\u2019s accounting policies and methods are the basis of how Cass reports its financial condition and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. In addition, changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or other authoritative bodies, could materially impact Cass\u2019 financial statements.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how Cass records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. Management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods in order to ensure that they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management\u2019s judgment as to the most appropriate manner in which to record and report Cass\u2019 financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances yet might result in the Company reporting materially different amounts than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCass has identified one accounting policy as being \u201ccritical\u201d to the presentation of its financial condition and results of operations because they require management to make particularly subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. More information on Cass\u2019 critical accounting policies is contained in Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nFrom time to time, the regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), and other authoritative bodies change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how management records and reports the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to liquidity risk.\nThe Company requires liquidity to meet deposit and accounts and drafts payable obligations as they come due. Access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance the Company\u2019s commitments and business activities or on terms that are acceptable or favorable to the Company could be impaired by risks and uncertainties that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including those described in this Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nThe Company\u2019s access to deposits and accounts and drafts payable for liquidity purposes may also be adversely affected by the needs of the Company\u2019s depositors and customers. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCass is subject to examinations and challenges by tax authorities, which, if not resolved in the Company\u2019s favor, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the normal course of business, Cass and its affiliates are routinely subject to examinations and challenges from federal and state tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments it has made and the businesses in which it is engaged. Recently, federal and state taxing authorities have become increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions. These tax positions may relate to tax compliance, sales and use, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base, apportionment and tax credit planning. The challenges made by tax authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in the Company\u2019s favor, they could have an adverse effect on Cass\u2019 financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain events beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as severe weather, natural disasters, terrorist activities or other hostilities, may adversely affect the general economy, financial and capital markets, specific industries, and the Company.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of terrorism or other hostilities, and other adverse external events beyond the Company\u2019s control, could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business. Such events could disrupt Cass\u2019 operations or those of its customers, affect the stability of the Bank\u2019s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. The occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 83738, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "CASS"}
