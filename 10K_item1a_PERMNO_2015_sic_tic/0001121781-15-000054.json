{"cik": "924515", "company": "GUIDED THERAPEUTICS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us.\nAlthough we will be required to raise additional funds during the second quarter of 2015, there is no assurance that such funds can be raised on terms that we would find acceptable, on a timely basis, or at all.\nAdditional debt or equity financing will be required for us to continue as a going concern. We may seek to obtain additional funds for the financing of our cervical cancer detection business through additional debt or equity financings and/or new collaborative arrangements. Management believes that additional financing, if obtainable, will be sufficient to support planned operations only for a limited period. Management has implemented operating actions to reduce cash requirements. Any required additional funding may not be available on terms attractive to us, on a timely basis, or at all.\nIf we cannot obtain additional funds or achieve profitability, we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nBecause we must obtain additional funds through further financing transactions or through new collaborative arrangements in order to grow the revenues of our cervical cancer detection product line, there exists substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, it will be necessary to raise additional funds. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise these additional funds. If we do not secure additional funding when needed, we will be unable to conduct all of our product development efforts as planned, which may cause us to alter our business plan in relation to the development of our products. Even if we obtain additional funding, we will need to achieve profitability thereafter.\nOur independent registered public accountants\u2019 report on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, indicated that there was substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern because we had suffered recurring losses from operations and had an accumulated deficit of $113.1 million at December 31, 2014, summarized as follows:\nAccumulated deficit, from inception to 12/31/2012 $ 92.1 million\nNet Loss for fiscal year 2013, ended 12/31/2013 $ 7.2 million\nDeemed dividends for fiscal year 2013, ended 12/31/2013 $ 3.7 million\nAccumulated deficit, from inception to 12/31/2013 $103.0 million\nPreferred dividends $ 0.2 million\nNet Loss for fiscal year 2014, ended 12/31/2014 $ 9.9 million\nAccumulated deficit, from inception to 12/31/2014 $113.1 million\nOur management has implemented reductions in operating expenditures and reductions in some development activities. We have determined to make cervical cancer detection the focus of our business. We are managing the development of our other programs only when funds are made available to us via grants or contracts with government entities or strategic partners. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement or continue these plans.\nIf we cannot obtain additional funds when needed, we will not be able to implement our business plan.\nWe will require substantial additional capital to develop our products, including completing product testing and clinical trials, obtaining all required regulatory approvals and clearances, beginning and scaling up manufacturing, and marketing our products. We have historically financed our operations though the private sale of preferred stock and debt securities, public and private sales of common stock, funding from collaborative arrangements, and grants. We believe funds on hand as of date of this report, along with funds from government contracts and grants; will be sufficient to support planned operations through the first quarter of 2015. Any failure to achieve adequate funding in a timely fashion would delay our development programs and could lead to abandonment of one or more of our development initiatives. To the extent we cannot obtain additional funding, our ability to continue to develop and introduce products to market will be limited. Further, financing our operations through the public or private sale of debt or equity may involve restrictive covenants or other provisions that could limit how we conduct our business or finance our operations. Financing our operations through collaborative arrangements generally means that the obligations of the collaborative partner to fund our expenditures are largely discretionary and depend on a number of factors, including our ability to meet specified milestones in the development and testing of the relevant product. We may not be able to obtain an acceptable collaboration partner, and even if we do, we may not be able to meet these milestones, or the collaborative partner may not continue to fund our expenditures.\nWe do not have a long operating history, especially in the cancer detection field, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business.\nAlthough we have been in existence since 1992, we have recently begun the process of commercializing our cervical cancer detection technology. Because limited historical information is available on our revenue trends and operations for our cancer detection programs it is difficult to evaluate our business. Our prospects must be considered in light of the substantial risks, expenses, uncertainties and difficulties encountered by entrants into the medical device industry, which is characterized by increasing intense competition and a high failure rate.\nWe have a history of losses, and we expect losses to continue.\nWe have never been profitable and we have had operating losses since our inception. We expect our operating losses to continue as we continue to expend substantial resources to complete development of our products, obtain regulatory clearances or approvals, build our marketing, sales, manufacturing and finance organizations, and conduct further research and development. The further development and commercialization of our products will require substantial development, regulatory, sales and marketing, manufacturing and other expenditures. We have only generated limited revenues from product sales. Our accumulated deficit was approximately $113.1 million at December 31, 2014.\nOur ability to sell our products is controlled by government regulations, and we may not be able to obtain any necessary clearances or approvals.\nThe design, manufacturing, labeling, distribution and marketing of medical device products are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation, which can be expensive and uncertain and can cause lengthy delays before we can begin selling our products.\nIn the United States, the FDA\u2019s actions could delay or prevent our ability to sell our products, which would adversely affect our growth and strategy plans.\nIn order for us to market our products in the United States, we must obtain clearance or approval from the FDA. We cannot be sure that:\n\u2022 we, or any collaborative partner, will make timely filings with the FDA;\n\u2022 the FDA will act favorably or quickly on these submissions;\n\u2022 we will not be required to submit additional information or perform additional clinical studies; or\n\u2022 other significant difficulties and costs will not be encountered to obtain FDA clearance or approval.\nIt can take several years from initial filing of a PMA application and require the submission of extensive supporting data and clinical information. The FDA may impose strict labeling or other requirements as a condition of its clearance or approval, any of which could limit our ability to market our products. Further, if we wish to modify a product after FDA approval of a PMA application, including changes in indications or other modifications that could affect safety and efficacy, additional clearances or approvals will be required from the FDA. Any request by the FDA for additional data, or any requirement by the FDA that we conduct additional clinical studies, could result in a significant delay in bringing our products to market and substantial additional research and other expenditures. Similarly, any labeling or other conditions or restrictions imposed by the FDA could hinder our ability to effectively market our products. Any of the above actions by the FDA could delay or prevent altogether our ability to market and distribute our products. Further, there may be new FDA policies or changes in FDA policies that could be adverse to us.\nIn foreign countries, including European countries, we are also subject to government regulation, which could delay or prevent our ability to sell our products in those jurisdictions.\nIn order for us to market our products in Europe and some other international jurisdictions, we and our distributors and agents must obtain required regulatory registrations or approvals. We must also comply with extensive regulations regarding safety, efficacy and quality in those jurisdictions. We may not be able to obtain the required regulatory registrations or approvals, or we may be required to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining any regulatory registrations or approvals we receive. Delays in obtaining any registrations or approvals required for marketing our products, failure to receive these registrations or approvals, or future loss of previously obtained registrations or approvals would limit our ability to sell our products internationally. For example, international regulatory bodies have adopted various regulations governing product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. These regulations vary from country to country. In order to sell our products in Europe, we must maintain ISO 13485:2003 certification and CE mark certification, which is an international symbol of quality and compliance with applicable European medical device directives. Failure to maintain ISO 13485:2003 certification or CE mark certification or other international regulatory approvals would prevent us from selling in some countries in the European Union.\nEven if we obtain clearance or approval to sell our products, we are subject to ongoing requirements and inspections that could lead to the restriction, suspension or revocation of our clearance.\nWe, as well as any potential collaborative partners, will be required to adhere to applicable FDA regulations regarding good manufacturing practice, which include testing, control, and documentation requirements. We are subject to similar regulations in foreign countries. Ongoing compliance with good manufacturing practice and other applicable regulatory requirements will be strictly enforced in the United States through periodic inspections by state and federal agencies, including the FDA, and in international jurisdictions by comparable agencies. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure to obtain premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices, withdrawal of approvals previously obtained, and criminal prosecution. The restriction, suspension or revocation of regulatory approvals or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements would limit our ability to operate and could increase our costs.\nOur success largely depends on our ability to maintain and protect the proprietary information on which we base our products.\nOur success depends in large part upon our ability to maintain and protect the proprietary nature of our technology through the patent process, as well as our ability to license from others patents and patent applications necessary to develop our products. If any of our patents are successfully challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or our right or ability to manufacture our products was to be limited, our ability to continue to manufacture and market our products could be adversely affected. In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how, which we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. The other parties to these agreements may breach these provisions, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Additionally, our trade secrets could otherwise become known to or be independently developed by competitors.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we have been issued, or have rights to, 22 U.S. patents (including those under license). In addition, we have filed for, or have rights to, 6 U.S. patents (including those under license) that are still pending. There are additional international patents and pending applications. One or more of the patents we hold directly or license from third parties, including those for our cervical cancer detection products, may be successfully challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may otherwise be unable to rely on these patents. These risks are also present for the process we use or will use for manufacturing our products. In addition, our competitors, many of whom have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies, may apply for and obtain patents that prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use and sell our products, either in the United States or in international markets.\nThe medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. In addition, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, may institute interference proceedings. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, USPTO proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings are both costly and time consuming. Moreover, we may need to litigate to enforce our patents, to protect our trade secrets or know-how, or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Any litigation or interference proceedings involving us may require us to incur substantial legal and other fees and expenses and may require some of our employees to devote all or a substantial portion of their time to the proceedings. An adverse determination in the proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from selling our products in some or all markets. We may not be able to reach a satisfactory settlement of any dispute by licensing necessary patents or other intellectual property. Even if we reached a settlement, the settlement process may be expensive and time consuming, and the terms of the settlement may require us to pay substantial royalties. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or the failure to obtain a necessary license could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient sales revenues to sustain our growth and strategy plans.\nOur cervical cancer diagnostic activities have been financed to date through a combination of government grants, strategic partners and direct investment. Growing revenues for this product is the main focus of our business. In order to effectively market the cervical cancer detection product, additional capital will be needed. We need to complete the FDA filing process for our cervical cancer diagnostic product and obtain capital investment for a U.S. launch.\nAdditional product lines involve the modification of the cervical cancer detection technology for use in other cancers. These product lines are only in the earliest stages of research and development and are currently not projected to reach market for several years. Our goal is to receive enough funding from government grants and contracts, as well as payments from strategic partners, to fund development of these product lines without diverting funds or other necessary resources from the cervical cancer program.\nBecause our products, which use different technology or apply technology in different ways than other medical devices, are or will be new to the market, we may not be successful in launching our products and our operations and growth would be adversely affected.\nOur products are based on new methods of cancer detection. If our products do not achieve significant market acceptance, our sales will be limited and our financial condition may suffer. Physicians and individuals may not recommend or use our products unless they determine that these products are an attractive alternative to current tests that have a long history of safe and effective use. To date, our products have been used by only a limited number of people, and few independent studies regarding our products have been published. The lack of independent studies limits the ability of doctors or consumers to compare our products to conventional products.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively in the highly competitive medical device industry, our future growth and operating results will suffer.\nThe medical device industry in general and the markets in which we expect to offer products in particular, are intensely competitive. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, research, technical, manufacturing, marketing and distribution resources than we do and have greater name recognition and lengthier operating histories in the health care industry. We may not be able to effectively compete against these and other competitors. A number of competitors are currently marketing traditional laboratory-based tests for cervical cancer screening and diagnosis. These tests are widely accepted in the health care industry and have a long history of accurate and effective use. Further, if our products are not available at competitive prices, health care administrators who are subject to increasing pressures to reduce costs may not elect to purchase them. Also, a number of companies have announced that they are developing, or have introduced, products that permit non-invasive and less invasive cancer detection. Accordingly, competition in this area is expected to increase.\nFurthermore, our competitors may succeed in developing, either before or after the development and commercialization of our products, devices and technologies that permit more efficient, less expensive non-invasive and less invasive cancer detection. It is also possible that one or more pharmaceutical or other health care companies will develop therapeutic drugs, treatments or other products that will substantially reduce the prevalence of cancers or otherwise render our products obsolete.\nWe have little manufacturing experience, which could limit our growth.\nWe do not have manufacturing experience that would enable us to make products in the volumes that would be necessary for us to achieve significant commercial sales, and we rely upon our suppliers. In addition, we may not be able to establish and maintain reliable, efficient, full scale manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs in a timely fashion. Difficulties we encounter in manufacturing scale-up, or our failure to implement and maintain our manufacturing facilities in accordance with good manufacturing practice regulations, international quality standards or other regulatory requirements, could result in a delay or termination of production. To date, our manufacturing activities have included since-discontinued products. In addition, we are only at the initial phase of manufacturing the LuViva device. In the past, we have had substantial difficulties in establishing and maintaining manufacturing for these products and those difficulties impacted our ability to increase sales. Companies often encounter difficulties in scaling up production, including problems involving production yield, quality control and assurance, and shortages of qualified personnel.\nSince we rely on sole source suppliers for several of our products, any failure of those suppliers to perform would hurt our operations.\nSeveral of the components used in our products or planned products, are available from only one supplier, and substitutes for these components could not be obtained easily or would require substantial modifications to our products. Any significant problem experienced by one of our sole source suppliers may result in a delay or interruption in the supply of components to us until that supplier cures the problem or an alternative source of the component is located and qualified. Any delay or interruption would likely lead to a delay or interruption in our manufacturing operations. For our products that require premarket approval, the inclusion of substitute components could require us to qualify the new supplier with the appropriate government regulatory authorities. Alternatively, for our products that qualify for premarket notification, the substitute components must meet our product specifications.\nBecause we operate in an industry with significant product liability risk, and we have not specifically insured against this risk, we may be subject to substantial claims against our products.\nThe development, manufacture and sale of medical products entail significant risks of product liability claims. We currently have no product liability insurance coverage beyond that provided by our general liability insurance. Accordingly, we may not be adequately protected from any liabilities, including any adverse judgments or settlements, we might incur in connection with the development, clinical testing, manufacture and sale of our products. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us that result in an adverse judgment against or settlement by us in excess of any insurance coverage could seriously harm our financial condition or reputation. In addition, product liability insurance is expensive and may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nThe availability of third party reimbursement for our products is uncertain, which may limit consumer use and the market for our products.\nIn the United States and elsewhere, sales of medical products are dependent, in part, on the ability of consumers of these products to obtain reimbursement for all or a portion of their cost from third-party payors, such as government and private insurance plans. Any inability of patients, hospitals, physicians and other users of our products to obtain sufficient reimbursement from third-party payors for our products, or adverse changes in relevant governmental policies or the policies of private third-party payors regarding reimbursement for these products, could limit our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis. We are unable to predict what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods used by third-party health care payors. Moreover, third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and some health care providers are gradually adopting a managed care system in which the providers contract to provide comprehensive health care services for a fixed cost per person. Patients, hospitals and physicians may not be able to justify the use of our products by the attendant cost savings and clinical benefits that we believe will be derived from the use of our products, and therefore may not be able to obtain third-party reimbursement.\nReimbursement and health care payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country and include both government-sponsored health care and private insurance. We may not be able to obtain approvals for reimbursement from these international third-party payors in a timely manner, if at all. Any failure to receive international reimbursement approvals could have an adverse effect on market acceptance of our products in the international markets in which approvals are sought.\nThe loan with Tonaquint is collateralized by a general security interest in our current and future inventory and accounts receivable. If we were to default under the terms of the loan, Tonaquint would have the right to foreclose on these assets.\nOn September 10, 2014 we entered into a loan with Tonaquint, Inc. (\u201cTonaquint\u201d), to support general working capital and operations. As collateral to secure our obligations under the loan, we have granted Tonaquint a security interest in our current and future inventory and accounts receivable. When the loan is repaid, the lender\u2019s security interest on our current and future inventory and accounts receivable will be extinguished. If an event of default occurs under the loan and security agreements prior to our repayment of the loan, the lender may exercise its right to foreclose on these secured assets for the payment of these obligations. Any such default and resulting foreclosure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain scientific, technical, managerial and finance personnel.\nOur ability to operate successfully and manage our future growth depends in significant part upon the continued service of key scientific, technical, managerial and finance personnel, as well as our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel in these fields. We may not be able to attract and retain key employees when necessary, which would limit our operations and growth. Only our Chief Executive Officer and our Senior Vice President of Engineering have employment contracts with us, and none of our employees are covered by key person or similar insurance. In addition, if we are able to successfully develop and commercialize our products, we will need to hire additional scientific, technical, marketing, managerial and finance personnel. We face intense competition for qualified personnel in these areas, many of whom are often subject to competing employment offers.\nWe are significantly influenced by our directors, executive officers and their affiliated entities.\nOur directors, executive officers and entities affiliated with them beneficially owned an aggregate of about 18.1%, of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2014. These stockholders, acting together, would be able to exert significant influence on substantially all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers and other business combination transactions.\nOur stock is thinly traded, so you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all.\nThe shares of our common stock are dually listed on the OTCBB and the OTCQB. Shares of our common stock are thinly traded, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 we are a small company that is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume; and\n\u2022 stock analysts, stock brokers and institutional investors may be risk-averse and be reluctant to follow a company such as ours that faces substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern or to purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more viable.\nAs a consequence, our stock price may not reflect an actual or perceived value. Also, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer that has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. A broader or more active public trading market for our common shares may not develop or if developed, may not be sustained. Due to these conditions, you may not be able to sell your shares at or near ask prices or at all if you need money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares.\nTrading in our common stock is subject to special sales practices and may be difficult to sell.\nOur common stock is subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rule, which imposes special sales practice requirements upon broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers or accredited investors. Penny stocks are generally defined to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share. For purposes of the rule, the phrase \u201caccredited investors\u201d means, in general terms, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000, or individuals having a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or having an annual income that exceeds $200,000 (or that, when combined with a spouse\u2019s income, exceeds $300,000). For transactions covered by the rule, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, the rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and also may affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their securities in any market that might develop.\nStockholders should be aware that, according to Securities and Exchange Commission Release No. 34-29093, the market for penny stocks has suffered from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include:\n\u2022 control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer;\n\u2022 manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases;\n\u2022 \u201cboiler room\u201d practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons;\n\u2022 excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and\n\u2022 the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses.\nOur management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our common stock.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nIf our stockholders (including those persons who may become stockholders upon exercise of our warrants) sell substantial amounts of our common stock, or the public market perceives that stockholders might sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. Such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that our management deems appropriate.\nOur need to raise additional capital in the near future or to use our equity securities for payments could have a dilutive effect on your investment.\nIn order to continue operations, we will need to raise additional capital. We may attempt to raise capital through the public or private sale of our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock. In addition, from time to time we have issued our common stock or warrants in lieu of cash payments. If we sell additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities, or issue such securities in respect of other claims or indebtedness, such sales or issuances will further dilute the percentage of our equity that you own. Depending upon the price per share of securities that we sell or issue in the future, if any, your interest in us could be further diluted by any adjustments to the number of shares and the applicable exercise price required pursuant to the terms of the agreements under which we previously issued convertible securities.\nThe number of shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of our outstanding convertible notes and Series B convertible preferred stock or exercise of outstanding warrants and options is substantial.\nAs of March 15, 2015, the outstanding convertible notes, including up to $150,000 in outstanding principal of the Tonaquint note, recently extended, were convertible into an aggregate of 7,676,902 shares of our common stock and the outstanding shares of our Series B convertible preferred stock were convertible into an aggregate of 8,524,700 shares of our common stock. In addition, as of that date we had warrants outstanding and issuable those are exercisable for an aggregate of 26,205,632 shares and outstanding options for 6,940,395 shares. Together, the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion or exercise of these securities constitute approximately 50.8% of the total number of shares of common stock then issued and outstanding. Further, under the terms of our convertible notes and Series B convertible preferred stock, as well as certain of our outstanding warrants, the conversion price or exercise price, as the case may be, could be adjusted downward, causing substantial dilution. See \u201c-Adjustments to the conversion price for our convertible notes or our Series B convertible preferred stock, and the exercise price for certain of our warrants, will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders.\u201d\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nIf our common stockholders (including those persons who may become common stockholders upon conversion of our Series B Preferred Stock or convertible notes, or exercise of our warrants) sell substantial amounts of our common stock, or the public market perceives that stockholders might sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. Such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that our management deems appropriate.\nIn addition, our Series B Preferred Stock and certain of our outstanding warrants contain anti-dilution provisions that may, under certain circumstances, reduce the conversion or exercise price or increase the number of shares issuable, or both.\nAdjustments to the conversion price for our convertible notes or our Series B Preferred Stock, and the exercise price for certain of our warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders.\nUnder the terms of our convertible notes, the conversion price fluctuates with the market price of our common stock. Accordingly, if the market price of our common stock decreases, the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes will increase, and may result in the issuance of a significant number of additional shares of our common stock upon conversion.\nUnder the terms of our Series B convertible preferred stock and certain warrants issued with the Series B convertible preferred stock, subject to certain exceptions, the conversion price for the Series B convertible preferred stock and the exercise price for the warrants will be lowered if we issue common stock at a per share price below the then conversion price for the Series B convertible preferred stock or the then exercise price for the warrants, respectively. Reductions in the conversion price for the Series B convertible preferred stock and the exercise price for the warrants may result in the issuance of a significant number of additional shares of our common stock upon conversion or exercise of these securities, which could result in dilution in the value of the shares of our outstanding common stock and the voting power represented thereby.\nDue to the issuance of shares of common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes through March 15, 2015, the conversion price of the Series B convertible preferred stock has been lowered from $0.68 per share to $0.15 per share, such that, as of such date, each share was convertible into 6,676 shares of common stock, and one tranche of the warrants, previously exercisable for 1,858,089 shares of common stock at $1.08 per share, was exercisable for 13,196,019 shares at $0.15 per share.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nStatements in this report, which express \u201cbelief,\u201d \u201canticipation\u201d or \u201cexpectation,\u201d as well as other statements that are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, or Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act.
