In addition, these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and apply to all sections of this Form 10-K.\nThis annual report on Form 10-K, including the documents that we incorporate by reference, contains statements indicating expectations about future performance and other forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We usually use words such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cpredict,\u201d \u201cfuture,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d or \u201ccontinue\u201d or the negative of these terms or similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. These statements appear throughout the Form 10-K and are statements regarding our current intent, belief, or expectation, primarily with respect to our operations and related industry developments. Examples of these statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the following: our expansion plans, our future operating expenses, our future losses, our future expenditures for research and development and the sufficiency of our cash resources. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this annual report. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us and described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this annual report.\nWe cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements.\nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10-Q and 8-K reports to the SEC. Also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our businesses. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.\nWe may be forced into bankruptcy if we cannot reach a settlement with our two major creditors\nEnova owes approximately $4.6 million in aggregate to its two principal creditors, Arens Controls Company, L.L.C. (\u201cArens\u201d) and the Credit Managers Association. Without immediate additional financing or collection of receivables, the Company will need to cease operations. The Company currently has no visibility as to either additional financing or the collection of receivables. Specifically, without a mutually acceptable settlement of the Arens Judgment arising out of Arens Controls Company, L.L.C. v. Enova Systems, Inc., Case No. 13-1102 (7th Circuit) in the amount of $2,014,169, the Company does not currently believe it has any alternative other than to cease operations.\nOn September 24, 2013, Enova and Arens entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (the \"Settlement Agreement\") to resolve the remaining issues between them. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Enova filed on September 27, 2013 a motion to dismiss the pending appeal with prejudice and Arens agreed that, for a period of 120 calendar days from the date of the Settlement Agreement, Arens would not take any action to enforce the Judgment. Thereafter, Arens is entitled, without further notice, to enforce the Judgment against Enova or otherwise exercise all available procedures and remedies for collection of the full amount of the Judgment and Enova has agreed not to contest the validity of the Judgment. However, if Enova had paid to Arens $300,000 at any time during the 120 day period, then within 3 business days after Arens received confirmation of such payment, Arens agreed to file a satisfaction of judgment stating that the Judgment has been satisfied and completely release and forever discharge Enova from any and all claims for damages whatsoever that occurred prior to the date of the Settlement Agreement. In exchange for Arens's release, Enova agreed to completely release and forever discharge Arens from any and all claims for damages whatsoever that occurred prior to the date of the Settlement Agreement. The Company was not able to comply with the due date for such payment by January 22, 2014. Therefore, the judgment against the Company can be enforced without further notice.\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities, engaging in debt financings or through licensing arrangements may cause substantial dilution to existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities as we did in 2011, April 2012, May 2012 and February 2014, our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership may be substantially diluted. Any debt financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations or our ability to enter into other funding arrangements. These restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets, as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, redeem our stock or make investments. In addition, if we raise additional funds through licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our potential products or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nOur history of operating losses and our expectation of continuing losses may hurt our ability to reach profitability or continue operations.\nWe have experienced significant operating losses since our inception. Our net loss was $619,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and our accumulated deficit was $162,870,000 as of December 31, 2014. It is likely that we will continue to incur substantial net operating losses for the foreseeable future, which may adversely affect our ability to continue operations. To achieve profitable operations, we must successfully develop and market our products at higher margins. We may not be able to generate sufficient product revenue to become profitable. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase our profitability on a quarterly or yearly basis.\nWe are dependent on access to capital markets in order to fund continued operations of the Company.\nWe do not currently have adequate internal liquidity to fund the Company\u2019s operations on an ongoing basis. We will need to continue to look for partnering opportunities and other external sources of liquidity, including the public and private financial markets and strategic partners. We may not be able to obtain financing arrangements in amounts or on terms acceptable to us in the future. In the event we are unable to obtain additional financing when needed, and without substantial reductions in development programs and strategic initiatives, we do not expect that our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs for the twelve months following December 31, 2014.\nBecause we depend upon sales to a limited number of customers, our revenues will be reduced if we lose a major customer\nOur revenue is dependent on significant orders from a limited number of customers. We had no revenues in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, our two largest customers comprised 95% of revenues. We believe that revenues from major customers will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues. This customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results. The loss or reduction of business from one or a combination of our significant customers will adversely affect our revenues, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, our success will depend in part upon our ability to obtain orders from new customers, as well as the financial condition and success of our customers and general economic conditions.\nOur future growth depends on consumers\u2019 willingness to accept hybrid and electric vehicles\nOur growth is highly dependent upon the acceptance by consumers of, and we are subject to an elevated risk of any reduced demand for, alternative fuel vehicles in general and electric vehicles in particular. If the market for electric vehicles does not develop as we expect or develops more slowly than we expect, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely affected. The market for alternative fuel vehicles is relatively new, rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly evolving and changing technologies, price competition, additional competitors and changing consumer demands or behaviors. Factors that may influence the acceptance of alternative fuel vehicles include:\n\u2022\nperceptions about alternative fuel vehicles safety (in particular with respect to lithium-ion battery packs), design, performance and cost, especially if adverse events or accidents occur that are linked to the quality or safety of alternative fuel vehicles;\n\u2022\nvolatility in the cost of oil and gasoline;\n\u2022\nconsumer\u2019s perceptions of the dependency of the United States on oil from unstable or hostile countries;\n\u2022\nimprovements in fuel of the internal combustion engine;\n\u2022\nthe environmental consciousness of consumers;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulation\n\u2022\nMacroeconomics\nWe extend credit to our customers, which exposes us to credit risk\nMost of our outstanding accounts receivable are from a limited number of large customers. At December 31, 2014, the two highest outstanding accounts receivable balances totaled approximately $404,000 which represents 100% of our gross accounts receivable. We have fully reserved our accounts receivable at December 31, 2014. If we fail to monitor and manage effectively the resulting credit risk and a material portion of our accounts receivable is not paid in a timely manner or becomes uncollectible, our business would be significantly harmed, and we could incur a significant loss associated with any outstanding accounts receivable.\nOur business is affected by current economic and financial market conditions in the markets we serve\nCurrent global economic and financial markets conditions, including severe disruptions in the credit markets and the significant and potentially prolonged global economic recession, may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are particularly impacted by any global automotive slowdown and its effects on OEM inventory levels, production schedules, support for our products and decreased ability to accurately forecast future product demand.\nThe nature of our industry is dependent on technological advancement and is highly competitive\nThe mobile power market, including electric vehicle and hybrid electric vehicles, continue to be subject to rapid technological changes. Most of the major domestic and foreign automobile manufacturers: (1) have already produced electric and hybrid vehicles, (2) have developed improved electric storage, propulsion and control systems, and/or (3) are now entering or have entered into production, while continuing to improve technology or incorporate newer technology. Various companies are also developing improved electric storage, propulsion and control systems.\nOur industry is affected by political and legislative changes\nIn recent years there has been significant legislation enacted in the United States and abroad to reduce or eliminate automobile pollution, promote or mandate the use of vehicles with no tailpipe emissions (\u201czero emission vehicles\u201d) or reduced tailpipe emissions (\u201clow emission vehicles\u201d). Although states such as California have enacted such legislation, we cannot assure you that there will not be further legislation enacted changing current requirements or that current legislation or state mandates will not be repealed or amended, or that a different form of zero emission or low emission vehicle will not be invented, developed and produced, and achieve greater market acceptance than electric or hybrid electric vehicles.\nWe may be unable to effectively compete with other companies who have significantly greater resources than we have\nMany of our competitors, in the automotive, electronic, and other industries, have substantially greater financial, personnel, and other resources than we do. Because of their greater resources, some of our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sales of their products than we can.\nWe may be exposed to product liability or tort claims if our products fail, which could adversely impact our results of operations\nA malfunction or the inadequate design of our products could result in product liability or other tort claims. Any liability for damages resulting from malfunctions could be substantial and could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, a well-publicized actual or perceived problem could adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of our products.\nWe are highly dependent on a few key personnel and will need to retain and attract such personnel in a labor competitive market\nOur ability to continue in business is dependent on the performance of key management and technical personnel, the loss of whom could severely affect our business. Additionally, in order to successfully implement any future growth, we will be dependent on our ability to generate resources necessary to hire qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or hire necessary personnel. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our key personnel. We believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled personnel in an increasingly competitive market.\nWe are highly dependent on a few vendors for key system components made to our engineering specifications and disruption of vendor supply could adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur product specifications often involve upfront investment in tooling and machinery, which result in our commitment to a limited number of high quality vendors that can meet our manufacturing standards. Any disruption to our supply of key components from the suppliers would have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThere are minimal barriers to entry in our market\nWe own only certain limited proprietary technology and therefore have created little or no barrier to entry for competitors other than the time and significant expense required to assemble and develop similar production and design capabilities.\nOur competitors may enter into exclusive arrangements with our current or potential suppliers, thereby giving them a competitive edge which we may not be able to overcome, and which may exclude us from similar relationships.", "PERMNO": 91412, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "ENVS"}
