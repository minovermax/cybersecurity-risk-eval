RISK FACTORS.\nThe following are certain risk factors that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOUR INDEBTEDNESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CASH FLOW.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had $2,258.9 million of total consolidated indebtedness. We incurred much of this indebtedness as a result of financing acquisitions and refinancing our previously outstanding debt. In addition, at December 31, 2019, after taking into account outstanding letters of credit of $15.4 million, we had up to $1.17 billion and Cdn $15.0 million of revolving loans that we may borrow under our Credit Agreement. We also have available to us under our Credit Agreement an uncommitted multicurrency incremental loan facility in an amount of up to an additional $1.25 billion (which amount may be increased as provided under our Credit Agreement), and we may incur additional indebtedness as permitted by our Credit Agreement and our other instruments governing our indebtedness. In conjunction with the Offer to purchase the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business, we obtained the Committed Financing, and we expect to fund the purchase price for the proposed acquisition of the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business from a combination of borrowings under our Credit Agreement, including the Committed Financing, and cash on hand. Additionally, on February 26, 2020 we issued (i) an additional $200 million aggregate principal amount of the 4\u215b% Notes and (ii) \u20ac500 million aggregate principal amount of the 2\u00bc% Notes due 2028, or the 2\u00bc% Notes, in a private placement in reliance on Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We used the net proceeds from such issuances to prepay most of our outstanding U.S. A term loans under our Credit Agreement.\nA significant portion of our cash flow must be used to service our indebtedness and is therefore not available to be used in our business. In 2019, we repaid $41.1 million in mandatory principal and paid $108.8 million in interest on our indebtedness. Our ability to generate cash flow is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that may be beyond our control. In addition, a significant portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates, and therefore a substantial increase in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations. Based on the average outstanding amount of our variable rate indebtedness in 2019, a one percentage point change in the interest rates for our variable rate indebtedness would have impacted our 2019 interest expense by an aggregate amount of approximately $13.1 million, after taking into account the average outstanding notional amount of our interest rate swap agreements during 2019.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, acquisitions and capital expenditures, and for other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities; and\n\u2022\nlimit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds.\nDESPITE OUR CURRENT LEVELS OF INDEBTEDNESS, WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD INCREASE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR LEVERAGE.\nWe are continually evaluating and pursuing acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market and may incur additional indebtedness, including indebtedness under our Credit Agreement, to finance any such acquisitions and to fund any resulting increased operating needs, including for the pending proposed acquisition of the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business. In 2017, for example, we funded the purchase price for our acquisition of SDS through term loan and revolving loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement in the aggregate amount of $1,023.8 million. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks we now face could increase. We will have to effect any new financing in compliance with the agreements governing our then existing indebtedness. The indentures governing the 4\u00be% Notes and the 3\u00bc% Notes, the 4\u215b% Notes and the 2\u00bc% Notes do not prohibit us from incurring additional indebtedness.\nTHE TERMS OF OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS RESTRICT THE MANNER IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS AND MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT ELEMENTS OF OUR GROWTH STRATEGY.\nOur Credit Agreement contains numerous covenants, including financial and operating covenants, some of which are quite restrictive. These covenants affect, and in many respects limit, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell assets;\n\u2022\nmake certain advances, investments and loans;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nengage in any business other than the packaging business and certain related businesses.\nThe indentures governing the 4\u00be% Notes and the 3\u00bc% Notes, the 4\u215b% Notes and the 2\u00bc% Notes contain certain covenants that also restrict our ability to create liens, issue guarantees, engage in sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge or sell assets. These covenants could restrict us in the pursuit of our growth strategy.\nWE FACE COMPETITION FROM MANY COMPANIES AND WE MAY LOSE SALES OR EXPERIENCE LOWER MARGINS ON SALES AS A RESULT OF SUCH COMPETITION.\nThe manufacture and sale of metal and plastic containers and closures is highly competitive. We compete with other manufacturers of metal and plastic containers and closures and manufacturers of alternative packaging products, as well as packaged goods companies who manufacture containers and closures for their own use and for sale to others. We compete primarily on the basis of price, quality and service. To the extent that any of our competitors is able to offer better prices, quality and/or services, we could lose customers and our sales and margins may decline.\nIn 2019, approximately 90 percent of our metal container sales and a majority of our closures and plastic container sales were pursuant to multi-year supply arrangements. Although no assurances can be given, we have been successful historically in continuing these multi-year customer supply arrangements. Additionally, in general, many of these arrangements provide that during the term the customer may receive competitive proposals for all or up to a portion of the products we furnish to the customer. We have the right to retain the business subject to the terms and conditions of the competitive proposal. If we match a competitive proposal, it may result in reduced sales prices for the products that are the subject of the proposal. If we choose not to match a competitive proposal, we may lose the sales that were the subject of the proposal.\nThe loss of any major customer, a significant reduction in the purchasing levels of any major customer or a significant adverse change in the terms of our supply agreement with any major customer could adversely affect our results of operations.\nDEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO FOOD AND BEVERAGES AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES.\nWe manufacture and sell metal and plastic rigid packaging for consumer goods products. Many of our products are used to package food and beverages, and therefore they come into direct contact with these products. Accordingly, such products must comply with various laws and regulations for food and beverages applicable to our customers. Changes in such laws and regulations could negatively impact our customers\u2019 demand for our products as they comply with such changes and/or require us to make changes to our products. Such changes to our products could include modifications relating to the inclusion of bisphenol A in the coatings and compounds that we use, possibly resulting in the incurrence by us of additional costs. Additionally, because our products are used to package consumer goods, we are subject to a variety of risks that could influence consumer behavior and negatively impact demand for our products, including changes in consumer preferences driven by various health-related and environmental concerns and perceptions.\nOUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF RAW MATERIALS OR MAINTAIN OUR ABILITY TO PASS RAW MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES THROUGH TO OUR CUSTOMERS.\nWe purchase steel, aluminum, plastic resins and other raw materials from various suppliers. Sufficient quantities of these raw materials may not be available in the future, whether due to reductions in capacity because of, among other things, significant consolidation of suppliers, increased demand in excess of available supply, unforeseen events such as significant hurricanes, government imposed quotas or other reasons. In addition, such materials are subject to price fluctuations due to a number of factors, including increases in demand for the same raw materials, the availability of other substitute materials, tariffs and general economic conditions that are beyond our control.\nOver the last few years, there has been significant consolidation of suppliers of steel worldwide. In addition, tariffs, quotas and court cases have negatively impacted the ability and desire of steel suppliers to competitively supply steel outside of their countries. More recently, the United States began imposing new tariffs on steel supply into the United States from certain foreign countries starting in June 2018, which has increased the cost of steel imported into the United States as well as ultimately steel manufactured in the United States. Additionally, exemptions from tariffs granted by the United States have been inconsistent and unpredictable. In Europe, recently enacted quotas on foreign steel supply has negatively impacted the ability of foreign steel suppliers to supply steel into Europe. Additional tariffs and/or quotas or other limitations on steel supply could further negatively impact the ability and desire of steel suppliers to competitively supply steel outside of their countries. Our metal container and metal closures supply agreements with our customers provide for the pass through of changes in our metal costs. For our customers without long-term agreements, we also generally increase prices to pass through increases in our metal costs. However, the impact of tariffs and quotas creates volatility in the applicable markets and therefore creates challenges for us and our customers in passing through costs related to such tariffs and quotas.\nOur resin requirements are primarily acquired through multi-year arrangements for specific quantities of resins with several major suppliers of resins. The prices that we pay for resins are not fixed and are subject to market pricing, which has fluctuated significantly in the past few years. Our plastic container, plastic closures and dispensing systems supply agreements with our customers generally provide for the pass through of changes in resin costs, subject in many cases to a lag in the timing of such pass through. For customers without long-term agreements, we also generally pass through changes in resin costs.\nAlthough no assurances can be given, we expect to be able to purchase sufficient quantities of raw materials to timely meet all of our customers\u2019 requirements in 2020. Additionally, although no assurances can be given, we generally have been able to pass raw material cost increases through to our customers. The loss of our ability to pass those cost increases through to our customers or the inability of our suppliers to meet our raw material requirements, however, could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nGLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, DISRUPTIONS IN CREDIT MARKETS AND IN MARKETS GENERALLY AND THE INSTABILITY OF THE EURO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nIn the past, the global financial markets have experienced substantial disruption, including, among other things, volatility in securities prices, diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. Additionally, the global economy experienced a recession, and economic uncertainty has generally continued in European markets and in China. If such economic conditions, disruption of global financial markets and tightening of credit in the financial markets were to occur again, then, among other risks we face, our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to obtain additional financing in the future, including on terms satisfactory to us, could be adversely affected.\nEconomic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets could also harm the liquidity or financial position of our customers or suppliers, which could in turn cause such parties to fail to meet their contractual or other obligations to us or reduce our customers\u2019 purchases from us, any of which could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, under such circumstances, the creditworthiness of the counterparties to our interest rate and commodity pricing transactions could deteriorate, thereby increasing the risk that such counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations to us.\nGlobal markets are also susceptible to disruptions and resulting negative impacts from other occurrences and events, such as pandemics and contagious diseases like the recent outbreak of coronavirus, which could negatively affect global markets and the global economy. Such occurrences and events could cause or require us, our suppliers or our customers to temporarily suspend operations in affected regions, otherwise disrupt or affect our,\nour suppliers\u2019 or our customers\u2019 operations or businesses, disrupt supply chains, commerce and travel, or cause an economic downturn or otherwise negatively impact consumer behavior and demand. Any such occurrences, events or disruptions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThere has been concern regarding the overall stability of the Euro and the future of the Euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Eurozone countries. Potential developments and market perceptions related to the Euro could adversely affect the value of our Euro-denominated assets, reduce the amount of our translated amounts of U.S. dollar revenue and income, negatively impact our indebtedness in any such Eurozone country (including our ability to refinance such indebtedness) and otherwise negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, in June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit) and in January of 2020 the United Kingdom left the European Union. The implementation and effects of Brexit have been marked by political unpredictability and lack of clarity around the future economic relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union. Although our revenue and income related to the United Kingdom is less than one percent of our overall revenue and income, Brexit could potentially disrupt and create uncertainty surrounding our business related to the United Kingdom, including our relationships with existing and future customers, suppliers and employees both during any applicable transition period and after. We cannot predict the short-term or long-term economic, financial, trade and legal implications that the ultimate withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union would have and how such withdrawal would affect our business globally and in the region. In addition, Brexit may lead other European Union member countries to consider referendums regarding their European Union membership.\nA SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN NORMAL CROP YIELD MAY REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR METAL CONTAINERS AND CLOSURES FOR FOOD PRODUCTS.\nOur metal container business\u2019 sales and income from operations are dependent, in part, upon the vegetable and fruit harvests in the midwest and western regions of the United States and, to a lesser extent, in a variety of national growing regions in Europe. Our closures business is also dependent, in part, upon the vegetable and fruit harvests. The size and quality of these harvests varies from year to year, depending in large part upon the weather conditions in applicable regions, and our results of operations could be impacted accordingly. Our sales, income from operations and net income could be materially adversely affected in a year in which crop yields are substantially lower than normal. For example, the results of our metal container business in 2019 were negatively impacted by poor harvests in Europe.\nTHE SEASONALITY OF THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PACKING INDUSTRY CAUSES US TO INCUR SHORT-TERM DEBT.\nWe sell metal containers and closures used to package fruits and vegetables, which is a seasonal process. As a result, we have historically generated a disproportionate amount of our annual income from operations in our third quarter. Additionally, as is common in the packaging industry, we must access working capital to build inventory ahead of the fruit and vegetable packing process. We also provide extended payment terms to some of our customers due to the seasonality of the fruit and vegetable packing process and, accordingly, carry accounts receivable for some customers beyond the end of the packing season. Due to our seasonal requirements, we may incur short-term indebtedness to finance our working capital requirements.\nTHE COST OF PRODUCING OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY VARIOUS FACTORS.\nThe cost of producing our products is affected by many factors, some of which can be volatile and some of which may be challenging. For example, the cost of producing our products is sensitive to our energy costs, such as natural gas and electricity. We have, from time to time, entered into contracts to hedge a portion of our natural gas costs. Energy prices, in particular oil and natural gas prices, have been volatile in recent years, with a corresponding effect on our production costs.\nMany countries, including most recently the United States, have imposed tariffs on imported products from certain other countries, including products and components supplied cross border within a company. Although we engage in limited cross border supply within our businesses, tariffs or quotas imposed on any cross border supplies within our businesses would increase the cost of our products and could adversely impact our results of operations. Additionally, local suppliers tend to increase prices for their products due to the protection offered by tariffs. Any such increases would increase the cost of our products and could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PURSUE OUR GROWTH STRATEGY BY ACQUISITION.\nHistorically, we have grown predominantly through acquisitions. Our future growth will depend in large part on additional acquisitions of consumer goods packaging businesses. We may not be able to locate or acquire other suitable acquisition candidates consistent with our strategy, and we may not be able to fund future acquisitions because of limitations under our indebtedness or otherwise, including due to the limited availability of funds if the financial markets are impaired.\nFUTURE ACQUISITIONS MAY CREATE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND DIVERT OUR MANAGEMENT\u2019S ATTENTION.\nIn pursuing our strategy of growth through acquisitions, including for the pending proposed acquisition of Alb\u00e9a's dispensing business we will face risks commonly encountered with an acquisition strategy. These risks include:\n\u2022\nfailing to identify material problems and liabilities in our due diligence review of acquisition targets;\n\u2022\nfailing to obtain sufficient indemnification rights to fully offset possible liabilities associated with acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nfailing to assimilate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in identifying or retaining employees for the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ndisrupting our ongoing business;\n\u2022\ndiluting our limited management resources;\n\u2022\noperating in new geographic regions; and\n\u2022\nimpairing relationships with employees and customers of the acquired business as a result of changes in ownership and management.\nThrough our experience integrating our acquisitions, we have learned that, depending upon the size of the acquisition, it can take us up to two to three years to completely integrate an acquired business into our operations and systems and realize the full benefit of the integration. During the early part of this integration period, the operating results of an acquired business may decrease from results attained prior to the acquisition due to costs, delays or other challenges that arise when integrating the acquired business. In addition, we may not be able to achieve potential synergies or maintain the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that each business had achieved or might achieve separately. Moreover, indebtedness incurred to fund acquisitions could adversely affect our liquidity and financial stability.\nTHE PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF THE ALB\u00c9A DISPENSING BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO THE SELLERS' EXERCISE OF THE OPTION CONTAINED IN THE OFFER AND CERTAIN CONDITIONS, INCLUDING ANTITRUST CLEARANCES, AS WELL AS OTHER UNCERTAINTIES, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES AS TO WHETHER AND WHEN IT MAY BE COMPLETED. A DELAY OR FAILURE TO CONSUMMATE THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nOn January 27, 2020, we made the Offer to Alb\u00e9a, on behalf of itself and the Sellers, to purchase the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business. We and the Sellers have not yet entered into a definitive purchase agreement for the proposed acquisition of the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business, pending certain consultation and notification processes with applicable works\u2019 councils and trade unions and the Sellers\u2019 exercise of the option contained in the Offer. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the Sellers will exercise the option contained in the Offer and the parties will enter into the SPA.\nIn addition, the consummation of the proposed acquisition of the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the receipt of applicable antitrust clearances, which clearances, if not obtained by a certain date, would require us to pay a break fee of $25 million to the Sellers. We cannot predict with certainty whether or when any of the required conditions for the proposed acquisition of the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business will be satisfied, whether the satisfaction of any such conditions will result in a materially adverse impact on us or to the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business or if this proposed acquisition will be consummated at all. If this proposed acquisition is not completed, if there is a significant delay in completing it or if the satisfaction of any such conditions results in a materially adverse impact, such failure, delay or impact could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition.\nWE MAY BE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE, OR MAY BE DELAYED IN ACHIEVING, ADEQUATE RETURNS FROM OUR EFFORTS TO OPTIMIZE OUR OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nWe continually strive to improve our operating performance and further enhance our franchise positions in our businesses through the investment of capital for productivity improvements, manufacturing efficiencies, manufacturing cost reductions and the rationalization of our manufacturing facilities footprints. For example, in 2019 we initiated a multi-year footprint optimization plan in our metal container business in the U.S. to reduce capacity and continue to drive cost reductions, which includes the likely shutdown of six manufacturing facilities over a three year period. Our operations include complex manufacturing systems as well as intricate scheduling and numerous geographic and logistical complexities associated with our facilities and our customers\u2019 facilities. Accordingly, our efforts to achieve productivity improvements, manufacturing efficiencies and manufacturing cost reductions and to rationalize our manufacturing facilities footprints are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could impact our ability to achieve adequate returns from our efforts as planned. These risks and uncertainties include, among others, completing any such efforts on time and as planned and retaining customers impacted thereby.\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO RETAIN KEY MANAGEMENT, WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.\nWe believe that our future success depends, in large part, on our experienced management team. Losing the services of key members of our current management team could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives.\nPROLONGED WORK STOPPAGES AT OUR FACILITIES WITH UNIONIZED LABOR COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we employed approximately 9,900 hourly employees on a full-time basis. Approximately 36 percent of our hourly plant employees in the United States and Canada as of that date were represented by a variety of unions, and most of our hourly employees in Europe, Asia, South America and Central America were represented by a variety of unions or other labor organizations. Our labor contracts expire at various times between 2020 and 2024. We cannot assure you that, upon expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements, new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new agreements will be on terms no less favorable to us than current agreements. Disputes with the unions representing our employees could result in strikes or other labor protests that could disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management from operating our business. A strike or work stoppage could make it difficult for us to find a sufficient number of people with the necessary skills to replace those employees. Prolonged work stoppages at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO COSTS AND LIABILITIES RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND RISKS RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\nWe continually review our compliance with environmental and other laws, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act and other laws regulating noise exposure levels and other safety and health concerns in the production areas of our plants in the United States and environmental protection, health and safety laws and regulations abroad. We may incur liabilities for noncompliance, or substantial expenditures to achieve compliance, with environmental and other laws or changes thereto in the future or as a result of the application of additional laws and regulations to our business, including those limiting greenhouse gas emissions, those requiring compliance with the European Commission\u2019s registration, evaluation and authorization of chemicals (REACH) procedures, and those imposing changes that would have the effect of increasing the cost of producing or would otherwise adversely affect the demand for plastic products. In addition, stricter regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations, may impose new liabilities on us, and we may become obligated in the future to incur costs associated with the investigation and/or remediation of contamination at our facilities or other locations. Additionally, many of our products come into contact with the food and beverages that they package, and therefore we may be subject to risks and liabilities related to health and safety matters in connection with our products. Changes in or additional health and safety laws and regulations in connection with our products may also impose new requirements and costs on us. Such requirements, liabilities and costs could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition or competitive position.\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings, contract disputes and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Additionally, a competition authority in Germany commenced an antitrust investigation in 2015 involving the industry association for metal packaging in Germany and its members, including our metal container and closures subsidiaries in Germany. At the end of April 2018, the European Commission commenced an antitrust\ninvestigation involving the metal packaging industry in Europe including our metal container and closures subsidiaries, which should effectively close out the investigation in Germany. Although we are not able to predict the outcome of such proceedings, investigations, disputes and claims, any payments in respect thereof, including pursuant to any settlements, will reduce our available cash flows and could adversely impact our results of operations.\nOUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.\nOur international operations generated approximately $1,071.1 million, or approximately 24 percent, of our consolidated net sales in 2019. As of February 4, 2020, we have a total of 41 manufacturing facilities in a total of 18 countries outside of the United States, including Canada, Mexico and countries located in Europe, Asia and South America, serving customers in approximately 100 countries worldwide. Our business strategy may include continued expansion of international activities, including with the pending proposed acquisition of the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business. Accordingly, the risks associated with operating in foreign countries, including Canada, Mexico and countries located in Europe, Asia and South America, may have a negative impact on our liquidity and net income. For example, the current economic uncertainty in Europe and China and the geopolitical disruptions in Russia and the Middle East and related adverse economic conditions and the current trade uncertainty throughout the world may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks associated with operating in foreign countries include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\npolitical, social and economic instability;\n\u2022\ninconsistent product regulation or policy changes by foreign agencies or governments;\n\u2022\nwar, civil disturbance or acts of terrorism;\n\u2022\ntrade disputes:\n\u2022\ncompliance with and changes in applicable foreign laws;\n\u2022\nloss or non-renewal of treaties or similar agreements with foreign tax authorities;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nhigh social benefits for labor;\n\u2022\nnational and regional labor strikes;\n\u2022\nimposition of limitations on conversions of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or payment of dividends and other payments by non-U.S. subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange rate risks;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in expatriating cash generated or held by non-U.S. subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nuncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, or the interpretation thereof, affecting foreign tax credits or tax deductions relating to our non-U.S. earnings or operations;\n\u2022\nhyperinflation, currency devaluation or defaults in certain foreign countries;\n\u2022\nduties, taxes or government royalties, including the imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by non-U.S. subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ncustoms, import/export and other trade compliance regulations or policies;\n\u2022\nnon-tariff barriers and higher duty rates;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in collecting international accounts receivable and potentially longer payment cycles;\n\u2022\napplication of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws;\n\u2022\nincreased costs in maintaining international manufacturing and marketing efforts; and\n\u2022\ntaking of property by nationalization or expropriation without fair compensation.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTS OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.\nOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. As a result of our international operations, a portion of our consolidated net sales, and some of our costs, assets and liabilities, are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, we must translate local currency financial results into U.S. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Consequently, changes in exchange rates may unpredictably and adversely affect our consolidated operating results. For example, during times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported international revenue and earnings will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer U.S. dollars. Conversely, a weakening U.S. dollar will effectively increase the dollar-equivalent of our expenses denominated in foreign currencies. Although we may use currency exchange rate protection agreements from time to time to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations in some cases, these hedges may not eliminate or reduce the effect of currency fluctuations.\nIF THE INVESTMENTS IN OUR PENSION BENEFIT PLANS DO NOT PERFORM AS EXPECTED, WE MAY HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS TO THESE PLANS, WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE TO COVER OPERATING AND OTHER EXPENSES.\nWe maintain noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans covering a substantial number of our employees, which we fund based on certain actuarial assumptions. The plans\u2019 assets consist primarily of common stocks and fixed income securities. If the investments of the plans do not perform at expected levels, then we may have to contribute additional funds to ensure that the plans will be able to pay out benefits as scheduled. Such an increase in funding would result in a decrease in our available cash flow. In addition, any such investment performance significantly below our expected levels could adversely impact our results of operations. For example, the significant market declines in investment values at the end of 2018 as compared to our assumed rate of return for the plans for the year had a non-cash unfavorable impact of approximately $20 million on our results of operations in 2019.\nWE PARTICIPATE IN MULTIEMPLOYER PENSION PLANS UNDER WHICH, IN THE EVENT OF CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, WE COULD INCUR ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES WHICH MAY BE MATERIAL AND MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.\nIn 2019, we participated in four multiemployer pension plans which provide defined benefits to certain of our union employees. We withdrew from participating in the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan, or the Central States Pension Plan, at the end of 2019, and accordingly we now participate in three multiemployer pension plans. We expect to incur cash expenditures for the withdrawal liability related to such withdrawal from the Central States Pension Plan of approximately $3.1 million annually for the next twenty years, beginning in 2020. Because of the nature of multiemployer pension plans, there are risks associated with participating in such plans that differ from single-employer pension plans. Amounts contributed by an employer to a multiemployer pension plan are not segregated into a separate account and are not restricted to provide benefits only to employees of that contributing employer. In the event that another participating employer to a multiemployer pension plan in which we participate no longer contributes to such plan, the unfunded obligations of such plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers, including us. In such event, our required contributions to such plan could increase, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. In the event that we withdraw from participation in a multiemployer pension plan in which we participate or otherwise cease to make contributions to such a plan or in the event of the termination of such a plan, we potentially could be required under applicable law to make withdrawal liability payments to such plan in respect of the unfunded vested benefits of such plan, which unfunded vested benefits could be significant. Such withdrawal liability payments could be material and could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. As further discussed in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 included elsewhere in this Annual Report, two of the multiemployer pension plans in which we still participate have a funded status of less than 65 percent. For further information with respect to our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Plan, please see Notes 4 and 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nIF WE WERE REQUIRED TO WRITE-DOWN ALL OR PART OF OUR GOODWILL OR TRADE NAMES, OUR NET INCOME AND NET WORTH COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.\nAs a result of our acquisitions, we have $1.1 billion of goodwill and $32.1 million of indefinite-lived trade names recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019. We are required to periodically determine if our goodwill and trade names have become impaired, in which case we would write-down the impaired portion. If we were required to write-down all or part of our goodwill or trade names, our net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected.\nINCREASED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY THREATS AND MORE SOPHISTICATED AND TARGETED COMPUTER CRIME COULD POSE A RISK TO OUR SYSTEMS, NETWORKS, PRODUCTS, SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES.\nIn order to conduct our business, we rely on information technology systems, networks and services, some of which are managed, hosted and provided by third-party service providers. Although we have not experienced any material breaches or material losses related to cyberattacks to date, increased global security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and those of our third-party service providers and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information, including, but not limited to, confidential information relating to our employees, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. A cyberattack or other disruption may also result in a financial loss, including potential fines for failure to safeguard data.\nWe have taken steps and incurred costs to further strengthen the security of our computer systems and continue to assess, maintain and enhance the ongoing effectiveness of our information security systems. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including development and implementation of cybersecurity policies and procedures, employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. The techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and often are not recognizable until launched against a target. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. It is therefore possible that in the future we may suffer a criminal attack where unauthorized parties gain access to personal information in our possession, and we may not be able to identify any such incident in a timely manner.\nIn addition, the interpretation and application of data protection laws, including federal, state and international laws, relating to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, security and transfer of personally identifiable data in the United States (including but not limited to the California Consumer Privacy Act), Europe (including but not limited to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation) and elsewhere, are uncertain and evolving.\nAs a result of potential cyberattack threats and existing and new data protection requirements, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur ongoing operating costs as part of our efforts to protect and safeguard our sensitive data and personal information. These efforts also may divert management and employee attention from other business and growth initiatives. A breach in information privacy could result in legal or reputational risks and could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOUR PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL INFLUENCE OVER US AND THEIR EXERCISE OF THAT INFLUENCE COULD BE ADVERSE TO YOUR INTERESTS.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Messrs. Silver and Horrigan beneficially owned an aggregate of 31,250,552 shares of our common stock, or approximately 28 percent of our outstanding common stock, which excludes certain shares of our common stock owned by affiliates and related family transferees of Messrs. Silver and Horrigan that are not deemed to be beneficially owned by Messrs. Silver or Horrigan. Accordingly, if they act together, they will be able to exercise substantial influence over all matters submitted to the stockholders for a vote, including the election of directors. In addition, we and Messrs. Silver and Horrigan have entered into an amended and restated principal stockholders agreement, or the Stockholders Agreement, that provides for certain director nomination rights. Under the Stockholders Agreement, the Group (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement and generally including Messrs. Silver and Horrigan and their affiliates and related family transferees and estates) has the right to nominate for election all of our directors until the Group holds less than one-half of the number of shares of our common stock held by it in the aggregate on February 14, 1997. At least one of the Group\u2019s nominees must be either Mr. Silver or Mr. Horrigan during the three-year period covering the staggered terms of our three classes of directors. On February 14, 1997, the Group held 57,224,720 shares of our common stock in the aggregate (as adjusted for our two-for-one stock splits in 2005, 2010 and 2017). Additionally, the Group has the right to nominate for election either Mr. Silver or Mr. Horrigan as a member of our Board of Directors when the Group no longer holds at least one-half of the number of shares of our common stock held by it in the aggregate on February 14, 1997 but beneficially owns at least 5 percent of our common stock. The Stockholders Agreement continues until the death or disability of both of Messrs. Silver and Horrigan. The provisions of the Stockholders Agreement could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of Silgan Holdings Inc. and preventing our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock in any proposed acquisition of Silgan Holdings Inc.\nANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS IN OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED BY-LAWS COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF DISCOURAGING, DELAYING OR PREVENTING A MERGER OR ACQUISITION. ANY OF THESE EFFECTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by-laws may have the effect of delaying or preventing transactions involving a change of control of Silgan Holdings Inc., including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a substantial premium for their shares over then current market prices, and may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.\nIn particular, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that:\n\u2022\nthe Board of Directors is authorized to issue one or more classes of preferred stock having such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined by the Board;\n\u2022\nthe Board of Directors is divided into three classes, and each year approximately one-third of the directors are elected for a term of three years;\n\u2022\nthe Board of Directors is fixed at seven members, subject to the ability of the Board of Directors to increase the size of the Board of Directors to up to nine members for a period of time; and\n\u2022\naction taken by the holders of common stock must be taken at a meeting and may not be taken by consent in writing.\nAdditionally, our amended and restated by-laws provide that a special meeting of the stockholders may only be called by our Chairman of the Board on his own initiative or at the request of a majority of the Board of Directors, and may not be called by the holders of common stock.\nUPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGE OF CONTROL EVENTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SATISFY ALL OF OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT AND INDENTURES.\nUnder our Credit Agreement, the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in our Credit Agreement) constitutes an event of default, permitting, among other things, the acceleration of amounts owed thereunder. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event as defined in the indentures governing the 4\u00be% Notes and the 3\u00bc% Notes, the 4\u215b% Notes and the 2\u00bc% Notes, we must make an offer to repurchase the 4\u00be% Notes, the 3\u00bc% Notes, the 4\u215b% Notes and the 2\u00bc% Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest to the date of purchase. We may not have sufficient funds or be able to obtain sufficient financing to meet such obligations under our Credit Agreement and such indentures. In addition, even if we were able to finance such obligations, such financing may be on terms that are unfavorable to us or less favorable to us than the terms of our existing indebtedness.\nIF WE FAIL TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO A REASONABLE ASSURANCE LEVEL, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND MAY BE REQUIRED TO RESTATE PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED FINANCIAL INFORMATION, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS, INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN OUR BUSINESS AND THE TRADING PRICES OF OUR SECURITIES.\nEffective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and to assist in the effective prevention of fraud. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. We also need to adapt our internal control over financial reporting as our business grows and changes. As we grow our business and acquire other businesses, our internal controls could become increasingly complex, requiring more time and resources. As further discussed in Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures,\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report, management concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. There is no assurance that, in the future, material weaknesses will not be identified that would cause management to change its conclusion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties or litigation. In addition, failure to maintain adequate internal controls could result in financial statements that do not accurately reflect our financial condition, and we may be required to restate previously published financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, investor confidence in our business and the trading prices of our securities.", "PERMNO": 84563, "SIC": 3411, "TIC": "SLGN"}
