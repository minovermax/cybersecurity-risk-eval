RISK FACTORS\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by numerous risks. You should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this Form 10-K. Should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be negatively impacted.\nEconomic and Industry Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused and may continue to cause significant disruption in our industry, which has and may continue to materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business has been and may continue to be materially impacted by the effects of the widespread outbreak of COVID-19, which was reported to have surfaced first in December 2019 and declared a global pandemic in March 2020. This pandemic has negatively affected the U.S. and global economies, disrupted global supply chains and financial markets, and led to significant travel and business restrictions, including mandatory closures, orders to \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d and restrictions on how businesses operate.\nDuring 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic materially negatively impacted our business and results of operations. While conditions improved during 2021, the extent and duration of ongoing impacts remain uncertain. The pandemic previously resulted in temporary closures of our retail stores and the stores of our wholesale customers where our products are sold, reduced consumer traffic and consumer spending, temporary layoffs of certain employees in our North America retail stores and distribution centers and incremental operating expenses from adopting preventative health and safety measures in our stores, distribution centers and corporate offices. These negative impacts may continue or resurface depending on the ongoing development of the virus and related responses including resurgences and the impact of variants.\nThe disruption caused by the pandemic has and may continue to disrupt the operations of our business partners, including our customers, suppliers, and vendors, and the financial condition of certain of our partners has been and could again be significantly impacted. For example, in 2020 certain of our wholesale customers delayed purchases of our products or cancelled previously placed orders in response to pandemic-related store closures. More recently, we have experienced disruption amongst our distribution, logistics and sourcing partners, including temporary closures or other restrictions placed on factories in key sourcing countries. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused and may continue to cause global logistical challenges, including shipping container shortages, transportation delays, port congestion and labor shortages. These challenges have and may continue to negatively impact our partners and our business, including by disrupting our inventory flow, requiring us to incur increased freight costs and requiring us to cancel or delay sales to some of our customers. This has and may continue to negatively impact our net revenues, gross margin, net income and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic disruption has also led to significant volatility in the capital markets and adversely impacted our stock price. While we have taken measures to maintain our operations and preserve and enhance our access to liquidity, our cash generated from operations was negatively impacted during certain periods of the pandemic and future cash flows may be further impacted by the ongoing development of the pandemic. If we are unable to effectively manage our spending in response to the pandemic, our profitability may be negatively impacted.\nFurther, many of our employees in our corporate offices are working remotely, and may continue to do so. An extended period of remote work arrangements could introduce operational risk, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed below, any of which could have a material effect on us. Though we continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic closely, the situation is changing rapidly, including a resurgence in many countries, and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.\nOur business depends on consumer purchases of discretionary items, which can be negatively impacted during an economic downturn or periods of inflation. This could materially impact our sales, profitability and financial condition.\nMany of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. Many factors impact discretionary spending, including general economic conditions, unemployment, the availability of consumer credit\nand inflationary pressures and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. Global economic conditions may continue to be uncertain, particularly in light of the impacts of COVID-19, and the potential impacts of increasing inflation in the United States (our largest market) remain unknown, making trends in consumer discretionary spending unpredictable. Historically, consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower or during other periods of economic instability or uncertainty, which may lead to declines in sales and slow our long-term growth expectations. Any near or long-term economic disruptions in markets where we sell our products, particularly in the United States, China or other key markets, may materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition and our prospects for growth. In addition, as pandemic conditions improve and restrictions ease, we are unable to predict whether consumer preferences for discretionary items will shift and the level of consumer spending within our industry will be negatively impacted for a period of time. If this were to occur, our sales and prospects for growth may be negatively impacted.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our net revenues and gross profit.\nThe market for performance apparel, footwear and accessories is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. Many of our competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition. Within our international markets, we also compete with local brands that may have strong brand recognition amongst consumers within particular regions. Due to the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in products similar to ours and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. Many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including greater financial, distribution, marketing, digital and other resources; longer operating histories; better brand recognition among consumers; more experience in global markets; greater ability to invest in technology, the digital consumer experience and innovations around sustainability; and greater economies of scale. In addition, our competitors have long-term relationships with our key retail customers that are potentially more important to those customers because of the significantly larger volume and product mix that our competitors sell to them. As a result, these competitors may be better equipped than we are to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by quickly adapting to changes in customer requirements or consumer preferences, readily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities, discounting excess inventory that has been written down or written off, devoting resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement, partnerships and product endorsement, adopting aggressive pricing policies and engaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other disputes.\nIn addition, while one of our growth strategies has been to increase floor space for our products in retail stores and in certain markets expand our distribution to other retailers, retailers have limited resources and floor space, and we must compete with others to develop relationships with them. Increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in floor space in retail locations, reductions in sales or reductions in the prices of our products, and if retailers have better sell through or earn greater margins from our competitors\u2019 products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. Our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross margin could have a negative effect on our brand image and a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur profitability may decline or our growth may be negatively impacted as a result of increasing pressure on pricing.\nOur industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. These factors may cause us to reduce our prices to retailers and consumers or engage in more promotional activity than we anticipate, which could negatively impact our margins and cause our profitability to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. Ongoing and sustained promotional activities could negatively impact our brand image. On the other hand, if we are unwilling to engage in promotional activity on a scale similar to that of our competitors, for instance, to protect our premium brand positioning, and unable to simultaneously offset declining promotional activity with increased sales at premium price points, our ability to achieve short-term growth targets may be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and the price of our stock.\nFluctuations in the cost of raw materials and commodities we use in our products and costs related to our supply chain could negatively affect our operating results.\nThe fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are made of raw materials including petroleum-based products and cotton. Significant price fluctuations, including due to inflation, or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials can materially adversely affect our cost of goods sold. In addition, certain of our manufacturers are subject to government regulations related to wage rates, and therefore the labor costs to produce our products may fluctuate. The cost of transporting our products for distribution and sale is also subject to fluctuation due in large part to the price of oil. Because most of our products are manufactured abroad, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographical distances and an increase in the price of oil can significantly increase costs. Manufacturing delays, such as those caused by COVID-19 related temporary closures and other restrictions placed on factories in key sourcing countries, or unexpected transportation delays, such as those caused by COVID-19 related global logistics challenges, have caused and may continue to cause us to rely more heavily on airfreight to achieve timely delivery to our customers. In addition, shipping costs have risen significantly throughout the world in 2021. These factors have and may continue to significantly increase our freight costs. Any of these fluctuations may increase our cost of products and have an adverse effect on our profit margins, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial results and ability to grow our business may be negatively impacted by global events beyond our control.\nWe operate retail, distribution and warehousing facilities and offices around the world and substantially all of our manufacturers are located outside of the United States. We are subject to numerous risks and global events beyond our control which could negatively impact consumer spending or the operations of us or our customers or business partners, and therefore our results of operations, including: political or labor unrest; military conflict; terrorism; public health crises, disease epidemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19); natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, which may increase in frequency and severity due to climate change; economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries; the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, minimum wage, quality and safety standards and disease epidemics or other public health concerns, as well as rules and regulations regarding climate change; changes in trade policy or actions of foreign or U.S. governmental authorities impacting trade and foreign investment, particularly during periods of heightened tension between U.S. and foreign governments, including the imposition of new import limitations, duties, tariffs, anti-dumping penalties, trade restrictions or restrictions on the transfer of funds; inflation; and changes in local economic conditions in countries where our stores, customers, manufacturers and suppliers are located.\nThese risks could hamper our ability to sell products, negatively affect the ability of our manufacturers to produce or deliver our products or procure materials and increase our cost of doing business generally, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. In the event that one or more of these factors make it undesirable or impractical for us to conduct business in a particular country, our business could be adversely affected.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nWe derive a substantial portion of our sales from large wholesale customers. If the financial condition of our customers declines, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIn Fiscal 2021, sales through our wholesale channel represented approximately 57% of our net revenues. We extend credit to our wholesale customers based on an assessment of a customer\u2019s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral or getting customer insurance against non-collection. We face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation and around collectibility when dealing with financially ailing customers or customers struggling with economic uncertainty. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our wholesale customers throughout the world had to temporarily close their stores or operate their stores under significant restrictions and experienced reduced consumer traffic and purchasing, which resulted in lower sales and cancellations of orders of our products. Many of our wholesale customers have been able to reopen their stores and have experienced a recovery in consumer traffic and purchasing, though consumer traffic in some areas remains below pre-pandemic levels. Given the ongoing uncertainty and constantly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is uncertain whether our wholesale customers will have to temporarily close their stores or operate them under significant restrictions again, and whether they will again experience significantly reduced consumer traffic and purchasing. If\nour wholesale customers continue to experience significant disruptions, this could result in further reductions or cancellations of orders or late or extended payment terms to us, which could negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, during weak economic conditions, customers may be more cautious with orders or may slow investments necessary to maintain a high quality in-store experience for consumers, which may result in lower sales of our products. Furthermore, a slowing economy in our key markets or a continued decline in consumer purchases of sporting goods generally could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our company.\nFrom time to time, certain of our customers have experienced financial difficulties. To the extent one or more of our customers experience significant financial difficulty, bankruptcy, insolvency or cease operations, this could have a material adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not successfully execute our long-term strategies, which may negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur ability to execute on our long-term strategies depends, in part, on successfully executing on strategic growth initiatives in key areas, such as our international business, footwear and our global direct-to-consumer sales channel. Our growth in these areas depends on our ability to continue to successfully grow our e-commerce and mobile application offerings and digital experiences throughout the world, expand our global network of Brand and Factory House stores and continue to successfully increase our product offerings and market share in footwear. Our ability to invest in these growth initiatives on the timeline and at the scale we expect will be negatively impacted if we again experience significant market disruption due to COVID-19 or other significant events, particularly if our North America business, which represented 67% of our total net revenues in Fiscal 2021, does not grow sufficiently. In addition, as we expand our global network of Brand and Factory House stores, if we are unable to operate our stores profitably, our financial results could be impacted, or we could be required to recognize impairment charges. Our long-term strategy also depends on our ability to successfully drive expansion of our gross margins, manage our cost structure and drive return on our investments. If we cannot effectively execute our long-term growth strategies while managing costs effectively, our business could be negatively impacted and we may not achieve our expected results of operations.\nWe may not fully realize the expected benefits of our restructuring plans or other operating or cost-saving initiatives, which may negatively impact our profitability.\nSince 2017, we have executed three separate restructuring plans designed to more closely align our financial resources against the critical priorities of our business and rebalance our cost base to further improve future profitability and cash flow generation. We have also implemented several changes to our operating model and continue to refine our operating model in response to business and market conditions. We may not achieve the operational improvements and efficiencies that we targeted in our restructuring plans and operating model changes, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Implementing any restructuring plan or operating model change presents significant potential risks including, among others, higher than anticipated implementation costs, management distraction from ongoing business activities, failure to maintain adequate controls and procedures while executing our restructuring plans and operating model changes, damage to our reputation and brand image and workforce attrition beyond planned reductions. If we fail to achieve targeted operating improvements and/or cost reductions, our profitability and results of operations could be negatively impacted, which may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term.\nIf we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences, successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products or engage our consumers, or if consumer preferences shift away from performance products, our sales, net revenues and profitability may be negatively impacted.\nOur success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends and anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that shift rapidly and cannot be predicted with certainty. Accordingly, our new products may not receive consumer acceptance. In addition, long lead times for certain of our products may make it hard for us to respond quickly to changes in consumer demands. Our ability to adequately react to and address consumer preferences depends in part upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products and to optimize available consumer data. Moreover, if consumers are not convinced performance apparel, footwear and accessories are a better choice than, and worth the additional cost over, traditional alternatives, sales of performance products may not grow or decline and growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. In addition, consumers are increasingly focused on the environmental and social practices of brands, including the sustainability of the\nproducts sold. From time to time, we may also introduce limited run or specialized products that may increase our sales in the near term, but that may fail to maintain sustained consumer demand. If we are unable to effectively anticipate and respond to consumer preferences as a result of any of these factors, our brand image could be negatively impacted, and our sales, net revenues and profitability may be negatively impacted.\nConsumer shopping and engagement preferences and shifts in distribution channels continue to evolve and if we fail to adapt accordingly our results of operations or future growth could be negatively impacted.\nConsumer preferences regarding the shopping experience and how to engage with brands continue to rapidly evolve. We sell our products through a variety of channels, including through wholesale customers and distribution partners, as well as our own direct-to-consumer business consisting of our Brand and Factory House stores and e-commerce platforms. If we or our wholesale customers do not provide consumers with an attractive in-store experience, our brand image and results of operations could be negatively impacted. In addition, as part of our growth strategy, we are investing significantly in enhancing our online platform capabilities and implementing systems to evolve towards a more omni-channel approach to service our consumers. We are also investing in capabilities and tools to drive higher digital engagement with our consumers and create new digital experiences. If we do not successfully execute this strategy or continue to provide an engaging, reliable and user-friendly digital commerce platform or digital experiences that attract consumers, our brand image, and results of operations as well as our opportunities for future growth could be negatively impacted.\nA decline in sales to, or the loss of, one or more of our key customers could result in a material loss of net revenues and negatively impact our prospects for growth.\nWe generate a significant portion of our wholesale revenues from sales to our largest customers. We currently do not enter into long-term sales contracts with our key customers, relying instead on our relationships with these customers and on our position in the marketplace. As a result, we face the risk that these key customers may not increase their business with us as we expect, or may significantly decrease their business with us or terminate their relationship with us. The failure to increase or maintain our sales to these customers as much as we anticipate would have a negative impact on our growth prospects and any decrease or loss of these key customers' business could result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income or loss. These risks have materially increased and may persist as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. In addition, our customers continue to experience ongoing industry consolidation, particularly in the sports specialty sector. As this consolidation continues, it increases the risk that if any one customer significantly reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find sufficient alternative customers to continue to grow our net revenues, or our net revenues may decline materially. In addition, we may from time to time exit relationships with certain wholesale customers to further drive our premium brand position or for other reasons. This may negatively impact our net revenues if we are unable to replace those sales with additional sales to our other customers or direct sales to consumers.\nWe must successfully manage the increasingly complex operations of our global business, including continued expansion in certain markets where we have limited brand recognition, or our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nA significant element of our growth strategy depends on our continued expansion outside of North America, and we have limited brand recognition and operating experience in certain regions. We must continue to successfully manage the operational difficulties associated with expanding our business to meet increased consumer demand throughout the world. We have limited experience with regulatory requirements and market practices in certain regions outside of North America, and may face difficulties expanding into and successfully operating in those markets, including differences in regulatory environments, labor and market practices, and difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments and consumers\u2019 tastes and preferences. We must also continually evaluate the need to expand critical functions in our business, including sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, our management information systems and other processes and technology. We may not manage these efforts cost-effectively or these efforts could increase the strain on our existing resources. If we experience difficulties in supporting the growth of our business, we could experience an erosion of our brand image or operational challenges leading to a decrease in net revenues and results from operations.\nOur results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products.\nTo ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers before firm orders are placed by our customers. In addition, a significant portion of our net revenues may be generated by at-once orders for immediate delivery to customers, particularly during the last two quarters of the calendar year, which historically has been our peak season. If we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers. Excess inventory may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs or sales at discounted prices or in less preferred distribution channels, negatively impacting gross margin. On the other hand, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, resulting in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, lost sales, as well as damage to our reputation and retailer and distributor relationships.\nFactors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include: changing consumer demand for our products; product introductions by competitors; unanticipated changes in general market or economic conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders or at-once orders placed by retailers; the impact on consumer demand due to unseasonable weather conditions, which may become more frequent or severe as a result of climate change; and terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, political or labor instability or unrest or public health concerns and disease epidemics, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely impact our profitability or cause us not to achieve our expected financial results. These risks have materially increased and may persist with the market disruption caused by COVID-19.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide raw materials for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over these suppliers and manufacturers and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity.\nMany of the materials used in our products are technically advanced products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from a very limited number of sources. Substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers, and, in Fiscal 2021, ten manufacturers produced approximately 65% of our apparel and accessories products, and six produced substantially all of our footwear products. We have no long-term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials and production capacity.\nA number of factors may require us to seek alternative or additional suppliers, which we may not be able to do in a timely or cost-effective manner. We may experience a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we may be unable to locate alternative materials suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. Moreover, our suppliers may not be able to fill our orders in a timely manner depending on market conditions or increased demand for product. For example, in Fiscal 2021 certain of our manufacturers experienced significant financial and operational disruption due to COVID-19, including in key sourcing countries. We have historically provided supply chain finance support to certain of our supply chain partners. In the past, the financial markets supporting supply chain finance programs experienced disruption that resulted in a temporary disruption to our program and challenged the cash flow and liquidity of our partners. While we worked with our partners through the disruption and have re-established a supply chain finance program, there can be no guarantee that such disruption will not occur again. Additionally, if one or more of our suppliers were to experience significant financial difficulty, bankruptcy, insolvency or cease operations, or failed to comply with applicable labor or other laws, we may be required to seek alternative suppliers.\nIn addition, if we lose or need to replace an existing manufacturer or supplier as a result of adverse economic conditions or other reasons, additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or suppliers or manufacturers may not be able to allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. Even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers on our methods, products and quality control standards. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower net revenues and net income (or higher net loss) both in the short and long term.\nWe have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards. If we are unable to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of net revenues resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. In addition, because we do not control our manufacturers, products that fail to meet our standards or other unauthorized products could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge, which could harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace.\nLabor or other disruptions at ports or our suppliers or manufacturers may adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely and cost effective manner. As a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide and on a consistent basis from our suppliers and manufacturers. Labor disputes and disruptions at various ports or at our suppliers or manufacturers could create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, decreased operations, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing or manufacturing seasons. For example, COVID-19 has resulted in delays and disruptions at ports due to workforce decreases, shipping backlogs and capacity constraints, container shortages and other disruptions. This has resulted, and may continue to result, in slower than planned deliveries of inventory and delayed sales to customers. If we experience significant delays or disruption in receiving and distributing our products, this could have an adverse effect on our business, potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages, increased expense (including air freight) to deliver our products and reduced net revenues and net income or higher net loss.\nIf we fail to successfully manage or realize expected results from significant transactions or investments, or if we are required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets, it may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nFrom time to time, we may engage in acquisition opportunities we believe are complementary to our business and brand. Integrating acquired businesses can require significant efforts and resources, which could divert management attention from more profitable business operations. From time to time we have also disposed of certain assets where we did not think our activities aligned to our operating model. If we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses or effectively manage dispositions, we may not realize the financial benefits or other synergies we anticipated. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions, we may record goodwill or other intangible assets. We have recognized goodwill impairment charges in the past, and additional goodwill impairment charges could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, from time to time, we may invest in business infrastructure, new businesses and expansion of existing businesses, such as the expansion of our network of Brand and Factory House stores and our distribution facilities, implementing our global operating and financial reporting information technology system, supporting our digital strategy (including our e-commerce platform), or supporting our corporate infrastructure (including the development of our new global headquarters in Port Covington in Baltimore). These investments require substantial cash investments and management attention, and infrastructure investments may also divert funds from other potential business opportunities. We believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. The failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or synergies we expect could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe value of our brand and sales of our products could be diminished if we are associated with negative publicity.\nOur business could be adversely impacted if negative publicity regarding our brand, our company or our business partners diminishes the appeal of our brand to consumers. For example, while we require our suppliers, manufacturers and licensees of our products to operate their businesses in compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as the social and other standards and policies we impose on them, including our code of conduct, we do not control the conduct of these third parties. A violation, or alleged violation of our policies, labor laws or other laws could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing or damage our brand image. Negative publicity regarding production methods, alleged practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturers or licensees. The risk that our business partners may not act in accordance with our expectations may be exacerbated in markets where our direct sales, supply chain or logistics operations are not as widespread. In addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a variety of athletes, teams and leagues, and many athletes and teams use our products. Negative publicity regarding these partners could negatively impact our brand image and result in diminished loyalty to our brand, regardless of whether such claims are accurate. Furthermore, social media can potentially accelerate and increase the scope of negative publicity. This could diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation or have a negative effect on our sales and results of operations.\nIf we fail to meet the expectations of our stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices, including those relating to sustainability and diversity, equity and inclusion, it may have an adverse effect on our brand, sales of our products and our results of operations.\nCertain customers, consumers, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on the environment, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) practices of companies, including those related to sustainability and diversity, equity and inclusion. If our ESG practices do not meet such stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our brand and reputation could be negatively impacted. Any sustainability report or other information that we publish or make may describe our practices, targets and commitments on a variety of ESG matters, including relating to our actions to address climate change, environmental targets and compliance, social and labor policies and practices, human capital management matters (including those relating to diversity, equity and inclusion) and the materials and manufacturing of our products. It is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with such disclosures, our ESG practices or the speed of their adoption. Our failure, or perceived failure, to meet stakeholder expectations or standards, or our targets or commitments, could harm our reputation, negatively impact our employee retention or have a negative effect on our sales and results of operations. We may also incur additional costs or require additional resources to monitor such stakeholder expectations and standards and to meet our targets and commitments.\nThe costs and return on our investments for our sports marketing sponsorships may become more challenging and this could impact the value of our brand image.\nA key element of our marketing strategy has been to create a link in the consumer market between our products and professional and collegiate athletes. We have developed licensing and sponsorship agreements with a variety of sports teams and athletes at the collegiate and professional level to be their official supplier of performance apparel and footwear. We have also developed licensing agreements to be an official supplier of footwear and/or performance apparel to a variety of professional sports leagues and clubs. However, as competition in the performance apparel and footwear industry has increased, the costs associated with athlete sponsorships and official supplier licensing agreements, including the costs of obtaining and retaining these sponsorships and agreements, have varied and at times increased greatly. If we are unable to maintain our current association with professional and collegiate athletes, teams and leagues, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. In addition, because travel and business restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic have caused and may continue to cause professional and collegiate athletics and other sporting events to be cancelled or delayed, we may not realize the expected benefits of these relationships. As a result, our brand image, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on a limited number of distribution facilities for our product distribution. Our distribution facilities utilize computer controlled and automated equipment, which means the operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses or malware, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. In addition, because many of our products are distributed from a limited number of locations, our operations could also be interrupted by severe weather conditions, floods, fires or other natural disasters in these locations, as well as labor or other operational difficulties or interruptions, including public health crises or disease epidemics. For example, the current COVID-19 pandemic may impede our ability to operate our distribution facilities at full capacity and may similarly impact our third-party logistics providers. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities or from all types of events causing such disruptions. Significant disruptions could lead to loss of customers or an erosion of our brand image. In addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties. This includes the shipping of product to and from our distribution facilities, as well as partnering with third-party distribution facilities in certain regions where we do not maintain our own facilities. From time to time, certain of our partners have experienced and may continue to experience disruptions to their operations, including cyber-related disruptions and disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. If we or our partners encounter such problems, our results of operations, as well as our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.\nWe rely on our own and our vendors' information technology throughout our business operations, including to design, forecast and order product, manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, manage sales and distribution, operate our e-commerce website and mobile applications, process transactions, manage retail operations and other key business activities. We also communicate electronically throughout the world with our employees and with third parties, such as customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. Our operations are dependent on the reliable performance of these systems and technologies and their underlying technical infrastructure, which incorporate complex software. Any of these information systems could fail or experience a service interruption for a number of reasons, including computer viruses, ransomware or other malware, programming errors, hacking or other unlawful activities, disasters or a failure to properly maintain system redundancy or protect, repair, maintain or upgrade the systems. For example, in 2021, a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache log4j was identified as affecting large amounts of systems worldwide, including ours. We have not experienced any material operational disruptions related to this event.\nFrom time to time we have experienced, and may continue to experience, operational disruption due to attacks on our systems and those of our vendors. Although we maintain certain business continuity plans, there can be no assurance that our business continuity plans, or those of our vendors, will anticipate all material risks that may arise or will effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner or adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in key information technology. The failure of these systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, lost sales, the exposure of sensitive business of personal information and damage to the reputation of our brand. Depending on the system and scope of disruption, in some instances a service interruption or shutdown could have a material adverse impact on our operating activities or results of operations. Remediation and repair of any failure, problem or breach of our key systems or known potential vulnerabilities could require significant capital investments, as well as divert resources and management attention from key projects or initiatives.\nWe also heavily rely on information systems to process financial and accounting information for financial reporting purposes. If we experience any significant disruption to our financial information systems that we are unable to mitigate, our ability to timely report our financial results could be impacted, which could negatively impact our stock price.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, and our continued ability to attract and retain highly talented new team members.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management, particularly Kevin A. Plank, our founder, Executive Chairman and Brand Chief, Patrik Frisk, our Chief Executive Officer and President, other top executives and key employees who have substantial experience and expertise in our business, including product creation, innovation, sales, marketing, supply chain, informational technology, operational and other support personnel. The loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals and could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs.\nIn addition, to profitably grow our business and manage our operations, we will need to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly talented management and other employees with a range of skills, backgrounds and experiences. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and in Fiscal 2021, we experienced the effects of increased employee turnover that impacted global labor markets in many of our key operating jurisdictions. Additionally, adoption of new work models and requirements about when or how often employees work on-site or remotely may present new challenges. As certain jobs and employers increasingly operate remotely, traditional geographic competition for talent may change in ways that cannot be fully predicted at this time, If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate management and other employees with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business and achieve our long-term objectives. In addition, we have invested significant time and resources in building, maintaining and evolving our company culture and our values, which we believe to be critical to our future success. Failure to maintain and continue to evolve our culture could negatively affect our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented management and employees and to achieve our long-term objectives.\nFinancial Risks\nOur credit agreement contains financial covenants, and both our credit agreement and debt securities contain other restrictions on our actions, which could limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have, from time to time, financed our liquidity needs in part from borrowings made under our credit facility and the issuance of debt securities. Our Senior Notes limit our ability to, subject to certain significant exceptions, incur secured debt and engage in sale leaseback transactions. Our amended credit agreement contains negative covenants that, subject to significant exceptions limit our ability, among other things to incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, sell or dispose of assets, pledge assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. In addition, we must maintain a certain leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as defined in the amended credit agreement. Our ability to continue to borrow amounts under our amended credit agreement is limited by continued compliance with these financial covenants, and in the past we have amended our credit agreement to provide certain relief from and revisions to our financial covenants for specified periods to provide us with sufficient access to liquidity during those periods. Failure to comply with these operating or financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations or general economic conditions. These covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that would otherwise be in our best interests. Failure to comply with any of the covenants under the amended credit agreement or our Senior Notes could result in a default, which could negatively impact our access to liquidity.\nIn addition, the amended credit agreement includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under certain other debt obligations (including our debt securities) will be considered an event of default under the amended credit agreement. If an event of default occurs, the commitments of the lenders under the amended credit agreement may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated. Our debt securities include a cross acceleration provision which provides that the acceleration of certain other debt obligations (including our credit agreement) will be considered an event of default under our debt securities and, subject to certain time and notice periods, give bondholders the right to accelerate our debt securities.\nWe may need to raise additional capital to manage and grow our business, and we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nManaging and growing our business will require significant cash outlays and capital expenditures and commitments. We have utilized cash on hand and cash generated from operations, accessed our credit facility and issued debt securities as sources of liquidity. For example, during the first and second quarters of Fiscal 2020, our cash generated from operations was negatively impacted due to widespread temporary store closures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.7 billion. However, if in future periods our cash on hand, cash generated from operations and availability under our credit agreement are not sufficient to meet our cash requirements, we will need to seek additional capital, potentially through debt or equity financing, to fund our operations and future growth, and we may be unable to obtain debt and/or equity financing on favorable terms or at all. Our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of liquidity, and the borrowing costs associated with such financing, are dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and outlook. Our credit ratings have been downgraded in the past, and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our current ratings, which could increase our cost of borrowing in the future. In addition, equity financing may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the current price per share of our common stock. The holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to those of existing holders of common stock. If new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would harm our ability to grow our business.\nOur operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income from operations, which could adversely affect the price of our publicly traded common stock.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income or loss from operations. The majority of our net revenues are historically generated during the last two quarters of the calendar year. Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including the timing of our customer orders, our ability to timely delivery, the timing of marketing expenses and changes in our product mix. As a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we\nbelieve that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. Any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. This could cause the price of our publicly traded stock to fluctuate significantly.\nOur results of operations are affected by the performance of our equity investments, over which we do not exercise control.\nWe maintain certain minority investments, and may in the future invest in additional minority investments, which we account for under the equity method, and are required to recognize our allocable share of its net income or loss in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our results of operations are affected by the performance of these businesses, over which we do not exercise control, and our net income or loss may be negatively impacted by losses realized by these investments. For example, we have previously recognized losses related to our Japanese licensee\u2019s business. We are also required to regularly review our investments for impairment, and an impairment charge may result from the occurrence of adverse events or management decisions that impact the fair value or estimated future cash flows to be generated from our investments. In addition, to the extent our Japanese licensee continues to experience challenges in the performance of its business, we may not continue to realize the licensing revenues from our Japanese licensee in line with its past results, which could negatively impact our net revenues and results of operations. Furthermore, based on its financial performance, our ability to recover our investment in the long term may be limited.\nOur financial results could be adversely impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nDuring Fiscal 2021, we generated approximately 33% of our consolidated net revenues outside the United States. As our international business grows, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Revenues and certain expenses in markets outside of the United States are recognized in local foreign currencies, and we are exposed to potential gains or losses from the translation of those amounts into U.S. dollars for consolidation into our financial statements. Similarly, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. In addition, the business of our independent manufacturers may also be disrupted by currency exchange rate fluctuations by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. As a result, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, we have previously designated cash flow hedges against certain forecasted transactions. If we determine that such a transaction is no longer probable to occur in the time period we expected, we are required to de-designate the hedging relationship and immediately recognize the derivative instrument gain or loss in our earnings. The ongoing impacts of COVID-19 have caused and may continue to cause uncertainty in forecasted cash flows, which has resulted and may continue to result in the de-designation of certain hedged transactions.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nOur business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with these requirements could lead to investigations or actions by government regulators, increased expense or reputational damage.\nOur business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations, including those addressing consumer protection, safety, labeling, distribution, importation, environmental matters, the marketing and sale of our products and other matters. These requirements are enforced by various federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Product Safety Commission and state attorneys general in the United States, as well as by various other federal, state, provincial, local and international regulatory authorities in the locations in which our products are distributed or sold. If we fail to comply with these regulations, we could become subject to significant penalties or claims or be required to stop selling or otherwise recall products, which could negatively impact our results of operations and disrupt our ability to conduct our business, as well as damage our brand image with consumers. In addition, the adoption of new legislation, regulations or industry standards, including related to climate change, or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant unanticipated compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of net revenues.\nOur international operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and U.S. sanctions laws, as well as other anti-bribery and sanctions laws of foreign jurisdictions where we\nconduct business. Although we have policies and procedures to address compliance with the FCPA and similar laws and sanctions requirements, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, agents and other partners will not take actions in violations of our policies or that our procedures will effectively mitigate against such risks. Any such violation could subject us to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results.\nData security or privacy breaches could damage our reputation, cause us to incur additional expense, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe collect sensitive and proprietary business information as well as personally identifiable information in connection with digital marketing, digital commerce, our in-store payment processing systems and our digital business (including our MapMyFitness platform). We collect and store a variety of information regarding our consumers, and on some of our platforms allow users to share their personal information with each other and with third parties. We also rely on third parties for the operation of certain of our e-commerce websites, and do not control these service providers. Like other companies in our industry, we have in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, cyberattacks, including phishing, cyber fraud incidents and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems. These attempted attacks have increased as COVID-19 has progressed and many employees continue to work from home. To date, these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations, but there can be no assurance that they will not have an impact in the future. Any breach of our data security or that of our service providers could result in an unauthorized release or transfer of customer, consumer, vendor or employee information, or the loss of money, valuable business data or cause a disruption in our business. These events could give rise to unwanted media attention, damage our reputation, damage our customer, consumer or user relationships and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. We may also be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against or respond to or alleviate problems caused by a security breach, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe must also comply with increasingly complex and evolving regulatory standards throughout the world enacted to protect personal information and other data, including the General Data Protection Regulation, the ePrivacy Directive, the California Consumer Privacy Act, the California Privacy Rights Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Privacy Act, the Colorado Privacy Act and the Personal Information Protection Law in China. These laws and related regulations impact our ability to engage with our consumers, and some of these privacy laws prohibit the transfer of personal information to certain other jurisdictions. Compliance with existing laws and regulations can be costly and could negatively impact our profitability. Moreover, data privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve and it may be costly for us to adjust our operations to comply with new requirements. Regulatory bodies throughout the world have increased enforcement efforts against companies who fail to comply with privacy requirements. Failure to comply with these regulatory standards could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations and subject us to legal proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, imposition of fines by governmental authorities, negative publicity and damage to our brand image, all of which could have a negative impact on our profitability.\nChanges in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretations and application, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided applicable foreign withholding taxes, certain U.S. state income taxes, or foreign exchange rate impacts.\nMoreover, we also engage in multiple types of intercompany transactions, and our allocation of profits and losses among us and our subsidiaries through our intercompany transfer pricing arrangements are subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service and foreign tax authorities. Although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions in accordance with current rules and regulations, which are generally consistent with the arms-length standard, and the proper documentation is in place, tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may materially impact our tax provision.\nAdditionally, many countries have implemented legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s (\u201cOECD\u201d) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plan, which aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy and include changes to cross-border tax, transfer pricing documentation rules and nexus-based tax incentive practices.\nAs a result of this heightened scrutiny, we may experience an increase in income tax audits and prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities and/or legislative investigation, which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings. Any such activities may result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change, which could have a material impact on our tax provision.\nFurther, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Build Back Better Act in November 2021 and the U.S. Senate Finance Committee has drafted similar legislation. If these or similar legislation is enacted in the United States, it could materially and adversely impact our tax provision, cash tax liability and effective tax rate.\nIn addition, member states of the OECD are continuing discussions surrounding fundamental changes to the taxing rights of governments and allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business. Specifically, the OECD has proposed rules intended to provide governments new taxing rights over the digital economy and specified digital services as well as the implementation of a global minimum tax (\u201cPillar One\u201d and \u201cPillar Two,\u201d respectively). The enactment of the Pillar One and/or Pillar Two Model Rules in jurisdictions where we have operations may have a material impact on our global transfer pricing arrangements and a materially adverse impact on our tax provision, cash tax liability and effective tax rate.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property rights, or our conflict with the rights of others, could damage our brand, weaken our competitive position and negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur success depends in large part on our brand image. We currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade dress, patent, anti-counterfeiting and unfair competition laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. The steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand and intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some jurisdictions. In addition, intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture the majority of our products are generally owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us, and our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to certain of our products.\nFrom time to time, we have brought claims relating to the enforcement of our intellectual property rights against others or have discovered unauthorized products in the marketplace that are either counterfeit reproductions of our products or unauthorized irregulars that do not meet our quality control standards. If we fail to protect, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could decrease and our competitive position may suffer. In addition, from time to time others may seek to enforce infringement claims against us. Successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling or providing some of our products. The resolution of such claims may require us to pull product from the market, redesign our products, license rights belonging to third parties or cease using those rights altogether. Any of these events could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are the subject of a number of ongoing legal proceedings that have resulted in significant expense, and adverse developments in our ongoing proceedings and/or future legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or stock price.\nWe are actively involved in a variety of litigation and other legal matters and may be subject to additional litigations, investigations, arbitration proceedings, audits, regulatory inquiries and similar actions, including matters related to commercial disputes, intellectual property, employment, securities laws, disclosures, environmental, tax, accounting, class action and product liability, as well as trade, regulatory and other claims related to our business and our industry, which we refer to collectively as legal proceedings. For example, we are subject to an ongoing securities class action proceeding regarding our prior disclosures (including regarding the use of \"pull forward\" sales) and derivative complaints regarding related matters, as well as past related party transactions, among other legal proceedings. Refer to Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these specific matters.\nLegal proceedings in general, and securities and class action litigation and regulatory investigations in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. We cannot predict the outcome of any particular legal proceeding, or whether ongoing legal proceedings will be resolved favorably or ultimately result in charges or material damages, fines or other penalties. Our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us, and we are unable to predict how long the legal proceedings to which we are currently subject will continue. An unfavorable outcome of any legal proceeding may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations or\nour stock price. Any legal proceeding could negatively impact our reputation among our customers or our shareholders. Furthermore, publicity surrounding ongoing legal proceedings, even if resolved favorably for us, could result in additional legal proceedings against us, as well as damage our brand image.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nKevin Plank, our Executive Chairman and Brand Chief, controls the majority of the voting power of our common stock.\nOur Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and our Class C common stock has no voting rights (except in limited circumstances). Our Executive Chairman and Brand Chief, Kevin A. Plank, beneficially owns all outstanding shares of Class B common stock. As a result, Mr. Plank has the majority voting control and is able to direct the election of all of the members of our Board of Directors and other matters we submit to a vote of our stockholders. Under certain circumstances, the Class B common stock automatically converts to Class A common stock, which would also result in the conversion of our Class C common stock into Class A common stock. As specified in our charter, these circumstances include when Mr. Plank beneficially owns less than 15.0% of the total number of shares of Class A and Class B common stock outstanding, if Mr. Plank were to resign as an Approved Executive Officer of the Company (or was otherwise terminated for cause) or if Mr. Plank sells more than a specified number of any class of our common stock within a one-year period. This concentration of voting control may have various effects including, but not limited to, delaying or preventing a change of control or allowing us to take action that the majority of our stockholders do not otherwise support. In addition, we utilize shares of our Class C common stock to fund employee equity incentive programs and may do so in connection with future stock-based acquisition transactions, which could prolong the duration of Mr. Plank\u2019s voting control.\nThe trading prices for our Class A and Class C common stock may differ and fluctuate from time to time.\nThe trading prices of our Class A and Class C common stock may differ and fluctuate from time to time in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors may include, among others, overall performance of the equity markets and the economy as a whole, variations in our quarterly results of operations or those of our competitors, our ability to meet our published guidance and securities analyst expectations, or recommendations by securities analysts. In addition, our non-voting Class C common stock has traded at a discount to our Class A common stock, and there can be no assurance that this will not continue.", "PERMNO": 90979, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "UAA"}
