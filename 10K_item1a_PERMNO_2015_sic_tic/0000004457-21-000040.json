Risk Factors\nThe following discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d) and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.\nThese risk factors may be important in understanding this Annual Report or elsewhere.\nThe recent COVID-19\nglobal pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFuture viral pandemics could have similar or more severe effects on our business.\nIn late 2019,\nCOVID-19\nwas first detected in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared\nCOVID-19\na global pandemic, and governmental authorities around the world implemented measures to reduce the spread of\nCOVID-19. Early on the virus, along with mitigation measures, adversely affected workforces, customers, consumer sentiment, economies and financial markets.\nThe combination of customer-initiated changes in behavior, along with state and local jurisdictions imposing shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, executive orders and similar government orders and restrictions to control the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in reduced business activity during the first quarter of fiscal 2021.\nThese events have highlighted several risks to our business resulting from COVID-19 or other potential future pandemics.\nOur locations are considered essential services and have been open and serving communities throughout the current pandemic. There is a risk this may not always be the case.\nAdditionally, our workforce may be negatively impacted by such a pandemic that could lead to disruptions in our ability to serve customers.\nWe are unable to accurately predict the impact that COVID-19 or other such similar outbreaks will have on our operations going forward due to uncertainties which will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue, which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration of COVID-19 and the impact of governmental regulations that might be imposed in response to the pandemic.\nIt is premature to accurately predict the ultimate impact of these developments.\nFor the fiscal year, we saw our first quarter results negatively impacted while our second, third and fourth quarter results showed improvement.\nThere remains uncertainty as to the potential materiality in fiscal 2022.\nTo the extent COVID-19\nadversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, such as those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness, our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness, our fleet rotation program, the manufacturers and suppliers of our rental equipment, our independent dealers and the operation of our rental fleet, sales of our products and operation of our locations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe truck rental industry is highly competitive and includes a number of significant national, regional and local competitors, many of which are several times larger than U-Haul. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of rental locations, availability of quality rental moving equipment, breadth of essential services and products and total cost. Financial results for the Company can be adversely impacted by aggressive pricing from our competitors. Some of our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain existing rental prices or implement price increases. Moreover, if our competitors reduce prices and we are not able or willing to do so as well, we may lose rental volume, which would likely have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. Numerous potential competitors are working to establish paradigm shifting technologies from self-driving vehicles to ride-hailing services and other technologies that connect riders with vehicles.\nThe self-storage industry is large and highly fragmented. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of storage rental locations, cleanliness, security and price. Competition in the market areas in which we operate is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses of our facilities. Competition might cause us to experience a decrease in occupancy levels, limit our ability to raise rental rates or require us to offer discounted rates that would have a material effect on results of operations and financial condition. Entry into the self-storage business may be accomplished through the acquisition of existing facilities by persons or institutions with the required initial capital. Development of new self-storage facilities is more difficult however, due to land use, zoning, environmental and other regulatory requirements. The self-storage industry has in the past experienced overbuilding in response to perceived increases in demand. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete in existing markets or expand into new markets.\nWe are highly leveraged.\nAs of March 31, 2021, we had total debt outstanding of $4,698.6 million and operating lease liabilities of $92.5 million. Although we believe, based on existing information, that additional leverage can be supported by our operations and revenues, our existing debt could impact us in the following ways among other considerations:\nrequire us to allocate a considerable portion of cash flows from operations to debt service and lease payments;\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing; and\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt.\nOur ability to make payments on our debt and leases depends upon our ability to maintain and improve our operating performance and generate cash flow. To some extent, this is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt and meet our other cash needs, including our leases, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness and leases. If we must sell our assets, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue. In addition, we may incur additional debt or leases that would exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness.\nUncertainty regarding LIBOR may adversely impact our indebtedness under our credit and loan facilities.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021.\nIn addition, in April 2018, the Federal Reserve System, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, announced the replacement of LIBOR with a new index, calculated by short-term repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). At this time, it is not possible to predict whether SOFR will attain market traction as a LIBOR replacement.\nIn November 2020 the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and other groups announced that LIBOR reporting will cease being published in June 2023.\nPotential changes, or uncertainty related to such potential changes, may adversely affect the market for LIBOR-based securities, including our portfolio of LIBOR-indexed, floating-rate debt securities, or the cost of our borrowings. In addition, changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the market for LIBOR-based securities, including the value of the LIBOR-indexed, floating-rate debt securities in our portfolio, or the cost of our borrowings. We believe our LIBOR-indexed debt maturing after June 2023 will need to be renegotiated.\nThe potential effect of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR on our cost of capital and net investment income cannot yet be determined.\nEconomic conditions, including those related to the credit markets, may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.\nConsumer and commercial spending is generally affected by the health of the economy, which places some of the factors affecting the success of our business beyond our control. Our businesses, although not as traditionally cyclical as some, could experience significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions. In times of declining consumer spending we may be driven, along with our competitors, to reduce pricing, which would have a negative impact on gross profit.\nWe cannot predict if another downturn in the economy will occur, which could result in reduced revenues and working capital.\nTrends in the economy could result in inflationary pressures leading to an increase in our cost of doing business. We cannot guarantee that we can manage the costs lower or pass them along in the form of higher prices to our customers.\nShould credit markets in the United States tighten or if interest rates increase significantly, we may not be able to refinance existing debt or find additional financing on favorable terms, if at all.\nIf one or more of the financial institutions that support our existing credit facilities fails or opts not to continue to lend to us, we may not be able to find a replacement, which would negatively impact our ability to borrow under credit facilities.\nIf our operating results were to worsen significantly and our cash flows or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates increase significantly, we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur fleet rotation program can be adversely affected by financial market conditions.\nTo meet the needs of our customers, U-Haul maintains a large fleet of rental equipment. Our rental truck fleet rotation program is funded internally through operations and externally from debt and lease financing. Our ability to fund our routine fleet rotation program could be adversely affected if financial market conditions limit the general availability of external financing. This could lead us to operate trucks longer than initially planned and/or reduce the size of the fleet, either of which could materially and negatively affect our results of operations.\nAnother important aspect of our fleet rotation program is the sale of used rental equipment. The sale of used equipment provides us with funds that can be used to purchase new equipment. Conditions may arise that could lead to the decrease in demand and/or resale values for our used equipment. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, which could result in substantial losses on the sale of equipment and decreases in cash flows from the sales of equipment.\nWe obtain our rental trucks from a limited number of manufacturers.\nOver the last twenty years, we purchased the majority of our rental trucks from Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation. Our fleet can be negatively affected by issues our manufacturers may face within their own supply chain. Also, it is possible that our suppliers may face financial difficulties or organizational changes which could negatively impact their ability to accept future orders or fulfill existing orders. The cost of acquiring new rental trucks could increase materially and negatively affect our ability to rotate new equipment into the fleet. Although we believe that we could contract with alternative manufacturers for our rental trucks, we cannot guarantee or predict how long that would take. In addition, termination of our existing relationship with these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations for an indefinite period of time.\nA substantial amount of our shares is owned by a small contingent of stockholders.\nWillow Grove Holdings LP, directly and through controlled entities (\u201cWGHLP\u201d), owns 8,342,849 shares of AMERCO common stock, and together with Edward J. Shoen and Mark V. Shoen, owns 8,390,138 shares (approximately 42.8%) of AMERCO common stock.\nThe general partner of WGHLP controls the voting and disposition decisions with respect to the common stock of AMERCO owned by WGHLP, and is managed by Edward J. Shoen (the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of AMERCO) and his brother, Mark V. Shoen.\nAccordingly,\nEdward J. Shoen\nand\nMark V. Shoen\nare in a position to significantly influence\nour business and policies, including the approval of\ncertain\nsignificant transactions, the election of the members of\nour\nBoard\nof Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d)\nand other matters submitted to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that their\ninterests will not conflict with the interests\nof our other stockholders.\nIn addition, 951,188 shares (approximately 4.9%) of AMERCO common stock are owned under our ESOP.\nEach ESOP participant is entitled to vote the shares allocated to himself or herself in their discretion.\nIn the event an ESOP participant does not vote his or her shares, such shares shall be voted by the ESOP trustee, in the ESOP trustee's discretion.\nOur operations subject us to numerous environmental regulations and the possibility that environmental liability in the future could adversely affect our operations.\nCompliance with environmental requirements of federal, state and local governments significantly affects our business. Among other things, these requirements regulate the discharge of materials into the air, land and water and govern the use and disposal of hazardous substances. Under environmental laws or common law principles, we can be held liable for hazardous substances that are found on real property we have owned or operated. We are aware of issues regarding hazardous substances on some of our real estate and we have put in place a remediation plan at each site where we believe such a plan is necessary. See Note 19, Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We regularly make capital and operating expenditures to stay in compliance with environmental laws. In particular, we have managed a testing and removal program since 1988 for our underground storage tanks.\nDespite these compliance efforts, the risk of environmental liability is part of the nature of our business.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. We cannot assure you that future compliance with these regulations, future environmental liabilities, the cost of defending environmental claims, conducting any environmental remediation or generally resolving liabilities caused by us or related third parties will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and changes in existing regulations or violations of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nOur truck and trailer rental business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign governmental entities. Specifically, the U.S. Department of Transportation and various state, federal and Canadian agencies exercise broad powers over our motor carrier operations, safety, and the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste materials. In addition, our storage business is also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent such property or to use the property as collateral for future borrowings. Compliance with changing regulations could substantially impair real property and equipment productivity and increase our costs. In addition, the federal government may institute some regulation that limits carbon emissions by setting a maximum amount of carbon individual entities can emit without penalty. This would likely affect everyone who uses fossil fuels and would disproportionately affect users in the highway transportation industries. While there are too many variables at this time to assess the impact of the various proposed federal and state regulations that could affect carbon emissions, many experts believe these proposed rules could significantly affect the way companies operate in their businesses.\nThe Biden administration has communicated its willingness to consider the imposition of carbon-based taxes.\nOur truck rental fleet burns gasoline, a carbon intensive fuel.\nWhere in the supply chain and in what amount these taxes could arise is uncertain.\nWe have no evidence to support a belief that \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d moving customers are willing to accept these additional costs.\nShould such a tax be enacted, we could see an increase in expenses, including compliance costs and a negative effect on our operating margin.\nOur operations can be limited by land-use regulations. Zoning choices enacted by individual municipalities in the United States and Canada may limit our ability to serve certain markets with our products and services.\nOur insurance companies are heavily regulated by state insurance departments and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These insurance regulations are primarily in place to protect the interests of our policyholders and not our investors. Changes in these laws and regulations could increase our costs, inhibit new sales, or limit our ability to implement rate increases.\nA significant portion of our revenues are generated through third-parties.\nOur business plan relies upon a network of independent dealers strategically located throughout the United States and Canada.\nAs of March 31, 2021 we had nearly 21,100 independent equipment rental dealers.\nIn fiscal 2021, less than half of all U-Move \u00ae rental revenue originated through this network.\nOur inability to maintain this network or its current cost structure could inhibit our ability to adequately serve our customers and may negatively affect our results of operations and financial position.\nThe introduction or expansion of regulations favoring electric, autonomous, connected and shared vehicles may negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nRegulatory pressure in connection with the introduction and expansion of electric, autonomous and connected rental vehicles could negatively impact our cost of acquisition for rental trucks and require infrastructure improvements that could inhibit our current business model.\nOur Company operated-locations and independent dealer network may require physical upgrades to accommodate these types of vehicles that are uneconomical and/or unachievable.\nOur one-way rental business would depend on an in-transit recharging network that simply does not exist today, and when completed, may be so costly or require so much charging time as to substantially limit our ability to serve customers needing to move long distances.\nOur repair and maintenance infrastructures, including both physical plant as well as personnel, may be inappropriate for these new types of vehicles.\nWithout such maintenance capabilities it could compromise our ability to operate such a fleet of compliant vehicles.\nThere is risk inherent in our ability to prepare for these possibilities.\nWe cooperate with original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEM\u201cs), maintain and train our own technical experts and operate an equipment Technical Center that has positioned us as an industry leader in innovation for over fifty years.\nThe proposed changes to electric, autonomous and connected vehicles raises challenges of enormous scale.\nWe necessarily may also be dependent upon third party providers who may not be able to provide workable solutions.\nThe growing insistence that the future of the economy will be based on an all-electric solution instead of a hybrid version or other alternative fuels may create an infrastructure in which personal interstate travel will be uneconomical or severely regulated.\nThis would impact the moving business.\nThere may be areas of North America where a charging grid with adequate capacity for our customers may not exist.\nU-Haul has already made significant progress on several initiatives aimed at these future possibilities including: TruckShare 24/7, contactless rentals, a North American propane alternative fuel network, alternative fuel test vehicles and close OEM working relationships.\nGovernment regulators may knowingly or unknowingly choose the winners and losers in this evolving transportation environment.\nThere remains a possibility that governments may not select U-Haul customers and U-Haul to be among the winners.\nWe face liability risks associated with the operation of our rental fleet, sales of our products and operation of our locations.\nThe business of renting moving and storage equipment to customers exposes us to liability claims including property damage, personal injury and even death. Likewise, the operation of our moving and storage centers along with the sale of our related moving supplies, towing accessories and installation, and refilling of propane tanks may subject us to liability claims.\nWe seek to limit the occurrence of such events through the design of our equipment, communication of its proper use, exhaustive repair and maintenance schedules, extensive training of our personnel, proactive risk management assessments and by providing our customers with online resources for the proper use of products and services.\nRegardless, accidents still occur and we manage the financial risk of these events through third party insurance carriers. While these excess loss and property insurance policies are available today at reasonable costs, this could change and could negatively affect our results of operations and financial position.\nTerrorist attacks could negatively impact our operations and profitability and may expose us to liability and reputational damage.\nTerrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and profitability.\nSuch attacks may damage our facilities and it is also possible that our rental equipment could be involved in a terrorist attack.\nAlthough we carry excess of loss insurance coverage, it may prove to be insufficient to cover us for acts of terror using our rental equipment.\nMoreover, we may suffer reputational damage that could arise from a terrorist attack which utilizes our rental equipment. The consequences of any terrorist attacks or hostilities are unpredictable and difficult to quantify.\nWe seek to minimize these risks through our operational processes and procedures; however, we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nWe are highly dependent upon our automated systems and the Internet for managing our business.\nOur information systems are largely Internet-based, including our point-of-sale reservation system, payment processing and telephone systems.\nWhile our reliance on this technology lowers our cost of providing service and expands our abilities to better serve customers, it exposes us to various risks including natural and man-made disasters, terrorist attacks and cyber-attacks.\nWe have put into place extensive security protocols, backup systems and alternative procedures to mitigate these risks.\nHowever, disruptions or breaches, detected or undetected by us, for any period of time in any portion of these systems could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and inflict reputational damage.\nIn addition, the provision of service to our customers and the operation of our networks and systems involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of customers, system members and others. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, malicious insiders, or catastrophic events. Hackers, acting individually or in coordinated groups, may also launch distributed denial of service attacks or ransom or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages or other interruptions in our business and access to our data.\nIn addition, breaches in security could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected, to a risk of loss or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect for a long time and often are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nAny of these occurrences could result in disruptions in our operations, the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to our brand and reputation, and litigation and potential liability for the Company. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data or system protection measures could be significant and our efforts to deter, identify, mitigate and/or eliminate any security breaches may not be successful.\nA.M. Best financial strength ratings are crucial to our life insurance business.\nIn July 2020, A.M. Best affirmed the financial strength rating for Oxford and Christian Fidelity Life Insurance Company (\u201cCFLIC\u201d) of A- and affirmed the outlook is positive and affirmed the financial strength rating for North American Insurance Company (\u201cNAI\u201d) of B++ with a stable outlook. Financial strength ratings are important external factors that can affect the success of Oxford's business plans. Accordingly, if Oxford's ratings, relative to its competitors, are not maintained or do not continue to improve, Oxford may not be able to retain and attract business as currently planned, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may incur losses due to our reinsurers' or counterparties' failure to perform under existing contracts or we may be unable to secure sufficient reinsurance or hedging protection in the future.\nWe use reinsurance and derivative contracts to mitigate our risk of loss in various circumstances; primarily at Repwest and for Moving and Storage. These agreements do not release us from our primary obligations and therefore we remain ultimately responsible for these potential costs. We cannot provide assurance that these reinsurers or counterparties will fulfill their obligations. Their inability or unwillingness to make payments to us under the terms of the contracts may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Repwest reported $0.3 million of reinsurance recoverables, net of allowances and $64.9 million of reserves and liabilities ceded to reinsurers. Of this, Repwest's largest exposure to a single reinsurer was $39.4 million.\nRecent changes to U.S. tax laws may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations and create the risk that we may need to adjust our accounting for these changes.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Reform Act\u201d) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) made significant changes to U.S. tax laws and includes numerous provisions that affect businesses, including ours.\nFor instance, as a result of lower corporate tax rates, the Tax Reform Act tends to reduce both the value of deferred tax assets and the amount of deferred tax liabilities.\nIt also limits interest expense deductions and the amount of net operating losses that can be used each year and alters the expensing of capital expenditures. Other provisions have international tax consequences for businesses like ours that operate internationally. The CARES Act allows for the carryback of certain net operating losses. The Tax Reform Act is unclear in certain respects and will require interpretations and implementing regulations by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as state tax authorities, and the Tax Reform Act and CARES Act could be subject to amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase the adverse (and positive) impacts of these acts. The accounting treatment of these tax law changes was complex, and some of the changes affected both current and future periods.\nOthers primarily affected future periods.\nAdditional changes to the U.S. tax code could negatively offset operating cashflows.", "PERMNO": 81073, "SIC": 7510, "TIC": "UHAL"}
