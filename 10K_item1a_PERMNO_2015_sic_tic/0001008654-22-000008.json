{"cik": "1008654", "company": "TUPPERWARE BRANDS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThere are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with the Company that could adversely affect its business, financial condition, or results of operations. Set forth below are descriptions of those risks and uncertainties that the Company currently believes to be material, but the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that could adversely affect the Company. Other events that the Company does not currently anticipate or that the Company currently deems immaterial also may affect its business, financial condition, or results of operations. Before making an investment in the Company\u2019s securities, investors should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below, together with the other information in this Report, including the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and the other reports and materials filed by the Company with the SEC.\nRisks Related to Internal Controls\nIf the Company is unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of the Company's financial reports and the Company's results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nThe accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our stockholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. We rely on our employees to design, manage, and operate our systems and controls to assure that we properly enter into, record, and manage processes, transactions, and other relationships with customers, suppliers, and other parties with whom we do business. We also depend on employees and the systems and controls for which they are responsible to assure that we identify and mitigate the risks that are inherent in our relationships and activities. Thus, we are exposed to risks that include, but are not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside the Company, the execution of incorrect or unauthorized transactions by employees or others, errors relating to transaction processing, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, unplanned interruptions in service, and vendors that do not perform in accordance with their contractual agreements. Certain of these types of activities were identified in the course of the Company\u2019s review of its Mexico operations and are the subject of an SEC inquiry. See \"Risks Related to Internal Controls - The ongoing SEC inquiry and any potential related litigation entail risks and uncertainties\" for more information. Failure to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements or a delay in our ability to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nAs previously disclosed, in connection with the preparation of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2020, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting with respect to the fiscal year ended December 26, 2020, and if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner could be adversely affected, investor confidence in our Company could diminish, and the value of our common stock may decline.\nThe Company must comply with a number of legal and regulatory requirements, including those under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, which requires us, among other things, to assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and the reasonable assurance level of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act annually. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse if it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed, or operating. Moreover, our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. If material weaknesses are identified or we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, our reported financial results could be materially misstated or could subsequently require restatement, we could receive an adverse opinion regarding our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm, we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities, and we could incur substantial expenses. We may not be able to effectively implement system and process changes required for new standards on a timely basis. Any delays or failure to update our systems and processes could also lead to a material weakness or significant deficiency.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As previously disclosed, and as described further in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures, the Company had previously concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 26, 2020 due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting related to the control environment at the Fuller Mexico operations and Tupperware Mexico operations, due to override by local management of certain internal controls, which aggregated to material weaknesses in the control environment at the Mexico operations as of December 26, 2020.\nAs further described in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures, the Company successfully remediated its material weaknesses during the fiscal year 2021. However, if the Company is otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, the ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and within required time periods, could be adversely affected. This could subject the Company to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in the Company\u2019s financial statements, and adversely impact its stock price. See \"Item 9A: Controls and Procedures\" for further discussion on these material weaknesses and remedial actions.\nWe are unable to predict the outcome of the ongoing SEC inquiry and any potential related litigation.\nThe SEC is conducting an inquiry into the Company\u2019s accounting practices relating to its Mexico operations. The Company is fully cooperating with the SEC. As the SEC inquiry is ongoing, the Company is unable to predict how long the inquiry will continue or whether, at its conclusion, the SEC will bring an enforcement action against the Company and, if it does, what fines or other remedies it may seek. There can be no assurance that the SEC or another regulatory body will not make further regulatory inquiries or pursue action against the Company and its senior officers that could result in potentially significant sanctions and penalties, or that could require the Company to take additional remedial steps. Potential sanctions against the Company and/or individuals could include penalties, injunctions, and cease-and-desist orders. Furthermore, publicity surrounding the inquiry or any enforcement action that may result from it could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Accordingly, the ongoing SEC inquiry and any potential related litigation could result in distraction to management and entail risks and uncertainties the outcome of which could adversely affect our financial results and our reputation.\nThe outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and damage our reputation.\nWe are a party to claims and litigation in the normal course of business. Furthermore, the Company may face material litigation outside the ordinary course of business that could materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. In February 2020, putative stockholder class actions were filed against the Company and certain current and former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Central District of California and in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. The actions were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, and a lead plaintiff was appointed. On July 31, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint, which alleges that statements in public filings between January 31, 2018 and February 24, 2020 (the \"potential class period\") regarding the Company\u2019s disclosure of controls and procedures, as well as the need for an amendment of its credit facility, violated Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Act of 1934. The plaintiffs seek to represent a class of stockholders who purchased the Company\u2019s stock during the potential class period and demand unspecified monetary damages. The Company's motion to dismiss the complaint was granted on January 25, 2021, but the court permitted the lead plaintiff to file an amended complaint, which the plaintiff filed on February 16, 2021. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint on April 2, 2021. The court granted the Company\u2019s motion to dismiss the second amended complaint on August 9, 2021, but again permitted the lead plaintiff to file an amended complaint, which the plaintiff filed on August 30, 2021. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the third amended complaint on October 14, 2021, and on February 4, 2022, the Court dismissed the third amended complaint with prejudice. The plaintiff may decide to appeal the dismissal. The Company continues to believe the complaints and allegations to be without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the actions. The Company is unable at this time to determine whether the outcome of these actions would have a material impact on its results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nAdditionally, several putative stockholders filed stockholder derivative complaints in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida against certain of the Company\u2019s current and former officers and directors. The cases were consolidated, and plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint on August 5, 2020. The consolidated amended complaint asserts claims against certain current and former officers and directors for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and contribution for violations of the securities laws based on allegations that the officers and directors allowed the Company to make false or misleading statements in violation of the securities laws. The Court stayed proceedings in this action pending resolution of the third motion to dismiss in the putative stockholder class action. A similar stockholder derivative complaint was filed in the Ninth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida. The parties reached an agreement to stay this action pending the resolution of the third motion to dismiss in the putative stockholder class action. The Company is unable at this time to determine whether the outcome of these actions would have a material impact on its results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nLegal proceedings in general, and securities and class action litigation and regulatory investigations in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us, and we are unable to predict how long the legal proceedings to which we are currently subject will continue. An unfavorable outcome of any legal proceeding may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, or our stock price. Any proceeding could negatively impact our reputation among our customers or our shareholders. Furthermore, publicity surrounding ongoing legal proceedings, even if resolved favorably for us, could result in additional legal proceedings against us, as well as damage our brand image.\nRisks Related to our Operations\nOur success depends, in part, on the quality and safety of our products.\nCertain of the materials used in the Company\u2019s product lines may give rise to concerns of consumers based upon scientific theories which are espoused from time to time, including the risk of certain materials leaching out of plastic containers used for their intended purposes or the ingredients used in cosmetics, personal care, or nutritional products causing harm to human health. This includes polycarbonate, which contains the chemical Bisphenol A, and polyethersulfone, which contains the chemical Bisphenol S. It is the Company\u2019s policy to market products in each of its business units containing only those materials or ingredients that are approved by relevant regulatory authorities for contact with food or skin or for ingestion by consumers, as applicable.\nProduct safety or quality failures, actual or perceived, or allegations of product contamination, even when false or unfounded, or inclusion of regulated ingredients could tarnish the image of our brands and could cause consumers to choose other products. Allegations of contamination, allergens, or other adverse effects on product safety or suitability for use by a particular consumer, even if untrue, may require us from time to time to recall a product from all of the markets in which the affected production was distributed. Such issues or recalls and any related litigation could negatively affect our profitability and brand image.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations that expose us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs.\nThe Company operates manufacturing facilities in the United States and around the world, and is subject to numerous environmental regulations with respect to the operation of those facilities. If the Company were to experience a material adverse environmental event at one of those facilities, or if the Company were to experience any material product safety issue or other significant issue with respect to its products or resins, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nFurthermore, concern over plastics products may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate impacts to the environment. Increased regulatory requirements, including in relation to various aspects of ESG including disclosure requirements, or environmental causes may result in increased compliance or input costs of raw materials, which may cause disruptions in the manufacture of our products or an increase in operating costs. If the Company does not adapt to or comply with new regulations, or fails to meet evolving investor, industry, or stakeholder expectations and standards, or if the Company is perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products from another company or a competitor, and the Company\u2019s reputation, business, or financial condition may be adversely affected.\nSecurity incidents and attacks on our information technology systems could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could harm our business, financial results, and reputation.\nThe Company relies extensively on information technology systems to conduct its business, some of which are managed by third-party service providers. These systems include, but are not limited to, programs and processes relating to internal communications and communications with other parties, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, receiving orders and shipping product to customers, billing customers and receiving and applying payments, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, collecting and storing certain customer, employee, investor, and other stakeholder information and personal data, and other processes necessary to manage the Company\u2019s business. Current and increased information technology security threats, and current and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, pose a risk to the security of the information technology systems, networks, and services of the Company, its customers and other business partners, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data of the Company, its customers and other business partners. Furthermore, the risk of a cybersecurity incident is heightened as more of the Company\u2019s employees work remotely. As a result, the Company\u2019s information technology systems, networks, or service providers could be damaged or cease to function properly or the Company could suffer a loss or disclosure of business, personal, or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, including catastrophic events, power outages and security breaches. Although the Company has business continuity plans in place, if these plans do not provide effective alternative processes on a timely basis, the Company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage or conduct its operations, which may adversely affect its business. The Company may need to expend additional resources in the future to continue to protect against, or to address problems caused by, any business interruptions or data security breaches. Any business interruptions or data security breaches, including cyber-security breaches resulting in private data disclosure, could result in lawsuits or regulatory proceedings, damage the Company\u2019s reputation or adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that could cover some of these types of issues, the coverage has limitations and includes deductibles such that it may not be adequate to offset losses incurred. The Company has experienced various security threats and incidents, including, for example, email compromise\nevents, vulnerabilities, malware, phishing, and non-compliance with internal security requirements and procedures, that have not had a material impact on the Company; however, if the Company were to experience material threats or incidents in the future, there could be significant costs and disruptions that could harm the Company's business, financial results, and reputation.\nThe Company could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems or software are defective, not installed properly, or not properly integrated into its operations, as well as if the capacity and system limitations of the Company\u2019s information technology systems or software are exceeded due to the number of the Company\u2019s employees working from home during COVID-19 restrictions. Various measures have been implemented to manage the risks related to the implementation and modification of hardware and software, but any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of new or upgraded information technology systems or software could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. The Company is continuing to upgrade its systems on a worldwide basis, and as disclosed in \"Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" in 2020 the Company incurred a $30.5 million write-off of capitalized software implementation costs related to the front and back office standardization project that was initiated in 2017, due to a shift in the business model and digital strategy set forward by the new leadership team.\nCurrent and future indebtedness could restrict our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take specified actions.\nThe Company must meet certain financial covenants as defined in the applicable agreements to borrow under its credit facilities. In the event the Company fails to comply with any of the covenants or to meet its payment obligations, it could lead to an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations. The Company may not have sufficient working capital or liquidity to satisfy its debt obligations in the event of an acceleration of all or a portion of its outstanding obligations. If the Company\u2019s cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund its debt service obligations, it may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance its indebtedness. The Company\u2019s ability to restructure or refinance its debt in the future will depend on market conditions and the Company\u2019s financial performance at such time. Any refinancing, if at all, of the Company\u2019s debt could be at higher interest rates and may require the Company to comply with more covenants, which could further restrict its business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict the Company from adopting some of these alternatives.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a new credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other lenders party to such credit agreement. The new credit agreement provides for (i) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount available to the Company and the subsidiary borrowers of up to $480 million, (ii) a term facility available to the Company in U.S. dollars in an aggregate principal amount of $200 million and (iii) a term facility available to the Company and the or the Swiss subsidiary borrower in Euros in an aggregate principal amount of \u20ac176 million. The revolving facility is divided into (a) global tranche, Mexican tranche, and Singaporean tranche commitments, with the aggregate amount of borrowings under each tranche not to exceed $450 million, $15 million, and $15 million, respectively, (b) a global tranche letter of credit facility, available up to $50 million of the amount of the revolving facility, and (c) a global tranche swingline facility, available up to $100 million of the amount of the revolving facility. Each of such tranches is available to the Company and the applicable subsidiary borrowers, with extensions of credit to the subsidiary borrowers not to exceed $325 million in the aggregate at any time outstanding. The Company is permitted to increase, subject to certain conditions, the revolving facility, the U.S. term facility and/or the Euro term facility so long as (i) the revolving facility is increased by no more than $250 million (for a maximum aggregate revolving facility of $730 million) and (ii) all facilities are increased by no more than $250 million, plus certain repayments of the loans under the credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and the other parties, plus an unlimited amount provided that the incurrence of such amount does not cause the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement and which shall be calculated net of up to $100 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (\"Cash Netting\")) for the four (4) consecutive fiscal quarters then most recently ended to exceed 3.00 to 1.00. Each of the Revolving Facility, the U.S. Term Facility, and the Euro Term Facility will mature on November 23, 2026. As the Company's debt approaches maturity, if the Company is unable to refinance its new credit facility, or if the Company refinances its indebtedness on terms that are less favorable than those currently contained in the credit facility, the Company\u2019s liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s Tupperware trademark is collateral under the new credit facility. The Company\u2019s iconic Tupperware brand has worldwide recognition, and the Company\u2019s continuing success, including the value of its collateral under the new credit facility, depends on its ability to maintain and enhance its brand protection, image, and reputation. Maintaining, promoting, and growing the Tupperware brand will depend on design and marketing efforts, sales force and consumer promotions and campaigns, product innovation, and product quality. The Company\u2019s commitment to product innovation and quality and its continuing investment in design and brand awareness may not have the desired impact on its brand image and reputation. In addition, the Company\u2019s success in maintaining, extending, and expanding its brand image depends on its ability to adapt to a rapidly changing social media environment\nand digital dissemination of branding campaigns. The Company could be adversely impacted if it fails to achieve any of these objectives.\nWe may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of the Turnaround Plan and other operating or cost-saving initiatives, which may negatively impact our profitability.\nIn 2020, the Company accelerated transformation initiatives, initiated in the past few years, and developed a comprehensive Turnaround Plan. As the Company works to implement the Turnaround Plan, it may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from one or more of the various restructuring and cost-savings programs undertaken as part of these efforts in full or in part or within the time periods expected. It also may not realize the increase in sales intended to be enabled by the initiatives. The Company\u2019s ability to improve its operating results depends upon a significant number of factors, some of which are beyond its control. Other events and circumstances, such as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, financial and strategic difficulties and delays or unexpected costs, including the impact of foreign currency and inflationary pressures, may occur which could result in not realizing targets or in offsetting the financial benefits of reaching those targets. Reaching those targets may also depend on the level of acceptance by the Company\u2019s sales force of its compensation initiatives. The Company might also experience a decline in revenue in the short-term as part of the implementation of the Turnaround Plan, with the goal of increasing profits in the future. If the Company is unable to realize the anticipated savings or benefits, or otherwise fails to invest in the growth initiatives, the business may be adversely affected. In addition, any plans to invest these savings and benefits ahead of future growth means that such costs will be incurred whether or not these savings and benefits are realized. The Company is also subject to the risks of labor unrest, negative publicity, and business disruption in connection with these initiatives, and the failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from such initiatives could have a material adverse effect on business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFurthermore, success of the Turnaround Plan depends on the Company\u2019s ability to compete with other companies in the same markets. The business of marketing the Company\u2019s products is highly competitive and sensitive to the introduction of new products, which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market. These market segments include numerous manufacturers, distributors, marketers, and retailers that actively compete for the business of consumers both in the United States and abroad. In addition, the Company is subject to increasing competition from sellers that utilize digital platforms. Some of these competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, product development, marketing, and sales resources, more innovative sales channels or platforms, greater name recognition, larger established customer bases, and better-developed distribution channels than the Company does. The Company\u2019s present or future competitors may be able to develop products that are comparable or superior to those offered by the Company, adapt more quickly than the Company does to new technologies, evolving industry trends and standards or customer requirements, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products than the Company does. For example, if the Company\u2019s competitors develop other products to help store, serve, and prepare food that prove to be more effective than the Company\u2019s products, demand for Company\u2019s products could be reduced. Accordingly, competition may intensify and the Company may not be able to compete effectively in its markets.\nRisks Related to Our Business Model\nThe Company is largely dependent upon the independent sales organizations and individuals to reach end consumers, and any significant disruption of this distribution network may materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company is largely dependent upon the independent sales organizations and individuals to reach end consumers, and any significant disruption of this distribution network would have a negative financial impact on the Company and its ability to generate sales, earnings, and operating cash flows. The Company\u2019s distribution system depends upon successful addition, activation, and retention of a large number of independent sales force members. The addition, retention, and activation of sales force members is dependent upon the competitive environment among other companies who also use this channel of distribution and upon the general labor market, unemployment levels, general economic conditions, demographic and cultural changes in the workforce and the level of penetration of the Company\u2019s sales force in the geographies in which it operates, as well as the introduction of new products.\nThe Company\u2019s sales are directly tied to the activity levels of its sales force, which is in large part a temporary working activity for many sales force members. Activity levels may be affected by the degree to which a market is penetrated by the presence of the Company\u2019s sales force, the amount of average sales per order, the amount of sales per sales force member, the mix of high-margin and low-margin products sold at group demonstrations and elsewhere, and the activities and actions of the Company\u2019s product line and channel competitors. The Company\u2019s sales force members may be affected by initiatives undertaken by the Company to grow its revenue base or change its cost base which may lead to the inaccurate perception that the independent sales force system is at risk of being phased out or the Company intends to exit markets.\nFurthermore, due to the high level of competition in the Company\u2019s industry, the Company might fail to retain its independent sales force and their customers, which would harm the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. The Company is subject to significant competition for the recruitment of independent sales force from other direct selling businesses. We compete globally for\npotential customers and independent sales force, and if we are unable to successfully compete with other direct selling and related businesses, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on our sales force to adapt to changing consumer needs.\nThe Company currently has sales derived from channels other than direct selling. The reliance on this dominant channel in an environment where the consumer expects a frictionless experience could impact the Company\u2019s business. Furthermore, reliance on this dominant channel was impacted by the pandemic, and while the Company\u2019s sales force was able to utilize digital tools and social media to compensate for quarantine restrictions, this sales channel could be impacted further if other avenues for communicating with customers are unavailable.\nOur ability to improve our financial performance depends on our ability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to changes in consumer trends and demands such as the types of products and materials the Company offers, the ease of finding and ordering the product, and the speed at which the products can be delivered. Consumer preferences and trends may change due to a variety of factors, such as changes in demographic trends, changes in the characteristics and materials used in our products, new market trends, or a weak economy in one or more of the markets in which we operate. The Company\u2019s ability to accurately predict and respond to these changes could impact the Company\u2019s financial results. If we are unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products.\nIf we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of products to deliver to our customers. The Company has experienced, and may continue to experience, challenges in supplying products to meet customer demands, and might not be able to modify its internal systems, business practices, supply chain arrangements, and logistical support mechanisms quickly enough to meet these demands. If the Company is unsuccessful in keeping pace with these demands, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be materially adversely effected.\nWe are subject to financial risks as a result of our international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, the impact of foreign currency restrictions, and the impact of international sanctions.\nThe Company is subject to risks of doing business internationally. The Company has derived, for a number of years, most of its net sales from operations outside the United States. As a result, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international operations are translated from local currency into U.S. dollars.\nMovement in exchange rates has had and may continue to have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s earnings, cash flows, and financial position. The Company\u2019s most significant exposures are to the Brazilian Real, Chinese Renminbi, Argentine Peso, Euro, Indonesian Rupiah, Malaysian Ringgit, Mexican Peso, and South African Rand. Although the Company\u2019s currency risk is partially mitigated by the natural hedge arising from its local product sourcing in many markets, a strengthening United States Dollar generally has a negative impact on the Company. In response to this fact, the Company continues to implement foreign currency hedging and risk management strategies to reduce the exposure to fluctuations in earnings associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company generally does not seek to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on the translated value of the sales, profit, or cash flow generated by its operations. Some of the hedging strategies implemented have a positive or negative impact on cash flows as foreign currencies fluctuate versus the United States Dollar. There can be no assurance that foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities will not have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition.\nFurthermore, foreign governments may impose restrictions on currency remittances. Due to the possibility of government restrictions (or existing restrictions) on transfers of cash out of countries and control of exchange rates and currency convertibility, the Company may not be able to immediately access its cash at the exchange rate used to translate its financial statements.\nIn addition, the United States government may impose material sanctions and restrictions on doing business with certain countries, businesses, and individuals, including potential sanctions against countries such as Russia or within the Ukraine region, and potential military conflict or instability in the Ukraine region could occur. Such events could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and financial performance, including through increased costs of compliance, restrictions on the Company's ability to sell into specific regions of the World, higher volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, and increased input costs (such as energy).\nRisks associated with our international operations and sales and changes in economic environments could adversely affect our business and earnings.\nAn economic slowdown in any of the countries where the Company operates could materially affect the Company\u2019s revenues and operating results. Although these operations are geographically dispersed, which partially mitigates the risks associated with operating in particular countries, the Company is subject to the usual risks associated with international operations. Among others, these risks include local political and economic environments, adverse new tax regulations, potentially burdensome privacy protocols, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation, and relations between the United States and foreign governments. In addition, the Company does business in developing countries, some of which have higher risk profiles, and some of the international jurisdictions in which the Company operates have a different, or less developed, legal system that lacks transparency in certain respects relative to that of the United States, and can accord local government authorities a higher degree of control and discretion over business than is customary in the United States.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar U.S. or foreign anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nThe Company operates in many different jurisdictions, including jurisdictions that are considered high-risk countries, and the Company could be adversely affected by violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws. The FCPA and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The Company\u2019s internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. The Company operates in many parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite the Company\u2019s training and compliance programs, the Company cannot assure you that its internal control policies and procedures always will protect the Company from reckless or criminal acts committed by Company\u2019s employees or agents. The Company\u2019s continued expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations in the future. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt the Company\u2019s business and result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nOur ability to conduct business in our international markets may be affected by political, legal, tax and regulatory risks.\nThe Company\u2019s global operations expose the Company to a number of additional risks, including:\n\u2022changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political, social, or economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets;\n\u2022civil unrest, turmoil, or outbreak of disease or illness, such as the novel coronavirus, in any of the countries in which we sell our products or in which we or our suppliers operate;\n\u2022tariffs, other trade protection measures, as discussed in more detail below, and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022potential adverse changes in trade agreements between the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022uncertainty and potentially negative consequences relating to the implementation of the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the European Union (\"Brexit\");\n\u2022potentially negative consequences from changes in United States and international tax laws;\n\u2022difficulty in staffing and managing geographically widespread operations;\n\u2022differing labor regulations;\n\u2022requirements relating to withholding taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u2022different regulatory regimes controlling the protection of our intellectual property;\n\u2022restrictions on our ability to own or operate subsidiaries, make investments or acquire new businesses in these jurisdictions;\n\u2022restrictions on our ability to repatriate dividends from our foreign subsidiaries;\n\u2022difficulty in collecting international accounts receivable;\n\u2022difficulty in enforcement of contractual obligations not within United States legal jurisdiction;\n\u2022transportation delays or interruptions;\n\u2022changes in regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022the burden of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws, including, but not limited to, conflicting labor and employment laws.\nSee \"Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for further discussion regarding these risks.\nEvolving global regulations on direct selling companies could harm our business and financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s business may also be affected by actions of domestic and foreign governments to restrict the activities of direct selling companies for various reasons, including a limitation on the ability of direct selling companies to operate without the\ninvolvement of a traditional retail channel. Foreign governments may also introduce other forms of protectionist legislation, such as limitations or requirements on where the products can or must be produced or requirements that non-domestic companies doing or seeking to do business place a certain percentage of ownership of legal entities in the hands of local nationals to protect the commercial interests of its citizens. Customs laws, tariffs, import duties, export and import quotas, and restrictions on repatriation of foreign earnings and/or other methods of accessing cash generated internationally, may negatively affect the Company\u2019s local or corporate operations. Governments may seek either to impose taxes on independent sales force members, to classify independent sales force members as employees of direct selling companies with whom they may be associated, triggering employment-related taxes on the Company\u2019s sales force and/or the direct selling companies, or to impose registration requirements that could impact prospects\u2019 willingness to join the sales force. Some governments prohibit or impose limitations on the requirement to purchase demonstration products upon joining a direct selling business and/or the types of activities for which sales force can be compensated. The United States government may impose restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to engage in business in other countries in connection with the foreign policy of the United States.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur financial results and ability to grow our business may be negatively impacted by global events beyond our control.\nThese types of events could disrupt business and otherwise materially adversely affect business and financial condition. With operations in many states and multiple foreign countries, the Company is subject to numerous risks outside of its control, including risks arising from natural disasters, such as fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, unusual weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks and other global health emergencies, terrorist acts or disruptive global political events, or similar disruptions that could materially adversely affect business and financial performance.\nAny public health emergencies, including a real or potential global pandemic such as those caused by the avian flu, SARS, Ebola, coronavirus, or even a particularly virulent flu, could decrease demand for the Company\u2019s products and ability to offer them through parties held by the sales force. The worldwide outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (\"COVID-19\"), which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a \"pandemic,\" has impacted worldwide economic activity. The Company\u2019s employees, contractors, suppliers, sales force, consumers, and other business partners have been forced to conduct more limited business activities for an extended period of time, including due to required shutdowns requested or mandated by governmental authorities. The Company\u2019s top priority is to protect its employees and their families, the sales force and consumers, and its operations from any adverse impacts. The Company has taken precautionary measures as directed by health authorities and local governments. COVID-19 has and may continue to have an impact on ports and trade into and out of countries around the world. Given the interconnectivity of global supply chain and global economy, the impact of COVID-19 has been extensive. While COVID-19 has had a negative impact on some of the Company\u2019s suppliers and customers, the Company believes it has also experienced a positive impact from COVID-19 on overall net sales (as many customers are working from home). We are unable to predict the impact on the Company\u2019s business when quarantining and other stay-at-home restrictions are lifted due to COVID-19, and the Company\u2019s business may be materially adversely affected upon cessation of restrictions related to COVID-19.\nUncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect travel and the ability of businesses to remain open, which could lead to decreased ability for sales force to connect with customers and materially adversely affect short-term results of operations. Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, business and financial condition.\nOur success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, and our continued ability to attract and retain highly talented new team members.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of qualified personnel at all levels, including its senior management team and other key employees. Their motivation, skills, experience, contacts, and industry knowledge significantly benefit the Company\u2019s operations and administration. The failure to attract, motivate, and retain members of the senior management team could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. During 2020, the composition of the Company\u2019s senior management changed substantially. Any significant leadership change or senior management transition involves inherent risk and any failure to ensure a smooth transition could hinder the Company\u2019s strategic planning, execution, and future performance. A change in the senior management team may create uncertainty among investors, employees, and others concerning the Company\u2019s future direction and performance. Any disruption in the Company\u2019s operations or uncertainty could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for raw materials and the loss of these suppliers, a supplier\u2019s inability to supply a raw material or a disruption or interruption in the supply chain may adversely affect our business.\nThe supply and cost of raw materials, particularly petroleum and natural gas-based resins, may have an impact on the availability or cost of the Company\u2019s plastic products. We may experience a significant disruption in the supply of raw materials from current\nsources or, in the event of a disruption, we may be unable to locate alternative materials suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. Moreover, our suppliers may not be able to fill our orders in a timely manner depending on market conditions or increased demand for product. In addition, if we lose or need to replace an existing supplier as a result of adverse economic conditions or other reasons, additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or suppliers or manufacturers may not be able to allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. Even if we are able to expand existing sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers on our methods, products and quality control standards. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of raw materials could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet consumer demand for our products and result in lower net revenues and net income (or higher net loss) both in the short and long term.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property rights, or our conflict with the rights of others, could damage our brand, weaken our competitive position and negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur success depends in large part on our brand image. We currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent and unfair competition laws, confidentiality procedures, and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. The steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. In addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some jurisdictions.\nPreventing unauthorized use or infringement of our intellectual property rights is inherently difficult. The Company\u2019s products are subject to frequent counterfeiting and other intellectual property infringement, which may be difficult to police and prevent, depending upon the ability to identify infringers and the availability and/or enforceability of intellectual property rights. Such counterfeit sales, to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales, could adversely affect our operating results. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, we may be at a disadvantage to others who do not incur the substantial time and expense we incur to create our products. Any of these events could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur stock price may be volatile, and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.\nThe Company can also experience volatility in its common stock due to various factors, including negative investor sentiment and other factors beyond our control. These factors may include, among others, overall performance of the equity markets, variations in our quarterly results of operations or those of our competitors, our ability to meet our published guidance and securities analyst expectations, or recommendations by securities analysts. Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, regulatory, and market conditions, may also impact the market price of our common stock. Other risks, as discussed in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this Report,\" can be relevant to performance as well. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock.", "PERMNO": 83462, "SIC": 3089, "TIC": "TUP"}
