{"cik": "16732", "company": "CAMPBELL SOUP CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-09-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition.\nOperational Risk Factors\nWe face significant competition in all our product categories, which may result in lower sales and margins\nWe operate in the highly competitive food and beverage industry mainly in the North American market and experience competition in all of our categories. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, nutritional value, price, promotion, innovation, shelf space and customer service. A number of our primary competitors are larger than us and have substantial financial, marketing and other resources, and some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities than we do. In addition, reduced barriers to entry and easier access to funding are creating new competition. A strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a continued shift towards private label offerings, could result in us reducing prices, increasing marketing or other expenditures, and/or losing market share, each of which may result in lower sales and margins.\nOur ability to compete also depends upon our ability to predict, identify, and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to those preferences. There are inherent marketplace risks associated with new product or packaging introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance. If we do not succeed in offering products that consumers want to buy, our sales and market share will decrease, resulting in reduced profitability. If we are unable to accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be long-lasting, or are unable to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences, our sales will decline. In addition, given the variety of backgrounds and identities of consumers in our consumer base, we must offer a sufficient array of products to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences. As such, we must be successful in developing innovative products across a multitude of product categories. Finally, if we fail to rapidly develop products in faster-growing and more profitable categories, we could experience reduced demand for our products, or fail to expand margins.\nOur results may be adversely affected by our inability to complete or realize the projected benefits of divestitures\nDuring the first half of 2020, we expect to complete the sale of our Arnott\u2019s and international operations and use the net proceeds from this divestiture to reduce debt. Our ability to successfully divest this business depends upon, among other things, receiving all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected. In addition, any other businesses we decide to divest may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers, negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected. Potential risks of divestitures may also include diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, loss of key suppliers and/or customers of divested businesses, the inability to separate divested businesses or business units effectively and efficiently from our existing business operations and the inability to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs. If we are unable to complete or realize the projected benefits of planned and/or future divestitures, we may not be able to reduce our debt as planned and our business or financial results may be adversely impacted.\nWe may be adversely impacted by our substantial indebtedness\nWe used the net proceeds from the businesses we sold in 2019 to reduce our debt and expect to use the net proceeds from the sale of Campbell International to further reduce debt. However, as of July 28, 2019, we maintained approximately $8.7 billion of indebtedness, and this level of indebtedness may have important consequences to our business, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nincreasing the possibility of a downgrade in our credit rating;\n\u2022\nincreasing our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates;\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to new financial and other covenants;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, including undertaking significant capital projects;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged; and\n\u2022\nrestricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities, including other acquisitions.\nIn addition, we regularly access the commercial paper markets for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes. If our credit ratings are downgraded, we may have difficulty selling additional debt securities or borrowing money in the amounts and on the terms that might be available if our credit ratings were maintained. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information regarding our indebtedness.\nDisruptions in the commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the credit markets may also reduce the amount of commercial paper that we can issue and raise our borrowing costs for both short- and long-term debt offerings. There can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms we find acceptable. Limitations on our ability to access the capital markets, a reduction in our liquidity or an increase in our borrowing costs may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe may not achieve our targeted cost savings, which may adversely affect our ability to grow margins\nWe are pursuing multi-year cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of $850 million for continuing operations by the end of 2022, which includes $295 million in synergies and run-rate cost savings from our acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. These initiatives require a substantial amount of management and operational resources. Our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of these initiatives, including the integration of Snyder's-Lance in an efficient and effective manner. In some respects, our plans to achieve these cost savings continue to be refined. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives\" for additional information on these initiatives. These and related demands on our resources may divert the organization's attention from other business issues, have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale. Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, these often complex initiatives. Any failure to implement our initiatives could adversely affect our ability to grow margins.\nWe may not be able to increase prices to fully offset increases in the cost of transportation and logistics and prices of raw and packaging materials\nThe cost of distribution has increased recently due to a rise in transportation and logistics costs, driven by excess demand, reduced availability and higher fuel costs. In addition, certain of the materials required for the manufacture of our products, including steel, have been or may be impacted by tariffs.\nAs a manufacturer of food and beverage products, the raw and packaging materials used in our business include tomato paste, grains, beef, poultry, dairy, potatoes and other vegetables, steel, glass, paper and resin. Many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in crop size, cattle cycles, crop disease, crop pests, product scarcity, demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, government-sponsored agricultural programs and other government policy, import and export requirements (including tariffs), drought and excessive rain, temperature extremes and other adverse weather events, water scarcity, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, scarcity of organic ingredients and other factors that may be beyond our control. We may not be able to offset any price increases through productivity or price increases or through our commodity hedging activity.\nWe try to pass along to customers some or all cost increases through increases in the selling prices of, or decreases in the packaging sizes of, some of our products. Higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume. To the extent that price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset these increased costs, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of our customers\nOur businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade, which has experienced slower growth than other retail channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and e-commerce retailers. We expect this trend away from traditional retail grocery to alternate channels to continue in the future. These alternative retail channels may also create consumer price deflation, affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases. In addition, retailers with increased buying power and negotiating strength are seeking more favorable terms, including increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers. These customers may also use more of their shelf space for their private label products, which are generally sold at lower prices than branded products. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics, our business or financial results could be adversely impacted.\nIn 2019, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 43% of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations, with the largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounting for approximately 20% of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations. In addition, The Kroger Co. and its affiliates accounted for approximately 9% of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations in 2019. There can be no assurance that our largest customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities, or on the same terms as in the past. Disruption of sales to any of these customers, or to any of our other large customers, for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nOur results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands\nWe have a number of iconic brands with significant value. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business. Brand value is primarily based on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, packaging or ingredients (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our results could be adversely impacted.\nDisruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our business\nOur ability to manufacture and/or sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing, warehousing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics service providers or independent distributors. This damage or disruption could result from execution issues, as well as factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as product or raw material scarcity, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, pandemics, strikes, cybersecurity breaches, government shutdowns, disruptions in logistics, supplier capacity constraints or other events. Production of the agricultural commodities used in our business may also be adversely affected by drought and excessive rain, temperature extremes and other adverse weather events, water scarcity, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, scarcity of organic ingredients, crop size, cattle cycles, crop disease and crop pests. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, may adversely affect our business or financial results, particularly in circumstances when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location. Disputes with significant suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics service providers or independent distributors, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products, as well as our business or financial results.\nIf our food products become adulterated or are mislabeled, we might need to recall those items, and we may experience product liability claims and damage to our reputation\nWe have in the past and we may, in the future, need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled, and we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes sickness or injury to consumers. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment. A significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety and/or quality of our products, ingredients or packaging. In addition, if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete, consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in that category.\nAn impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could adversely affect our financial results and net worth\nAs of July 28, 2019, we had goodwill of $4.678 billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $2.753 billion, of which a total of $785 million relates to Campbell International and has been included in Noncurrent assets of discontinued operations. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the unit's fair value. Similarly, we test indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values. Fair value for both goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. If the carrying values of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed their fair value, the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered impaired and reduced to fair value. Factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, future economic and market conditions or assumed royalty rates. We have, in the most recently completed and prior years, experienced impairment charges. See \"Significant Accounting Estimates\" and Notes 3 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on recent impairments. We may be required in the future to record additional impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets, which could adversely affect our financial results and net worth.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands\nWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret protection, contractual agreements and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect\nour intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nCompeting intellectual property claims that impact our brands or products may arise unexpectedly. Any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and time-consuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, launch and sale of certain products. Any of these occurrences may harm our business and financial results.\nWe may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to our defined benefit pension plans\nWe sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for certain employees in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. locations. The major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets, investment returns, interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe may be adversely impacted by a failure or security breach of our information technology systems\nOur information technology systems are critically important to our operations. We rely on our information technology systems (some of which are outsourced to third parties) to manage our data, communications and business processes, including our marketing, sales, manufacturing, procurement, logistics, customer service, accounting and administrative functions. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain and protect appropriate information technology systems, our business or financial results could be adversely impacted. Furthermore, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to attack or other security breaches (including the access to or acquisition of customer, consumer or other confidential information), service disruptions or other system failures. If we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve these breaches, disruptions or failures, our operations may be impacted, and we may suffer other adverse consequences such as reputational damage, litigation, remediation costs and/or penalties under various data protection laws and regulations.\nTo address the risks to our information technology systems and the associated costs, we maintain an information security program that includes updating technology and security policies, cyber insurance, employee training, and monitoring and routine testing of our information technology systems. We believe that these preventative actions provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and generally reduce our cybersecurity risks. Although we have not experienced a material incident to date, there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident. The cost to remediate damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyber attack could be significant.\nIn addition, in the event our suppliers or customers experience a breach or system failure, their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which may result in a disruption in our supply chain or reduced customer orders, which would adversely affect our business and financial results. We have also outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions to third-party service providers, and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. If these service providers do not perform effectively due to breach or system failure, we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits and our business may be disrupted.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business\nWe depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified individuals. We also compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, train and retain other talented personnel. Any such loss or failure may adversely affect our business or financial results. In addition, activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense. We may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave, or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms, each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results. We also recently streamlined our business into a two-division operating model, which could lead to operational challenges and higher employee turnover.\nOur results may be adversely affected by our inability to complete or realize the projected benefits of acquisitions and other strategic transactions\nWe may undertake additional acquisitions or other strategic transactions. Our ability to meet our objectives with respect to acquisitions and other strategic transactions may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable counterparties, negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms, obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected and complete those transactions. Potential risks also include:\n\u2022\nthe inability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations in a timely and cost-efficient manner;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees, suppliers and/or customers of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nassumption of unknown risks and liabilities;\n\u2022\nthe inability to achieve anticipated benefits, including revenues or other operating results;\n\u2022\noperating costs of acquired businesses may be greater than expected;\n\u2022\nthe inability to promptly implement an effective control environment; and\n\u2022\nthe risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which we have limited or no prior experience.\nMarket Conditions and Other General Risk Factors\nActions of activist shareholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business\nWe were the target of activist shareholder activities in 2019. If these activities continue, our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist shareholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, customers, employees, suppliers and other strategic partners, and cause our share price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation.\nWe face risks related to recession, financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions\nCustomer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions, recession, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. Similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. In addition, changes in tax or interest rates in the U.S. or other nations, whether due to recession, economic disruptions or other reasons, may adversely impact us.\nThe administering regulatory authority announced it intends to phase out London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) by the end of 2021. Our variable rate debt and revolving credit facility use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing interest rates. While we expect to have paid off our variable-rate debt and replaced or renegotiated our revolving credit facility by the end of 2021, we plan to incur additional indebtedness and/or negotiate new terms that will rely on an alternative method to LIBOR. Any legal or regulatory changes made in response to LIBOR\u2019s future discontinuance may result in, among other things, a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in LIBOR, a delay in the publication of LIBOR, or changes in the rules or methodologies in LIBOR. In addition, alternative methods to LIBOR may be impossible or impracticable to determine. While we do not expect that the transition from LIBOR and risks related thereto will have a material adverse effect on our financing costs, it is still uncertain at this time.\nLegal and Regulatory Risk Factors\nWe may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory proceedings or claims\nWe are a party to a variety of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding reportable legal proceedings. Since these actions are inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such proceedings or claims, or that our assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection with such matters, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such proceedings or claims. In particular, the marketing of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal, state and foreign laws or regulations. Additionally, the independent contractor distribution model, which is used by Pepperidge Farm and Snyder\u2019s-Lance, has also come under increased regulatory scrutiny. Our independent contractor distribution model has also been the subject of various class and individual lawsuits in recent years. In the event we are unable to successfully defend ourselves against these proceedings or claims, or if our assessment of the materiality of these proceedings or claims proves inaccurate, our business or financial results may be adversely affected. In addition, our reputation could be damaged by allegations made in proceedings or claims (even if untrue).\nIncreased regulation or changes in law could adversely affect our business or financial results\nThe manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated. Various laws and regulations govern the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, marketing, advertising, labeling, quality and safety of our food products, as well as the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment. In the U.S., we are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies, including but not limited to the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. We are also regulated by similar agencies outside the U.S.\nGovernmental and administrative bodies within the U.S. are considering a variety of tax, trade and other regulatory reforms. Trade reforms include tariffs on certain materials used in the manufacture of our products and tariffs on certain finished products. Changes in legal or regulatory requirements (such as new food safety requirements and revised regulatory requirements for the labeling of nutrition facts, serving sizes and genetically modified ingredients), or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance cost, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business and financial results.", "PERMNO": 25320, "SIC": 2030, "TIC": "CPB"}
