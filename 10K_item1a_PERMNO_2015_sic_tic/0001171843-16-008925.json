{"cik": "1626878", "company": "XBiotech Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred significant losses every quarter since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses in the future.\nWe are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company with no revenue and a limited operating history. Investment in pharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate efficacy or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval or become commercially viable. We do not have any products approved by regulatory authorities for marketing or commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales, or otherwise, to date, and we continue to incur significant research, development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred losses in every reporting period since our inception in 2005. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014, and 2015, we reported a net loss of $9.9 million, $21.7 million, and $37.1 million respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit since inception of $130.3 million.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate these losses will increase as we continue the research and development of, and seek regulatory approvals for Xilonix\u2122 and any of our other product candidates, and potentially begin to commercialize any products that may achieve regulatory approval. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our financial condition. The amount of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenues. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our financial condition. If Xilonix\u2122 or any other product candidate fails in clinical trials or does not gain regulatory approval, or if approved and fails to achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. We will need to raise significant additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts or other operations.\nSince inception, we have dedicated a majority of our resources to the discovery and development of our proprietary preclinical and clinical product candidates, and we expect to continue to expend substantial resources doing so for the foreseeable future. These expenditures will include costs associated with conducting research and development, manufacturing product candidates and products approved for sale, conducting preclinical experiments and clinical trials and obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals, as well as commercializing any products later approved for sale. During the year ending December 31, 2015, we recognized approximately $31.3 million in expenses associated with research and development and clinical trials.\nWe completed our initial public offering on April 15, 2015. However, the net proceeds from the offering and cash on hand may not be sufficient to complete clinical development of any of our product candidates nor may it be sufficient to commercialize any product candidate. Accordingly, we may require substantial additional capital beyond the offering to continue our clinical development and potential commercialization activities. Our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022 the number and characteristics of the future product candidates we pursue;\n\u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing any of our future product candidates, and conducting preclinical research and clinical trials;\n\u2022 the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for any future product candidates we develop;\n\u2022 the cost of future commercialization activities for Xilonix\u2122 and the cost of commercializing any future products approved for sale;\n\u2022 the cost of manufacturing our future products; and\n\u2022 the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patents, including litigation costs and the outcome of any such litigation.\nWe are unable to estimate the funds we will actually require to complete research and development of our product candidates or the funds required to commercialize any resulting product in the future or the funds that will be required to meet other expenses. Our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and our expenses may be higher than expected. We may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches. Raising funds in the future may present additional challenges and future financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing shareholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nThe terms of any financing arrangements we enter into may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our shareholders and the issuance of additional securities, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. The sale of additional equity or convertible securities would dilute all of our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and, potentially, the imposition of restrictive covenants. Those covenants may include limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. We could also be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or otherwise at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable resulting in the loss of rights to some of our product candidates or other unfavorable terms, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. Additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our products.\nWe are subject to two related shareholder class action lawsuits, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe and certain of our executive officers and directors are defendants in a federal securities class action lawsuit and in a similar securities class action filed in state court in California. These lawsuits, including their current status, are described in Part I, Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in this Form 10-K. While we believe these lawsuits to be without merit and intend to vigorously defend them, we are in the early stages of both cases and we cannot guarantee any particular outcome. These and any similar future matters may divert our attention from our ordinary business operations, and we may incur significant expenses associated with them (including, without limitation, substantial attorneys\u2019 fees and other fees of professional advisors and potential obligations to indemnify the underwriter for our initial public offering and current and former officers and directors who are or may become parties to or involved in such matters). Depending on the outcome of such matters, we could be required to pay material damages and/or suffer other penalties, remedies or sanctions. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of these pending matters or any similar future matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to meet our debt obligations and could negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. Any existing or future shareholder lawsuits could also adversely impact our reputation, our relationships with our customers and our ability to generate revenue.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe currently have no source of product revenue and may never become profitable.\nTo date, we have not generated any revenues from commercial product sales, or otherwise. Our ability to generate revenue in the future from product sales and achieve profitability will depend upon our ability, alone or with any future collaborators, to commercialize products successfully, including Xilonix\u2122 or any future product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire in the future. Even if we are able to achieve regulatory approval successfully for Xilonix\u2122 or any future product candidates, we do not know when any of these products will generate revenue from product sales, if at all. Our ability to generate revenue from product sales from Xilonix\u2122 or any of our other product candidates also depends on a number of additional factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022 complete development activities, including the necessary clinical trials;\n\u2022 complete and submit new drug applications, or NDAs, to the US Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and obtain regulatory approval for indications for which there is a commercial market;\n\u2022 complete and submit applications to, and obtain regulatory approval from, foreign regulatory authorities such as the European Medicines Agency, or EMA;\n\u2022 establish our manufacturing operations;\n\u2022 develop a commercial organization capable of sales, marketing and distribution for Xilonix\u2122 and any products for which we obtain marketing approval and intend to sell ourselves in the markets in which we choose to commercialize on our own;\n\u2022 find suitable distribution partners to help us market, sell and distribute our approved products in other markets;\n\u2022 obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government and private payors;\n\u2022 achieve market acceptance for our products, if any;\n\u2022 establish, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022 attract, hire and retain qualified personnel.\nIn addition, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, including that Xilonix\u2122 or any other product candidates may not advance through development or achieve the endpoints of applicable clinical trials, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. In addition, our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we decide to or are required by the FDA, or foreign regulatory authorities, to perform studies or trials in addition to those that we currently anticipate. Even if we are able to complete the development and regulatory process for Xilonix\u2122 or any other product candidates, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing these products.\nEven if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of Xilonix\u2122 or any other product candidates that may be approved, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.\nOur future success is dependent on the regulatory approval and commercialization of Xilonix\u2122 and any of our other product candidates.\nWe do not have any products that have gained regulatory approval. Our lead product, Xilonix\u2122, is currently in a Phase III clinical trial in the United States and completed a Phase III clinical trial during Q4 2015 in Europe, respectively. As a result, our near-term prospects, including our ability to finance our operations and generate revenue, are substantially dependent on our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and, if approved, to successfully commercialize Xilonix\u2122 in a timely manner. We cannot commercialize Xilonix\u2122 or our other product candidates in the United States without first obtaining regulatory approval for each product from the FDA; similarly, we cannot commercialize Xilonix\u2122 or our other product candidates outside of the United States without obtaining regulatory approval from comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the EMA. The FDA review process typically takes years to complete and approval is never guaranteed. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any Xilonix\u2122 or any of our other potential product candidates for a target indication, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in preclinical and well-controlled clinical studies, generally including two well-controlled Phase III trials, and, with respect to approval in the United States, to the satisfaction of the FDA, that the product candidate is safe and effective for use for that target indication and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate. Obtaining regulatory approval for marketing of Xilonix\u2122 or our future product candidates in one country does not ensure we will be able to obtain regulatory approval in other countries. A failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in other countries.\nEven if Xilonix\u2122 or any of our other product candidates were to successfully obtain approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, any approval might contain significant limitations related to use restrictions for specified age groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications, or may be subject to burdensome post-approval study or risk management requirements. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for Xilonix\u2122 in one or more jurisdictions, or any approval contains significant limitations, we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding or generate sufficient revenue to continue the development of any of our other product candidates that we are developing or may discover, in-license, develop or acquire in the future. Also, any regulatory approval of any of Xilonix\u2122 or our other product candidates, once obtained, may be withdrawn. Furthermore, even if we obtain regulatory approval for Xilonix\u2122, the commercial success of Xilonix\u2122 will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022 development of a commercial organization or establishment of a commercial collaboration with a commercial infrastructure;\n\u2022 establishment of commercially viable pricing and obtaining approval for adequate reimbursement from third-party and government payors;\n\u2022 our ability to manufacture quantities of Xilonix\u2122 using commercially sufficient processes and at a scale sufficient to meet anticipated demand and enable us to reduce our cost of manufacturing;\n\u2022 our success in educating physicians and patients about the benefits, administration and use of Xilonix\u2122;\n\u2022 the availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of alternative and competing treatments;\n\u2022 the effectiveness of our own or our potential strategic collaborators\u2019 marketing, sales and distribution strategy and operations;\n\u2022 acceptance of Xilonix\u2122 as safe and effective by patients and the medical community; and\n\u2022 a continued acceptable safety profile of Xilonix\u2122 following approval.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. If we are unable to successfully commercialize Xilonix\u2122, we may not be able to earn sufficient revenues to continue our business.\nWe recently submitted a Marketing Authorization Application the EMA for XilonixTM after successfully completing a Phase III clinical trial in Europe. Even if the EMA approves XilonixTM there are a number of obstacles to consider in the post-marketing approval and commercialization processes in Europe.\nOn March 7, 2016, we submitted our Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, to the EMA Center for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, for the Phase III clinical trial of XilonixTM completed in Europe during Q4 2015. The regulatory assessment process at the EMA is both long and expensive and may not lead to a subsequent approval. In the initial MAA submission to the EMA, the regulatory body must validate the application prior to its official assessment. As of March 14, 2016 we are currently undergoing the content validation stage of the submission. The EMA can return with questions about the content and require specific updates or changes. This can delay our timeline or result in halting of our application process before reaching the assessment phase.\nWe have been approved for review under the Centralised Procedure at the EMA, which generally means that it takes 210 days. However, we submitted a request to the EMA to be reviewed under the Accelerated Assessment procedure, which has a general duration of 150 days. We may not be approved for the Accelerated Assessment procedure, which can delay the timeline of learning of the EMA decision on the overall assessment of our application. Furthermore, the EMA has the ability to \u201cstop the clock\u201d of the assessment timeline if there are any questions about the application that arise. We are given a specific amount of time to respond to such questions, and must do so to the satisfaction of the EMA before the clock resumes. This can cause further delays and overall uncertainty as to when we receive an official decision as to whether or not our application is approved.\nDuring the assessment period, our manufacturing facilities will most likely be audited. They must meet the standards of Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP. If the GMP inspectors assigned to auditing the manufacturing facilities finds any violations we may experience potential challenges in the overall approval and assessment process, and potentially, the ability to commercially manufacture XilonixTM. Additionally, our new manufacturing facility is scheduled to go through validation with the EMA. The new facility might fail validation or not meet EMA standards for a commercial manufacturing facility. Also, during the assessment period, our clinical research sites engaged to recruit patients into the clinical trial, will most likely be audited to ensure standards of Good Clinical Practice, or GCP. The EMA could have findings showing that our clinical research sites, or other aspects of the trial failed to meet GCP standards potentially impacting or delaying approval.\nThere are a few possibilities surrounding the regulatory approval status of XilonixTM at the EMA: 1) The EMA may not approve XilonixTM due to our failure to prove our endpoints to the satisfaction of the CHMP committee members, who may be different individuals or share a different thinking from the Scientific Advice Working Group at the EMA whom we worked with to design the trial, thus there may be a general lack of buy-in from the reviewing committee, or other unforeseeable disagreement with the study design; 2) The EMA may approve XilonixTM , but with caveats such as conducting follow up clinical trials to show further safety data or additional data for endpoints established in the study protocol. Conducting additional studies would be expensive and time consuming, and present further roadblocks to full approval and commercialization, thus preventing us from generating revenue for the company; or 3) The EMA may approve XilonixTM. If the EMA approves XilonixTM there are additional steps we must take for full marketing and commercialization of the product. EMA approval does not guarantee country specific reimbursement across the EU. We still must pursue review of product for pricing and reimbursement, which requires additional time and cost. Even though the EMA may approve XilonixTM this does not necessarily guarantee certain EU countries will accept our product for reimbursement. We could face no acceptance for reimbursement in any country, or reimbursement in very few countries, thus minimizing our ability to generate sufficient revenue.\nIn addition to seeking approval in specific EU countries, we must also gain reimbursement approval, as well as buy-in from patients and health care professionals alike for the use of XilonixTM to treat advanced metastatic colorectal cancer. If we do not receive reimbursement from country or private payers in the EU, XilonixTM may not reach or be accessible to patients or health care professionals. Even if XilonixTM is approved for reimbursement in EU countries, it may not always maintain its reimbursement status. Some countries may decide to no longer reimburse XilonixTM for unforeseeable reasons. Further, patients and health care professionals may reject XilonixTM as a reasonable standard of care treatment for advanced metastatic colorectal cancer. If patients and healthcare professionals reject XilonixTM as a treatment for advanced metastatic colorectal cancer, then it will be difficult to generate revenue for the company.\nIf XilonixTM is approved by the EMA, we do not have the appropriate personnel engaged as employees to conduct an effective marketing and commercialization strategy. As a result, we must pursue a strategic partnership through a contractual arrangement with an organization with the appropriate expertise. The cost-benefit of such an arrangement may not actualize profit and generate revenues on a short-term basis. Because we would entrust commercialization to an outside organization, there may be any number of issues that arise that we cannot foresee.\nBecause the results of earlier clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, Xilonix\u2122, which is currently in an on-going Phase III clinical trial as well as a recently completed Phase III clinical trial, or any other product candidate we advance into clinical trials, may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive regulatory approval.\nSuccess in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical trials. Despite the results reported in earlier clinical trials for Xilonix\u2122, we do not know whether the clinical trials we are conducting, or may conduct, will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market Xilonix\u2122 or any of our other product candidates in any particular jurisdiction. Even if we believe that we have adequate data to support an application for regulatory approval to market our product candidates, the FDA or other applicable foreign regulatory authorities may not agree and may require us to conduct additional clinical trials. If later-stage clinical trials do not produce favorable results, our ability to achieve regulatory approval for any of our product candidates may be adversely impacted.\nIf we are unable to enroll subjects in clinical trials, we will be unable to complete these trials on a timely basis.\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of subjects to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, ability to obtain and maintain patient consents, risk that enrolled subjects will drop out before completion, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. Furthermore, we rely on Clinical Research Organizations (\u201cCRO\u2019s\u201d) and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials, and while we have agreements governing their committed activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance. We may experience delays in enrolling subjects in our trials and may not be able to enroll sufficient subjects to complete the trials.\nIf we experience delays in the completion or termination of, any clinical trial of Xilonix\u2122 or any future product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales, which would impair our ability to generate revenues and may harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and future prospects. In addition, many of the factors that could cause a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of Xilonix\u2122 or our other product candidates.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for Xilonix\u2122 or our other product candidates, our business may fail.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities is unpredictable, but typically takes many years following the commencement of preclinical studies and clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate, and it is possible that neither Xilonix\u2122 nor any other product candidates we are developing or may discover, in-license or acquire and seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nOur product candidates could fail to receive marketing approval from the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority for many reasons, including:\n\u2022 disagreement over the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022 failure to demonstrate that a product candidate is safe;\n\u2022 failure of clinical trials to meet the level of statistical significance required for approval;\n\u2022 failure to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022 disagreement over our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022 disagreement over whether to accept efficacy results from clinical trial sites outside the United States where the standard of care is potentially different from that in the United States;\n\u2022 the insufficiency of data collected from clinical trials of Xilonix\u2122 or our other product candidates to support the submission and filing of an NDA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval;\n\u2022 irreparable or critical compliance issues relating to our manufacturing process; or\n\u2022 changes in the approval policies or regulations that render our preclinical and clinical data insufficient for approval.\nThe FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may require more information, including additional preclinical or clinical data to support approval, which may delay or prevent approval and our commercialization plans, or we may decide to abandon the development program altogether. Even if we do obtain regulatory approval, Xilonix\u2122 or our other product candidates may be approved for fewer or more limited indications than we request, approved contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or approved with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. In addition, if Xilonix\u2122 or our other product candidate produces undesirable side effects or safety issues, the FDA may require the establishment of Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may require the establishment of a similar strategy, that may, restrict distribution of our products and impose burdensome implementation requirements on us. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nEven if we believe our current or planned clinical trials are successful, the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may not agree that our completed clinical trials provide adequate data on the safety or efficacy of Xilonix\u2122 or our other product candidates to permit us to proceed to additional clinical trials. Approval by comparable foreign regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by the FDA and approval by one or more foreign regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or by the FDA. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and even if we file we may not receive the necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\nXilonix\u2122 or our other product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following any marketing approval.\nUndesirable side effects caused by Xilonix\u2122 or our other product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authority. If toxicities occur in our current or future clinical trials they could cause delay or even discontinuance of further development of Xilonix\u2122 or other product candidates, which would impair our ability to generate revenues and would have a material adverse effect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and future prospects. To date the majority of adverse events observed in clinical trials of Xilonix\u2122 have been mild and have not resulted in discontinuation of therapy. There have been no serious side effects observed that appear to be related to administration of Xilonix\u2122 in our clinical trials. There can be no assurance that side effects from Xilonix\u2122 in future clinical trials will continue to be mild or that side effects in general will not prompt the discontinued development of Xilonix\u2122 or other product candidates. If serious side effects or other safety or toxicity issues are experienced in our clinical trials in the future, we may not receive approval to market Xilonix\u2122 or any other product candidates, which could prevent us from ever generating revenues or achieving profitability. Results of our trials could reveal an unacceptably high severity and prevalence of side effects. In such an event, our trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled subjects to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and future prospects.\nAdditionally, if Xilonix\u2122 or any of our other product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such product, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022 we may be forced to suspend marketing of such product;\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may withdraw their approvals of such product;\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label that could diminish the usage or otherwise limit the commercial success of such product;\n\u2022 the FDA or other regulatory bodies may issue safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings about such product;\n\u2022 the FDA may require the establishment or modification of REMS or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may require the establishment or modification of a similar strategy that may, for instance, restrict distribution of our product and impose burdensome implementation requirements on us;\n\u2022 we may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u2022 we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to subjects or patients;\n\u2022 we may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n\u2022 our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved.\nEven if Xilonix\u2122 or our other product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for Xilonix\u2122 or another product candidate, it would be subject to ongoing requirements by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities governing the manufacture, quality control, further development, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, import, export, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. The safety profile of any product will continue to be closely monitored by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities after approval. If the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities become aware of new safety information after approval of Xilonix\u2122 or any other product candidate, they may require labeling changes or establishment of a REMS or similar strategy, impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance. For example, the label ultimately approved for Xilonix\u2122, if it achieves marketing approval, may include restrictions on use.\nIn addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and other regulations. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, our manufacturing facility, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. If we, our product candidates or our manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022 issue warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022 impose restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product candidates;\n\u2022 mandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners;\n\u2022 require us or any future collaborator to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022 seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u2022 suspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022 suspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022 refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us;\n\u2022 suspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022 seize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize Xilonix\u2122 or any other product candidates and generate revenue.\nThe FDA strictly regulates the advertising and promotion of drug products, and drug products may only be marketed or promoted for their FDA approved uses, consistent with the product\u2019s approved labeling. Advertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval in the United States will be heavily scrutinized by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, state attorneys general, members of Congress and the public. Violations, including promotion of our products for unapproved or off-label uses, are subject to enforcement letters, inquiries and investigations, and civil, criminal and/or administrative sanctions by the FDA and/or the DOJ. Additionally, advertising and promotion of, any product candidate that obtains approval outside of the United States will be heavily scrutinized by comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nIn the United States, engaging in impermissible promotion of our future products for off-label uses can also subject us to false claims litigation under federal and state statutes, which can lead to civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties and fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which we promote or distribute our drug products. These false claims statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which allows any individual to bring a lawsuit against a pharmaceutical company on behalf of the federal government alleging submission of false or fraudulent claims, or causing to present such false or fraudulent claims, for payment by a federal program such as Medicare or Medicaid. If the government prevails in the lawsuit, the individual may share in any fines or settlement funds. Since 2004, these False Claims Act lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies have increased significantly in volume and breadth, leading to several substantial civil and criminal settlements based on certain sales practices promoting off-label drug uses. This growth in litigation has increased the risk that a pharmaceutical company will have to defend a false claim action, pay settlement fines or restitution, agree to comply with burdensome reporting and compliance obligations, and be excluded from the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. If we do not lawfully promote our approved products, we may become subject to such litigation and, if we are not successful in defending against such actions, those actions could have a material adverse effect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and future prospects.\nExisting government regulations may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of Xilonix\u2122 or any other product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and/or be subject to fines or enhanced government oversight and reporting obligations, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent Xilonix\u2122 or any other product candidates from being marketed in those jurisdictions.\nIn order to market and sell our products in the European Union and many other jurisdictions, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be effectively commercialized in that country.. Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. A failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. If we are unable to obtain approval of Xilonix\u2122 for any of our other product candidates by regulatory authorities in the European Union or another jurisdiction, the commercial prospects of that product candidate may be significantly diminished and our business prospects could decline.\nEven if we are able to commercialize Xilonix\u2122 or our other product candidates, the products may not receive coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which could harm our business.\nOur ability to commercialize any products successfully will depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government authorities, private health insurers, health maintenance organizations and third-party payors. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Coverage and adequate reimbursement from government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private health insurers are critical to new product acceptance. Patients are unlikely to use Xilonix\u2122 or our other product candidates unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our product candidates. A primary trend in the US healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. As a result, government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Third-party payors may also seek additional clinical evidence, beyond the data required to obtain marketing approval, demonstrating clinical benefits and value in specific patient populations before covering our products for those patients. We cannot be sure that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or are available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, obtaining coverage does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sales and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may only be temporary. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used. Reimbursement rates may also be based in part on existing reimbursement amounts for lower cost drugs or may be bundled into the payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage and reimbursement determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained or applied consistently. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nWe have never marketed a drug before, and if we are unable to establish an effective sales force and marketing infrastructure, or enter into acceptable third-party sales and marketing or licensing arrangements, we may be unable to generate any revenue.\nWe do not currently have an infrastructure for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical drug products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an infrastructure may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so. In order to market any products that may be approved by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services for which we would incur substantial costs. If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable. We will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded sales and marketing operations. Without an internal commercial organization or the support of a third party to perform sales and marketing functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nXilonix\u2122 and our other product candidates, if approved, may not achieve adequate market acceptance among physicians, patients, and healthcare payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for Xilonix\u2122 or any of our other product candidates, such product(s) may not gain market acceptance among physicians, healthcare payors, patients or the medical community. Our commercial success also depends on coverage and adequate reimbursement of our product candidates by third-party payors, including government payors, generally, which may be difficult or time-consuming to obtain, may be limited in scope and may not be obtained in all jurisdictions in which we may seek to market our products. Market acceptance of any of our product candidates for which we receive approval depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 the efficacy and safety of such product candidates as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u2022 the clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved;\n\u2022 acceptance by physicians and patients of the product candidate as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022 the potential and perceived advantages of product candidates over alternative treatments;\n\u2022 the safety of product candidates seen in a broader patient group, including a product candidate\u2019s use outside the approved indications;\n\u2022 the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022 product labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022 the timing of market introduction of our products as well as competitive products;\n\u2022 the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u2022 the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities;\n\u2022 relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022 the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and those of our collaborators; and\n\u2022 unfavorable publicity relating to the product candidate.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved but fail to achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, or healthcare payors, we will not be able to generate significant revenues, which would compromise our ability to become profitable.\nOur Research Programs May Not Succeed.\nAt this time we have a number of programs in pre-clinical as well as early to late stages of clinical development including:\n\u00b7 Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC)\n\u00b7 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)\n\u00b7 Atherosclerosis\n\u00b7 Pyoderma Gangrenosum\n\u00b7 Staphyloccocus Aureus\n\u00b7 Clostridium Difficile\n\u00b7 Ebola\nIn the past several months, XBiotech has positioned itself with a pipeline of potential drug candidates at a variety of stages, from development and pre-clinical through Phase III. Even though we have many drugs in development at this time, none of these research programs may succeed. There are several reasons why a drug program may fail:\n\u00b7 In the development stage, we may be unable to develop a therapy, which would mean us succeeding in isolating appropriate antibodies to reach the clinical trial stage\n\u00b7 Any partnerships for the development of antibodies could fail to produce results that would necessitate clinical trials\n\u00b7 We may not receive approval from regulatory bodies to move from early stage clinical trials to later stage clinical trials\n\u00b7 Even if we are able to move to later stage clinical trials, it may prove to be difficult to enroll patients into the studies according to schedule, or at all\n\u00b7 If a clinical trial is completed, we may not have the appropriate personnel to submit a marketing application to regulatory authorities for approval\n\u00b7 Regulatory authorities may reject drug candidates for a variety of reasons, preventing us to proceed with marketing and commercialization of approved products\n\u00b7 We may run out of funds necessary to complete development for any of our potential drug candidates\nEven an Effective Drug Candidate Might Not Be Commercially Successful.\nEven if we ultimately succeed in creating a safe and effective drug based on our current drug candidate pipeline, there is no assurance it would be commercially successful. Competitive products might become available faster or with lower costs or adverse risks to patients, resulting in few sales of any product developed by XBiotech. Occurrences of certain disease indications, such as those in our pipeline, might become sufficiently rare, or victims might be sufficiently impoverished, that commercial production is uneconomic. XBiotech\u2019s promises regarding donation of five percent of any gross revenues from an Ebola drug developed using the blood sample it received may adversely impact XBiotech and its shareholders. Furthermore, we must have sufficient buy-in from patients and healthcare professionals to guarantee market exposure for our drug candidates. If the end-users are not reached with our products, then it will be difficult to generate revenue from our development efforts. And even though we could obtain regulatory approval for any of our drug candidates, it is not necessarily the case that government or third-party payors will decide to add to their respective prescription drug formularies for reimbursement, thus inhibiting the ability for our drug candidates to reach the target patient populations, and health care professionals serving those patients.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current lead product candidate, Xilonix\u2122 for the treatment of colorectal cancer from Vectibix \u00ae by Amgen; Erbitux by Bristol Myers Squibb; Cyramza \u00ae by Eli Lilly and Company and Avastin by Genentech/Roche. Our competitors in the other therapeutic categories that we are addressing which are non-small cell lung cancer, restenosis in peripheral vascular disease, diabetes and psoriasis are Humira from AbbVie, Remicade and Stellara from J&J, Enbrel from Amgen and Necitmumab from Eli Lilly and Company. In the infectious disease area, there are no currently approved monoclonal antibody products, although many have been tried. The leading small-molecule antibiotics are Vancomycin, originally from Eli Lilly and Company now in a generic form from Baxter, Sandoz, Akorn and Hospira; Cubicin (Daptomycin) from Cubist and Dalvance from Durata.\nThere are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of the disease indications for which we are developing our future product candidates. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach, and others are based on entirely different approaches. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.\nMore established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their greater size, cash flows and institutional experience. Compared to us, many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources. As a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products before we do, which will limit our ability to develop or commercialize Xilonix\u2122 or any of our other product candidates. In addition, many companies are developing new therapeutics, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidates progress through clinical development.\nOur failure to successfully identify, acquire, develop and commercialize additional product candidates or approved products other than Xilonix\u2122 could impair our ability to grow.\nAlthough a substantial amount of our efforts will focus on the continued clinical testing and potential approval of our most advanced product candidate, Xilonix\u2122, a key element of our growth strategy is to acquire, develop and/or market additional products and product candidates. All of these potential product candidates remain in the discovery and clinical study stages. Research programs to identify product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources, whether or not any product candidates are ultimately identified. Because our internal research capabilities are limited, we may be dependent upon pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic scientists and other researchers to sell or license products or technology to us. The success of this strategy depends partly upon our ability to identify, select and acquire promising pharmaceutical product candidates and products. The process of proposing, negotiating and implementing a license or acquisition of a product candidate or approved product is lengthy and complex. Other companies, including some with substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources, may compete with us for the license or acquisition of product candidates and approved products. We have limited resources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third-party products, businesses and technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. Any product candidate that we acquire may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including extensive clinical testing and approval by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to risks of failure typical of pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that a product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that any products that we develop or approved products that we acquire will be manufactured profitably or achieve market acceptance.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of Xilonix\u2122 and any other product candidates in clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may develop. Product liability claims may be brought against us by subjects enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, healthcare providers or others using, administering or selling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022 decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u2022 termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u2022 injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022 withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022 significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022 substantial monetary awards to trial subjects or patients;\n\u2022 loss of revenue;\n\u2022 diversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations; and\n\u2022 the inability to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe intend to obtain insurance coverage for products to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for Xilonix\u2122 or our other product candidates, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.\nWe will need to expand our operations and grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of March 13, 2016, we had 84 employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, or as a result of any future acquisitions, we will need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, scientific, and financial headcount and other resources. Our management, personnel and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n\u2022 managing our clinical trials effectively, which we anticipate being conducted at numerous clinical sites;\n\u2022 identifying, recruiting, maintaining, motivating and integrating additional employees with the expertise and experience we will require;\n\u2022 managing our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, licensees, contractors and other third parties;\n\u2022 managing additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties;\n\u2022 improving our managerial, development, operational and finance reporting systems and procedures; and\n\u2022 expanding our facilities.\nOur failure to accomplish any of these tasks could prevent us from successfully growing our Company.\nWe are highly dependent on our Chief Executive Officer.\nOur future success depends in significant part on the continued service of our Chief Executive Officer, John Simard. Mr. Simard is critical to the strategic direction and overall management of our company as well as our research and development process. Although we have an employment agreement with Mr. Simard, it has no specific duration. The loss of Mr. Simard could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business, and many members of our current management team are new. If we are unable to retain, attract and integrate qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed.\nIn addition to the continued services of Mr. Simard, we believe that our future success is highly dependent on the contributions of our significant employees, as well as our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced sales, research and development and other personnel in the United States and abroad. Some of our significant employees, include our Medical Director, our Senior Vice President of Operations, our Vice President of Manufacturing, our Vice President of Quality, our Director of Research and Development, our Director of Quality Control and our Vice President of Finance and Human Resources. Changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business.\nAll of our employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, are free to terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, subject to any applicable notice requirements, and their knowledge of our business and industry may be difficult to replace. If one or more of our executive officers or significant employees leaves, we may not be able to fully integrate new personnel or replicate the prior working relationships, and our operations could suffer. Qualified individuals with the breadth of skills and experience in the pharmaceutical industry that we require are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. Many of the other pharmaceutical companies that we compete against for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense in the Austin area, where our headquarters are located. Our failure to retain key personnel could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the United States and elsewhere, including, as a result of our leased laboratory space, those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes.\nWe cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenues and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. We do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. We rely on third-parties to supply various items which are critical for producing our product candidates. Our ability to produce clinical supplies of product candidates could be disrupted, if the operations of these suppliers are affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption. The ultimate impact on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown, but our operations and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake, fire or other natural disaster. Further, any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows from future prospects.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality, licensing and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. Our commercial success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. Where we deem appropriate, we seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and have in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patents, including those patent rights licensed to us by third parties, are highly uncertain.\nThe steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, both inside and outside the United States. The rights already granted under any of our currently issued patents and those that may be granted under future issued patents may not provide us with the proprietary protection or competitive advantages we are seeking. If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficient, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or superior to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.\nWith respect to patent rights, we do not know whether any of existing patents or pending patent applications for any of our technologies or product candidates will result in the issuance of patents that protect such technologies or products candidates, or if any of our issued patents will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Our pending patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications. Further, the examination process may require us to narrow the claims for our pending patent applications, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained if these applications issue. Because the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, issued patents that we own or have licensed from third parties may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in the loss of patent protection, the narrowing of claims in such patents or the invalidity or unenforceability of such patents, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection for our technology and products. Protecting against the unauthorized use of our patented technology, trademarks and other intellectual property rights is expensive, difficult and, in some cases, may not be possible. In some cases, it may be difficult or impossible to detect third-party infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, even in relation to issued patent claims, and proving any such infringement may be even more difficult.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to any competitive advantage we may have.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022 Others may be able to make compounds that are the same as or similar to MABp1 or our future product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed.\n\u2022 We might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed.\n\u2022 We or any of our licensors or strategic partners might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions.\n\u2022 Others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights.\nIt is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents.\n\u2022 Issued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors.\n\u2022 Our competitors might conduct research and development activities in the United States and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets.\n\u2022 We may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\n\u2022 The patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur technology may be found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights.\nThird parties may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to their patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights in technology that is important to us. The asserted claims and/or litigation could include claims against us, our licensors or our suppliers alleging infringement of intellectual property rights with respect to our products or components of those products. Regardless of the merit of the claims, they could be time consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. We cannot assure you that licenses will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Furthermore, because of the potential for significant damage awards, which are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims resulting in large settlements. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nIf our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we may have to:\n\u2022 obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u2022 abandon an infringing drug or therapy candidate;\n\u2022 redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u2022 stop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others;\n\u2022 pay damages; or\n\u2022 defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.\nWe may need to license intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nA third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights, that are important or necessary to the development of our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of a third party to manufacture or otherwise commercialize our own technology or products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from such third party. Licensing such intellectual property may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside of the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nRisks Related to Owning Shares of our Common Stock\nOur share price may be volatile, which could subject us to securities class action litigation and prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the offering price.\nOur stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including:\n\u2022 results of our clinical trials;\n\u2022 results of clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022 regulatory actions with respect to our products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our competitors\u2019 operating results or changes in their growth rate;\n\u2022 competition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u2022 issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n\u2022 fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022 share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key management or scientific personnel;\n\u2022 disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022 announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u2022 sales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other shareholders;\n\u2022 market conditions for biopharmaceutical stocks in general; and\n\u2022 general economic and market conditions.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of shares of our common stock. In addition, such fluctuations could subject us to securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. If the market price of shares of our common stock after this offering does not exceed the initial public offering price, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment.\nInsiders have substantial control over our company after our initial public offering in April 2015 and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.\nRight after our April 2015 offering, our directors, executive officers and principal shareholders, together with their affiliates, beneficially own, in the aggregate, at least 10 million shares or approximately 32% of our outstanding common stock, and could own up to 13 Million shares or 40% of our outstanding common stock if they fully exercise their outstanding stock options or shares. As a result, these shareholders, if acting together, have the ability to determine the outcome of matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these persons, acting together, have the ability to control the management and affairs of our company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may harm the market price of our common stock by:\n\u2022 delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company;\n\u2022 impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving our company; or\n\u2022 discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from our initial public offering in April 2015 and may not use them effectively.\nWe intend to continue to allocate the net proceeds that we received from the April 2015 offering as described below in the \u201cUse of Proceeds\u201d section of our Prospectus. However, our management will have broad discretion in the actual application of the net proceeds, and we may elect to allocate proceeds differently from that described in \u201cUse of Proceeds\u201d if we believe it would be in our best interests to do so. Our shareholders may not agree with the manner in which our management chooses to allocate and spend the net proceeds. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business. Pending their use, we may invest the net proceeds from this offering in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Canadian law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our shareholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur authorized preferred capital stock is available for issuance from time to time at the discretion of our Board of Directors, without shareholder approval. Our Articles of Incorporation (\u201cArticles\u201d) grant our Board of Directors the authority, subject to the corporate law of British Columbia, to determine or alter the special rights and restrictions granted to or imposed on any wholly unissued series of preferred shares, and such rights may be superior to those of our common shares.\nLimitations on the ability to acquire and hold our common shares may be imposed by the Competition Act (Canada). This legislation permits the Commissioner of Competition of Canada to review any acquisition of a significant interest in us. This legislation grants the Commissioner jurisdiction to challenge such an acquisition before the Canadian Competition Tribunal if the Commissioner believes that it would, or would be likely to, result in a substantial lessening or prevention of competition in any market in Canada. The Investment Canada Act (Canada) subjects an acquisition of control of a company by a non-Canadian to government review if the value of our assets as calculated pursuant to the legislation exceeds a threshold amount. A reviewable acquisition may not proceed unless the relevant minister is satisfied that the investment is likely to be a net benefit to Canada.\nAny of the foregoing could prevent or delay a change of control and may deprive or limit strategic opportunities for our shareholders to sell their shares and/or affect the market price of our shares.\nWe may be a passive foreign investment company for US tax purposes which may negatively affect US investors.\nFor US federal income taxation purposes, we will be a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, if in any taxable year either: (a) 75% or more of our gross income consists of passive income; or (b) 50% or more of the value of our assets is attributable to assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income. If we meet either test, our shares held by a US person in that year will be PFIC shares for that year and all subsequent years in which they are held by that person. Because in the past our gross income consisted mostly of interest, we have been a PFIC in prior taxable years. We may also be a PFIC in future taxable years. Gain realized by a US investor from the sale of PFIC shares is taxed as ordinary income, as opposed to capital gain, and subject to an interest charge unless the US person has timely made one of the tax elections described in the section titled \u201cMaterial United States and Canadian Tax Considerations-US Material Federal Income Tax Consequences.\u201d\nWe are governed by the corporate laws in British Columbia, Canada which in some cases have a different effect on shareholders than the corporate laws in Delaware, United States.\nThe material differences between the BCBCA as compared to the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, which may be of most interest to shareholders include the following: (i) for material corporate transactions (such as mergers and amalgamations, other extraordinary corporate transactions, amendments to our Articles) the BCBCA generally requires two-thirds majority vote by shareholders, whereas DGCL generally only requires a majority vote of shareholders for similar material corporate transactions; (ii) the quorum for shareholders meetings is not prescribed under the BCBCA and is only two persons representing 20% of the issued shares under our Articles, whereas under DGCL, quorum requires a minimum of one-third of the shares entitled to vote to be present and companies\u2019 certificates of incorporation frequently require a higher percentage to be present; (iii) under the BCBCA a holder of 5% or more of our common shares can requisition a special meeting at which any matters that can be voted on at our annual meeting can be considered, whereas the DGCL does not give this right; (iv) our Articles require two-thirds majority vote by shareholders to pass a resolution for one or more directors to be removed, whereas DGCL only requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders; however, many public company charters limit removal of directors to a removal for cause; and (v) our Articles may be amended by resolution of our directors to alter our authorized share structure, including to consolidate or subdivide any of our shares, whereas under DGCL, a majority vote by shareholders is generally required to amend a corporation\u2019s certificate of incorporation and a separate class vote may be required to authorize alterations to a corporation\u2019s authorized share structure. We cannot predict if investors will find our common shares less attractive because of these material differences. If some investors find our common shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common shares and our share price may be more volatile.\nFuture sales, or the possibility of future sales, of a substantial number of our common shares could adversely affect the price of the shares and dilute shareholders.\nFuture sales of a substantial number of our common shares, or the perception that such sales will occur, could cause a decline in the market price of our common shares. As at December 31, 2015, we had 32,279,106 common shares outstanding. This includes the common shares sold in the April 2015 offering,\nIn the future, we may issue additional common shares or other equity or debt securities convertible into common shares in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement, employee arrangements or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing shareholders and could cause our common share price to decline.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could result in our common stock being less attractive to investors and adversely affect the market price of our common stock or make it more difficult to raise capital as and when we need it.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as that term is used in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved and exemptions from any rules that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board may adopt requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report on the financial statements. We currently intend to take advantage of some, but not all, of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to us under the JOBS Act, so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d For example, so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may elect not to provide you with certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of our executive officers, that we would otherwise have been required to provide in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our company.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company, which in certain circumstances could be for up to five years. See section in our Prospectus titled, \u201cProspectus Summary-Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company.\u201d\nBecause of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d we may be less attractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. Investors may be unable to compare our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our financial accounting is not as transparent as other companies in our industry. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and future prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, shareholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common shares.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common shares.\nWe will be required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis and our management will be required to assess the effectiveness of these controls annually. However, for as long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404. We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls could detect problems that our management\u2019s assessment might not.", "PERMNO": 15305, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "XBIT"}
