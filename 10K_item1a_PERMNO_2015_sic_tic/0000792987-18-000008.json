Risk Factors\nDownturns in the general economy or the commercial and residential construction industries may adversely affect our revenues and operating results.\nGeneral economic downturns, including downturns in the commercial and residential construction industries, could result in a material decrease in our revenues and operating results. Demand for many of our products, especially in the commercial construction industry, is cyclical. Sales of our products are sensitive to the states of the U.S., foreign and regional economies in general, and in particular, changes in commercial construction spending and government infrastructure spending. In addition, many of our costs are fixed and cannot be quickly reduced in response to decreased demand. The following factors could cause a downturn in the commercial and residential construction industries:\n\u00b7\na decrease in the availability of funds for construction;\n\u00b7\ndeclining economy domestically and internationally;\n\u00b7\nlabor disputes in the construction industry causing work stoppages;\n\u00b7\nrising gas and oil prices;\n\u00b7\nrising steel prices and steel surcharges;\n\u00b7\nrising interest rates;\n\u00b7\nenergy or building materials shortages;\n\u00b7\ninclement weather; and\n\u00b7\navailability of credit for customers.\nDownturns in the general economy and restrictions in the credit markets may negatively impact our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position and access to financing sources by the Company and our customers.\nWorldwide economic conditions and the international credit markets significantly deteriorated in recent years and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. Continued deterioration of economic conditions and credit markets could adversely impact our earnings as sales of our products are sensitive to general declines in U.S. and foreign economies and the ability of our customers to obtain credit. In addition, we rely on the capital markets and the banking markets to meet our financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from our operations. Further disruptions in the capital and credit markets, or deterioration of our creditors' financial condition, could adversely affect the Company's ability to draw on its revolving credit facility. The Company's current credit facility expires in April 2022, and deterioration in the credit markets could make it more difficult or expensive for us to replace our current credit facility, enter into a new credit facility or obtain additional financing.\nA decrease or delay in government funding of highway construction and maintenance may cause our revenues and profits to decrease.\nMany of our customers depend on government funding of highway construction and maintenance and other infrastructure projects. Any decrease or delay in government funding of highway construction and maintenance and other infrastructure projects could cause our net sales and profits to decrease. Historically, federal government funding of infrastructure projects has typically been accomplished through bills that establish funding over a multi-year period, such as the Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act - A Legacy for Users (\"SAFETEA-LU\"), which provided $286.5 billion to fund federal transit projects from 2004 to 2009. SAFETEA-LU funding expired on September 30, 2009, and federal transportation funding operated on a number of shorter term appropriations until December 4, 2015 when the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (\"FAST Act\") was enacted. Among other expenditures, the FAST Act approved funding for highways of approximately $205 billion and funding for transit projects of approximately $48 billion for the five-year period ending September 30, 2020.\nGiven the inherent uncertainty in the political process, the level of government funding for federal highway projects will similarly continue to be uncertain. Governmental funding that is committed or earmarked for federal highway projects is always subject to repeal or reduction. Although continued funding under the FAST Act is expected, it may be at lower levels than originally approved. In addition, Congress could pass legislation in future sessions that would allow for the diversion of previously appropriated highway funds for other national purposes, or it could restrict funding of infrastructure projects unless states comply with certain federal policies.\nThe cyclical nature of our industry and the customization of the equipment we sell may cause adverse fluctuations to our revenues and operating results.\nWe sell equipment primarily to contractors whose demand for equipment depends greatly upon the volume of road or utility construction projects underway or to be scheduled by both government and private entities. The volume and frequency of road and utility construction projects are cyclical; therefore, demand for many of our products is cyclical. The equipment we sell is durable and typically lasts for several years, which also contributes to the cyclical nature of the demand for our products. As a result, we may experience cyclical fluctuations to our revenues and operating results. Any difficulty in managing the Company's manufacturing workflow during downturns in demand could adversely affect our financial results.\nA significant change in the price or availability of oil could reduce demand for our products. Significant increases in the purchase price of certain raw materials used to manufacture our equipment could have a negative impact on the cost of production and related gross margins.\nA significant portion of our revenues relates to the sale of equipment involved in the production, handling, recycling or installation of asphalt mix. Liquid asphalt is a byproduct of the refining of oil, and asphalt prices correlate with the price and availability of oil. An increase in the price of oil or a decrease in the availability of oil would increase the cost of producing asphalt, which would likely decrease demand for asphalt, resulting in decreased demand for many of our products. This would likely cause our revenues and profits to decrease. Rising gasoline, diesel fuel and liquid asphalt prices will also adversely impact the operating and raw material costs of our contractor and aggregate producer customers, and if such customers do not properly adjust their pricing, they could experience reduced profits resulting in possible delays in purchasing capital equipment.\nContrary to the impact of increasing oil prices on many of the Company's products impacted by changes in the cost of asphalt mix as discussed above, the products manufactured by the Company's Energy Group, which are used in drilling for oil and natural gas, in heaters for refineries and oil sands, and in double fluid pump trailers for fracking and oil and gas extraction, would be negatively impacted by lower oil and natural gas prices, to the extent that such lower prices lead to decreased development in the oil and natural gas production industries.\nSteel is a major component in the Company's equipment. Steel prices fluctuate routinely. Our reliance on third-party suppliers for steel and other raw materials exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials. Price increases or a decrease in the availability of these raw materials could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our financial results.\nAcquisitions that we have made in the past and future acquisitions involve risks that could adversely affect our future financial results.\nWe have completed several acquisitions in the past, including the acquisition of RexCon in October 2017 and Power Flame in August 2016. We may acquire additional businesses in the future. We may be unable to achieve the benefits expected to be realized from our acquisitions. In addition, we may incur additional costs and our management's attention may be diverted because of unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other risks inherent in acquiring businesses, including the following:\n\u00b7\nwe may have difficulty integrating the financial and administrative functions of acquired businesses;\n\u00b7\nacquisitions may divert management's attention from our existing operations;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in exchange rates and a weakening of the dollar may impact the competitiveness of acquired businesses;\n\u00b7\nwe may have difficulty in competing successfully for available acquisition candidates, completing future acquisitions or accurately estimating the financial effect of any businesses we acquire;\n\u00b7\nwe may have delays in realizing the benefits of our strategies for an acquired business;\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to retain key employees necessary to continue the operations of the acquired business;\n\u00b7\nacquisition costs may deplete significant cash amounts or may decrease our operating income;\n\u00b7\nwe may choose to acquire a company that is less profitable or has lower profit margins than our company;\n\u00b7\nfuture acquired companies may have unknown liabilities that could require us to spend significant amounts of additional capital; and\n\u00b7\nwe may incur domestic or international economic declines that impact our acquired companies.\nCompetition could reduce revenue from our products and services and cause us to lose market share.\nWe currently face strong competition in product performance, price and service. Some of our domestic and international competitors have greater financial, product development and marketing resources than we have. If competition in our industry intensifies or if our current competitors enhance their products or lower their prices for competing products, we may lose sales or be required to lower the prices we charge for our products. This may reduce revenue from our products and services, lower our gross margins or cause us to lose market share.\nOur success depends on key members of our management and other employees.\nCertain members of our senior management team are of significant importance to our business and operations. The loss of their services may adversely affect our business. In addition, our ability to attract and retain qualified engineers, skilled manufacturing personnel and other professionals, either through direct hiring or acquisition of other businesses employing such professionals, will also be an important factor in determining our future success.\nDifficulties in managing and expanding in international markets could divert management's attention from our existing operations.\nIn 2017, international sales represented approximately 21.3% of our total sales as compared to 18.0% in 2016. We plan to continue our significant sales and production efforts in international markets and recently filled a new company position of Group Managing Director-International to assist with our efforts. In connection with any increase in international sales efforts, we will need to hire, train and retain qualified personnel in countries where language, cultural or regulatory barriers may exist. Any difficulties in expanding our international sales may divert management's attention from our existing operations. In addition, international revenues are subject to the following risks:\n\u00b7\nfluctuating currency exchange rates, which can reduce the profitability of foreign sales;\n\u00b7\nthe burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\ndependence on foreign sales agents;\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic instability of governments;\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of protective legislation such as import or export barriers; and\n\u00b7\nfluctuating strengths or weakness of the dollar, which can impact net sales or the cost of purchased products.\nWe may be unsuccessful in complying with the financial ratio covenants or other provisions of our credit agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in our credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. However, in the future we may be unable to comply with the financial covenants in our credit facility or to obtain waivers with respect to such financial covenants. If such violations occur, the Company's creditors could elect to pursue their contractual remedies under the credit facility, including requiring immediate repayment in full of all amounts then outstanding. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Wells Fargo credit agreement but did have $9,757,000 of letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement. Additional amounts may be borrowed in the future. The Company's Osborn, Astec Brazil, Telestack and Astec Australia subsidiaries have entered into their own independent loan agreements.\nOur quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate, which may decrease our stock price.\nOur quarterly revenues, expenses and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future. As a result, our operating results in some quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. The reasons our quarterly results may fluctuate include:\n\u00b7\ngeneral competitive and economic conditions, domestically and internationally;\n\u00b7\ndelays in, or uneven timing in, the delivery of customer orders;\n\u00b7\nthe seasonal trend in our industry;\n\u00b7\nthe introduction of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nproduct supply shortages; and\n\u00b7\nreduced demand due to adverse weather conditions.\nPeriod-to-period comparisons of such items should not be relied on as indications of future performance.\nWe may face product liability claims or other liabilities due to the nature of our business. If we are unable to obtain or maintain insurance or if our insurance does not cover liabilities, we may incur significant costs which could reduce our profitability.\nWe manufacture heavy machinery, which is used by our customers at excavation and construction sites, ports and inland terminals and on high-traffic roads. Any defect in or improper operation of our equipment can result in personal injury and death, and damage to or destruction of property, any of which could cause product liability claims to be filed against us. The amount and scope of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities we may incur in the event of a product liability claim. We may not be able to maintain insurance of the types or at the levels we deem necessary or adequate or at rates we consider reasonable. Any liabilities not covered by insurance could reduce our profitability or have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIf we are unable to protect our proprietary technology from infringement or if our technology infringes technology owned by others, then the demand for our products may decrease or we may be forced to modify our products, which could increase our costs.\nWe hold numerous patents covering technology and applications related to many of our products and systems as well as numerous trademarks and trade names registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in foreign countries. Our existing or future patents or trademarks may not adequately protect us against infringements, and pending patent or trademark applications may not result in issued patents or trademarks. Our patents, registered trademarks and patent applications, if any, may not be upheld if challenged, and competitors may develop similar or superior methods or products outside the protection of our patents. This could reduce demand for our products and materially decrease our revenues. If our products are deemed to infringe upon the patents or proprietary rights of others, we could be required to modify the design of our products, change the name of our products or obtain a license for the use of some of the technologies used in our products. We may be unable to do any of the foregoing in a timely manner, upon acceptable terms and conditions, or at all, and the failure to do so could cause us to incur additional costs or lose revenues.\nIf we become subject to increased governmental regulation, we may incur significant costs.\nOur hot-mix asphalt plants contain air pollution control equipment and several of our other products contain engines that must comply with performance standards promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency. These performance standards may increase in the future. Changes in these requirements could cause us to undertake costly measures to redesign or modify our equipment or otherwise adversely affect the manufacturing processes of our products. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIn addition, we may incur material costs or liabilities in connection with other regulatory requirements applicable to our business, including, for example, state regulation of our component equipment, the accuracy of weights and measures, and the maximum weight transportable on highways and roads.\nAs an innovative leader in the industries in which we operate, we occasionally undertake the engineering, design, manufacturing, construction and installation of equipment systems that are new to the market. Estimating the costs of such innovative equipment can be difficult and could result in our realization of significantly reduced or negative margins on such projects. Additionally, if the newly designed equipment were not to function as expected, the Company could be responsible for reimbursing the customer for its financial losses, including, but not limited to, the possible refund of the purchase price.\nAt various times, we have experienced negative margins on certain large projects, including wood pellet plants recently produced. These large projects have included both existing and innovative equipment designs, on-site construction and promised minimum production levels. Designing innovative equipment to function as expected is inherently difficult and significant additional design phase, field testing and redesign costs may be incurred. In addition, any number of unforeseen circumstances, can impact actual project costs. Production delays, design changes and adverse weather conditions, etc. can also result in construction and testing delays which can cause significant cost overruns or the missing of required completion dates. In certain circumstances, we may incur contractual penalties as a result of such delays or minimum production levels, and be liable to customers for other losses they incur in connection with such delays, including possible refund of the purchase price. We may not be able to sufficiently predict the extent of such unforeseen cost overruns and may experience significant losses on specialized projects in the future. Additionally, the Company typically incurs substantial research and development costs each year and has historically received significant research and development tax credits due to these expenditures. Congress could reduce or eliminate such tax credits in future years, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and Tennessee law may inhibit a takeover, which could delay or prevent a transaction in which shareholders might receive a premium over market price for their shares.\nOur charter and bylaws and Tennessee law contain provisions that may delay, deter or inhibit a future acquisition or an attempt to obtain control of us. This could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if a substantial number or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest. These provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us or obtaining control of us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our Board of Directors in connection with the transaction. Provisions that could delay, deter or inhibit a future acquisition or an attempt to obtain control of us include the following:\n\u00b7\nhaving a staggered Board of Directors;\n\u00b7\nrequiring a two-thirds vote of the total number of shares issued and outstanding to remove directors other than for cause;\n\u00b7\nrequiring advance notice of actions proposed by shareholders for consideration at shareholder meetings;\n\u00b7\nlimiting the right of shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders;\n\u00b7\nrequiring that all shareholders entitled to vote on an action provide written consent in order for shareholders to act without holding a shareholders' meeting; and\n\u00b7\nbeing governed by the Tennessee Control Share Acquisition Act.", "PERMNO": 10382, "SIC": 3531, "TIC": "ASTE"}
