Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially and adversely affected if any of these risks occurs, and as a result, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth below.\nRisks Related to AerSale\u2019s Business and Industry\nThe coronavirus pandemic has had a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity, and the duration and extent of the pandemic could prolong or increase the adverse impact.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility in financial and other markets, which has raised the prospect of an extended global recession. The commercial aviation industry, including our operations, has been particularly and adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health problems resulting from COVID-19 and precautionary measures instituted by governments and businesses to mitigate its spread, including travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place directives, and shutting down of non-essential businesses has and continues to contribute to a general slowdown in the global economy, and if it continues for an extended period of time, it could have a material adverse impact to the businesses of our customers, suppliers and distribution partners, and disrupt our operations. Changes in our operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or employee illnesses resulting from the pandemic, may result in inefficiencies or delays, including in sales and product development efforts and our manufacturing and supply chain, and additional costs related to business continuity initiatives, that cannot be fully mitigated through succession planning, employees working remotely, or teleconferencing technologies. The spread of COVID-19 along with related travel restrictions and operational issues has caused a decrease in the demand for air travel and has resulted in lower demand from civil aviation customers for our products. Passenger airline traffic has declined significantly since March 2020, and the decrease had a material negative impact on the financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect to continue to see reduced demand in our non-cargo commercial businesses. Moreover, if the COVID-19 pandemic continues to result in decreased worldwide commercial activity, it could eventually adversely affect the demand for airline cargo services. Reduced numbers of aircraft flying or flight hours negatively impacts the demand for many of our products and services, and any prolonged reduction could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity. While the full extent and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be reasonably estimated with certainty at this time, COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our business, the businesses of our customers and suppliers, as well as our results of operations and financial condition, and may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition in the long-term.\nIn addition, we source parts and components for our business from various suppliers around the world. Disruptions to our supply chain and business operations, or to our suppliers\u2019 or customers\u2019 supply chains and business operations, could have adverse effects on our ability to provide aftermarket support and services. Moreover, a prolonged epidemic or pandemic, or the threat thereof, could result in worker absences, lower productivity, voluntary closure of our offices and facilities, travel restrictions for our employees and other disruptions to our business. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have taken a number of actions in response to the decreased demand for certain products and services as a result of COVID-19, including reducing operating expenditures by eliminating certain contractor positions and reducing all non-essential spending. Certain of our facilities have experienced temporary disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we cannot predict whether any of our facilities will experience more significant disruptions in the future.\nWe have also taken steps to improve our liquidity, including seeking financial assistance under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d). Certain of our subsidiaries have received $16.4 million from the U.S. Treasury Department (\u201cTreasury\u201d) through the Payroll Support Program (\u201cPSP1\u201d) under the CARES Act, of which $12.7 million was received prior to December 31, 2020 and the remaining amount was received during the first quarter of 2021. As part of the Payroll Support Extension Law (\u201cPSP Extension Law\u201d), we entered into a new agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury (\u201cPSP2\u201d) on March 4, 2021 for the receipt of relief funds of $5.5 million. In connection with the financial assistance we have received under the Payroll Support Program, we are required to comply with certain provisions of the CARES Act, including the requirement that funds provided pursuant to the Payroll Support Program be used exclusively for the continuation of payment of employee wages, salaries and benefits; the requirement against involuntary terminations and furloughs and reductions in employee pay rates and benefits from the signing date of the Payroll Support Program agreement through March 31, 2021. The agreement requires us to issue a recall to any employee who was terminated or furloughed between October 1, 2020 and March 4, 2021 and enable such employee to return to employment. In addition, we are subject to provisions prohibiting the repurchase of common stock and the payment of common stock dividends through March 31, 2022, as well as limitations on the payment of certain employee compensation through October 1, 2022. These restrictions may affect our operations and if we do not comply with these provisions, we may be required to reimburse up to 100% any previously received relief funds. In particular, limitations on compensation may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain senior management or attract other key employees during this critical time.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, and each of their financial conditions; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us. The impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, any of which could have a material effect on us.\nWe are affected by factors that adversely impact the commercial aviation industry.\nAs a provider of products and services to the commercial aviation industry, we are generally affected by overall economic conditions of that industry. The commercial aviation industry is historically cyclical and has been negatively affected in the past by geopolitical events, high fuel and oil prices, lack of capital, and weak economic conditions. As a result of these and other events, from time to time certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operation. The impact of instability in the global financial markets has led, and may in the future lead, airlines to reduce domestic or international capacity. In addition, certain of our airline customers have in the past been impacted by tight credit markets, which limited their ability to buy parts, services, and Flight Equipment.\nA reduction in flight activity of aircraft both in the United States and abroad has resulted in, and may continue to result in, reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraft affected. Further, tight credit conditions negatively impact the amount of liquidity available to buy parts, services, and Flight Equipment. A deteriorating airline environment may also result in additional airline bankruptcies, and in such circumstances we may not be able to fully collect outstanding accounts receivable. Reduced demand from customers caused by weak economic conditions, including tight credit conditions and customer bankruptcies, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. A slowdown in the global economy, or a return to a recession, would negatively impact the commercial aviation industry, and may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to profitably manage mid-life Flight Equipment through the end of its life-cycles depends in part on our ability to successfully source acquisition opportunities of used Flight Equipment on favorable terms to provide feedstock for the sale of USM parts. Our inability to acquire Flight Equipment could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth rates may be adversely affected by these and other events that impact the aviation industry, including the following:\n\u2022 deterioration in the financial condition of our existing and potential customers;\n\u2022 reductions in demand for used Flight Equipment;\n\u2022 increased in-house maintenance by airlines;\n\u2022 lack of new and/or USM parts in the marketplace;\n\u2022 the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022 acts of terrorism;\n\u2022 future outbreaks of infectious diseases such as the novel coronavirus; and\n\u2022 acts of God.\nOur operating results vary, and comparisons to results for preceding periods may not be meaningful. Due to a number of factors our operating results may fluctuate, including for the following reasons:\n\u2022 the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022 the timing and number of purchases and sales of Flight Equipment;\n\u2022 the timing and amount of maintenance reserve revenues recorded resulting from the termination of long term leases, for which significant amounts of maintenance reserves may have accumulated;\n\u2022 the termination, or announced termination of production, of particular types of Flight Equipment;\n\u2022 the retirement or announced retirement of particular aircraft models by aircraft operators;\n\u2022 seasonality of travel;\n\u2022 the operating history of any particular engine, aircraft or engine or aircraft model; and\n\u2022 the timing of necessary overhauls of Flight Equipment.\nThese risks may reduce our Flight Equipment utilization rates, lease margins, maintenance reserve revenues and proceeds from Flight Equipment sales, and result in higher legal, technical, maintenance, storage, insurance and other costs related to repossession and Flight Equipment being off-lease. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, the availability of Flight Equipment for lease or sale periodically experiences cycles of oversupply and undersupply of given engine or aircraft models. The incidence of an oversupply of Flight Equipment may produce substantial decreases in lease rates and the appraised or resale value of aviation equipment and may increase the time spent and costs incurred to lease or sell Flight Equipment. We anticipate that fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future. As a result, we believe that comparisons to results for preceding periods may not be meaningful, and that results of prior periods should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nMarket values for our aviation products fluctuate, and we may be unable to recover our costs incurred with respect to engines, rotable components and other aircraft parts.\nWe make a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of rotable components, engines, and other assets which are on lease, available for lease, or supporting our long-term programs. These assumptions include historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, maintenance expenses, residual values, future demand, and future cash flows. Reductions in demand for these assets or declining market values, as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions we utilize in determining the recoverability of our Flight Equipment could result in impairment charges in future periods, which may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe value of any given aircraft model, or any engine model applicable thereto, can vary significantly based on supply in the market place. Certain types of Flight Equipment may be used in significant numbers by commercial aircraft operators that experience financial difficulties from time to time. If such operators were to go into liquidation or similar proceedings, the resulting over-supply of Flight Equipment from these operators could have an adverse effect on the demand for the affected engine and aircraft types and the values of such Flight Equipment, which may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to repossess Flight Equipment when a lessee defaults, and even if we are able to repossess the Flight Equipment from a defaulting lessee, we may have to expend significant resources in the repossession of such Flight Equipment and the subsequent remarketing and re-leasing of the repossessed Flight Equipment.\nWhen a lessee defaults on its obligations under a lease and does not cure such default in a timely manner, we typically seek to terminate the applicable lease and repossess the leased Flight Equipment. If a defaulting lessee contests the termination and repossession or is under court protection, enforcement of our rights under the lease may be difficult, expensive and time-consuming. In the event the Flight Equipment is located outside of the United States, we may need to obtain governmental consents to export the Flight Equipment back to the United States. As a result, the relevant asset may be off-lease and not generating revenue for a prolonged period. In addition, we will incur direct costs associated with repossessing our Flight Equipment, which may include legal and similar costs, costs of transporting, storing and insuring the Flight Equipment, and costs associated with necessary maintenance and recordkeeping to make the Flight Equipment available for re-lease or sale. During this time, we will not realize revenue from the Flight Equipment being repossessed and will continue to be obligated to pay any debt financing related to the Flight Equipment. If an engine is installed on an airframe, the airframe may be owned by an aircraft lessor or other third party. Our ability to recover engines installed on airframes owned by third-parties may depend on the cooperation of the airframe owner.\nAdditionally, when a lessee of our Flight Equipment protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, creditors (including us) are automatically stayed from enforcing their rights. In the case of U.S.-certificated airlines, Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code provides certain relief to lessors of aircraft equipment. Section 1110 has been the subject of significant litigation, and we can give no assurance that Section 1110 will protect our investment in Flight Equipment in the event of a lessee\u2019s bankruptcy. In addition, Section 1110 does not apply to lessees located outside of the United States, and applicable foreign laws may not provide comparable protection to us.\nWe are subject to significant government regulation and may need to incur significant expenses to comply with new or more stringent governmental regulation.\nThe aviation industry is highly regulated in the United States by the FAA and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Prior to being placed into service the products and services that we provide for aircraft, engines and their components are required to meet certain standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries. We also operate repair stations that are licensed by the FAA and the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries. Specific regulations vary from country to country; although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance with FAA requirements. New and more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted in the future that, if enacted, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nAny revocation or suspension of our material licenses, certificates, authorizations, or approvals by the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nUsers of Flight Equipment are regulated by general civil aviation authorities, including the FAA in the United States and similar governmental authorities in other countries, which regulate the maintenance of engines and issue airworthiness directives. Airworthiness directives typically set forth special maintenance actions or modifications with respect to certain engine and aircraft types or series of specific engines that must be implemented for the engine or aircraft to remain in service. Also, airworthiness directives may require the lessee to make more frequent inspections of an engine, aircraft or particular engine parts. Generally, the lessee of our Flight Equipment is responsible for complying with all airworthiness directives. However, if the Flight Equipment is off-lease and in certain circumstances, if dictated by the terms of a Flight Equipment lease, we may be forced to bear the cost of compliance with such airworthiness directives.\nA number of our leases require specific governmental or regulatory licenses, consents or approvals. These include consents for certain payments under the leases and for the export, import or re-export of our Flight Equipment. Consents needed in connection with future leasing or sale of our Flight Equipment may not be received timely or have economically feasible terms. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to lease or sell Flight Equipment, which, in turn, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce (the \u201cCommerce Department\u201d) regulates exports of goods outside the United States. We are subject to the Commerce Department\u2019s and the U.S. Department of State\u2019s regulations with respect to the lease and sale of aircraft, engines, engine parts and components, and airframes and accessory parts and components to foreign entities. The Commerce Department and the U.S. Department of State may, in certain cases, require us to obtain export licenses for certain items exported to foreign countries. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, enforces regulations related to the import of aircraft, engines, engine parts and components, and airframe and accessory parts and components into the United States. We must expend resources to comply with these regulations and our failure to comply with these regulations may subject us to regulatory actions, which may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are prohibited from doing business with persons designated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) on its \u201cSpecially Designated Nationals List,\u201d and must monitor our operations and existing and potential lessees and other counterparties for compliance with OFAC\u2019s rules. Similarly, sanctions issued by the United Nations, the United States government, the European Union or other governments could prohibit or restrict us from doing business in certain countries, or with certain customers or persons, and we must monitor our operations and existing and potential customers and other counterparties for compliance with such sanctions. We must expend resources to comply with these regulations and our failure to comply with these regulations may subject us to regulatory actions, which may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are also subject to a variety of other regulations including work-related and community safety laws. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 mandates general requirements for safe workplaces for all employees, and established the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) in the Department of Labor. In particular, OSHA provides special procedures and measures for the handling of certain hazardous and toxic substances. In addition, specific safety standards have been promulgated for workplaces engaged in the treatment, disposal or storage of hazardous waste. Requirements under state law, in certain circumstances, may mandate additional measures for facilities handling materials specified as extremely dangerous. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with OSHA\u2019s health and safety requirements.\nSuccess at our MRO facilities is dependent upon continued outsourcing by the airlines.\nWe currently perform MRO activities at six leased locations. Revenues at these facilities fluctuate based on demand for maintenance which, in turn, is driven by the number of aircraft operating and the extent of outsourcing of maintenance activities by airlines. In addition, certain airlines operate new fleet types and/or newer generation aircraft and we may not have contractual arrangements to service these aircraft, nor technicians trained and certified to perform the required airframe maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities on such aircraft. If either the number of aircraft operating or the level of outsourcing of maintenance activities for the aircraft models for which we are authorized to service declines, we may not be able to execute our operational and financial plans at our MRO facilities, which may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations would be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled personnel or work stoppages.\nWe are dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce because of the complex nature of many of our products and services. Our ability to operate successfully and meet our customers\u2019 demands could be jeopardized if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, including qualified licensed mechanics, to conduct our business, or if we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage. These and similar events may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe inability to obtain certain components and raw materials from suppliers could harm our business.\nOur business is affected by the availability and price of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our products. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers\u2019 ability to adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. The supply chains for our business could also be disrupted by external events such as natural disasters, extreme weather events, labor disputes, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes. As a result, our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications when required, and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their non-performance. Transitions to new suppliers may result in significant costs and delays, including those related to the required recertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers and/or regulatory agencies. Our inability to fill our supply needs could jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under customer contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. Further, increased costs of such raw materials or components could reduce our profits if we were unable to pass along such price increases on to our customers.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets, and competitive pressures may adversely affect us.\nThe markets for our products and services are highly competitive, and we face competition from a number of sources, both domestic and international. Our competitors include aircraft manufacturers, aircraft component and parts manufacturers, airline and aircraft service companies, other companies MRO services, other aircraft spare parts distributors and redistributors. Certain of our competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and others may price their products and services below our selling prices. These competitive markets also create pressure on our ability to hire and retain qualified technicians and other skilled labor needs. We believe that our ability to compete depends on superior customer service and support, on-time delivery, sufficient inventory availability, competitive pricing, and effective quality assurance programs. These competitive pressures have a potential impact on our business, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.\nWe conduct business in a number of foreign countries, certain of which are politically unstable or subject to military or civil conflicts. Consequently, we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:\n\u2022 military conflicts, civil strife, and political risks;\n\u2022 export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;\n\u2022 compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, and other anti-bribery and anticorruption laws;\n\u2022 the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations;\n\u2022 contract award and funding delays;\n\u2022 potential restrictions on transfers of funds;\n\u2022 import and export duties and value added taxes;\n\u2022 foreign exchange risk;\n\u2022 transportation delays and interruptions;\n\u2022 uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations; and\n\u2022 changes in United States policies on trade relations and trade policy, including implementation of or changes in trade sanctions, tariffs, and embargoes.\nFollowing a national referendum and enactment of legislation by the government of the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union and ratified a trade and cooperation agreement governing its future relationship with the European Union. The agreement, which is being applied provisionally from January 1, 2021 until it is ratified by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, addresses trade, economic arrangements, law enforcement, judicial cooperation and a governance framework including procedures for dispute resolution, among other things. Because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and will require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation, significant political and economic uncertainty remains about how the precise terms of the relationship between the parties will differ from the terms before withdrawal. These developments, or the perception that any related developments could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and financial markets, and could significantly reduce global market liquidity, restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets, increase restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and other countries and increase regulatory complexities. Asset valuations, currency exchange rates and credit ratings have been and may continue to be subject to increased market volatility. Lack of clarity about future United Kingdom laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate, including with respect to trade relations could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital.\nMeasures that we have or will adopt to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business internationally may not be adequate, and the regions in which we operate might not continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all.\nLiens on our Flight Equipment could exceed the value of such Flight Equipment, which could negatively affect our ability to repossess, lease or sell such Flight Equipment.\nLiens in favor of third parties may be attached to Flight Equipment we own, and in certain cases our engines may also be installed on airframes to which liens in favor of third-parties unrelated to the engines have been attached. These liens may secure substantial sums that may in certain circumstances exceed the value of the particular Flight Equipment to which the liens have attached. In certain jurisdictions, a lien may give the lien holder the right to detain, in limited cases, sell or cause the forfeiture of the Flight Equipment subject to the lien. Liens held by third parties may have priority over our and our creditors\u2019 interest in respective AerSale Flight Equipment, either because the third-party liens have priority under applicable local law, or because our creditors\u2019 security interests are not filed in jurisdictions outside the United States. These liens and lien holders could impair our ability to repossess and re-lease, or sell our Flight Equipment. If our customers do not discharge these liens, we may find it necessary to pay the claims secured by such liens to repossess the Flight Equipment subject to such third-party liens.\nIn certain countries, an engine affixed to an aircraft may become an accession to the aircraft and we may not be able to exercise our ownership rights over the engine.\nIn certain jurisdictions, leased engine affixed to an aircraft may become an accession to the aircraft, such that the ownership rights of the owner of the aircraft supersede the ownership rights of the owner of the engine. If an aircraft is security for the owner\u2019s obligations to a third-party, the security interest in the aircraft may supersede our rights as owner of the engine. This legal principle could limit our ability to repossess leased engine in the event of a lessee\u2019s bankruptcy or lease default while the aircraft with the engine installed remains in such a jurisdiction. We may suffer a loss if we are not able to repossess engines leased to lessees in these jurisdictions.\nBusiness acquisitions expose us to risks, including the risk that we may be unable to effectively integrate acquired businesses.\nWe have completed multiple acquisitions over the past few years, and have discussions with third parties regarding acquisitions on a regular basis. Acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel, the effects of amortization of any acquired intangible assets and the potential impairment of goodwill, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired business. In addition, acquisitions often require substantial management resources, and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business. For any businesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to execute our operational, financial, or integration plans for the acquired businesses, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are dependent upon continued availability of financing to manage our business and to execute our business strategy, and additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us.\nOur ability to manage our business and to execute our business strategy is dependent, in part, on the continued availability of debt and equity capital. Access to the debt and equity capital markets may be limited by various factors, including the condition of overall credit markets, general economic factors, state of the aviation industry, our financial performance, and credit ratings. Debt and equity capital may not continue to be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur existing debt includes restrictive and financial covenants.\nCertain current financing arrangements require us to comply with various restrictive covenants, and in certain cases contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan and debt agreements, and may result in a cross-default under other debt agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our failure to comply with these covenants may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our receipt of funds under the CARES Act requires us to comply with certain covenants. If we do not comply with these covenants, the government may require us to repay the support given to us.\nOur industry is susceptible to product and other liability claims, and claims not adequately covered by insurance may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business exposes us to possible claims for property damage and bodily injury or death, which may result if an aircraft, engine, engine part or component, airframe part or accessory, or any other aviation product that we have sold, manufactured, or repaired fails, or if Flight Equipment we serviced or leased, or in which our products are installed, has an accident. We carry substantial liability insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate for our risk exposure, and commensurate with industry norms. However, claims may arise in the future, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us in all circumstances. Additionally, we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability claim not covered by adequate insurance may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to unique business risks as a result of supplying equipment and services to the U.S. government directly and as a subcontractor, which could lead to a reduction in our net sales from, or the profitability of our supply arrangements with, the U.S. government.\nCompanies engaged in supplying defense-related equipment and services to U.S. government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry. We currently do, and may in the future, contract directly with the U.S. government or act as a subcontractor to customers contracting with the U.S. government. Accordingly, the U.S. government may unilaterally suspend or prohibit us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations, revoke required security clearance, reduce the value of existing contracts, or audit our contract related costs and fees.\nIn addition, because we contract directly with the U.S. government or act as a subcontractor to customers contracting with the U.S. government, we may be subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under government contracts. U.S. government agencies routinely audit government contractors to review performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and compliance with internal control systems and policies, including the contractor\u2019s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract are not reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Also, any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in payments being withheld, penalties and reduced future business, and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.\nOur business depends heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. Our systems and technologies, or those of third parties on which we rely, could fail or become unreliable due to equipment failures, software viruses, cyber threats, ransomware attacks, terrorist acts, natural disasters, power failures or other causes.\nCyber security threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information, business e-mail compromises, ransomware attacks, and other electronic security breaches, including at our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and joint venture partners, that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data.\nThe procedures and controls we utilize to monitor and mitigate these threats may not be sufficient to prevent security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified, and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nMoreover, expenditures incurred in implementing and maintaining cyber security and other procedures and controls may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe must comply with extensive environmental requirements, and any exposure to environmental liabilities may adversely affect us.\nCompliance with federal, state, and local requirements relating to the discharge and emission of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes, the remediation and abatement of contaminants, and other activities affecting the environment, have had and may continue to have an impact on our operations. Certain of our facilities, including facilities acquired and operated by us or one of our subsidiaries, have at one time or another been under active investigation for environmental contamination by federal or state agencies. We cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future environmental requirements, or of future environmental claims for which we may not have adequate indemnification or insurance coverage. If we were required to pay the expenses related to any future environmental claims for which neither indemnification nor insurance coverage were available, these expenses may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFuture regulatory developments in the United States and abroad concerning environmental issues such as climate change could adversely affect our operations, and increase operating costs, and through their impact on our customers reduce demand for our products and services. Actions may be taken in the future by the U.S. government, state governments within the United States, foreign governments, or the International Civil Aviation Organization to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry. The precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to us and our customers are difficult to predict, but the impact to us and the aviation industry, including the potential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, or a requirement to purchase carbon credits, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may need to make significant capital expenditures to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.\nThe industries in which we participate are constantly undergoing development and change, and it is likely that new products, equipment, and MRO methods will be introduced in the future. We may need to make significant expenditures to purchase new equipment, and to train our employees to keep pace with any new technological developments. These expenditures may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe do not own certain intellectual property and tooling that is important to our business.\nIn our MRO business, OEMs of equipment that we maintain for our customers include language in repair manuals relating to their equipment asserting broad claims of proprietary rights to the contents of the manuals used in our operations. Although we believe that our use of manufacture and repair manuals is lawful, there can be no assurance that OEMs will not try to enforce such claims, including through the possible use of legal proceedings, or that any such actions will be unsuccessful.\nOur business also depends on using certain intellectual property and tooling that we have rights to use pursuant to license grants under our contracts with OEM customers. These contracts contain restrictions on our use of the intellectual property and tooling, and may be terminated if we violate certain of these restrictions. Our loss of a contract with an OEM customer and the related license rights to use an OEM\u2019s intellectual property or tooling, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations depend on our facilities, which are subject to physical and other risks that could disrupt production.\nOur facilities or our customers\u2019 facilities could be damaged or disrupted by a natural disaster, war, or terrorist activity. A major catastrophe, such as an earthquake, hurricane, fire, flood, tornado, pandemic, or other natural disaster at any of our sites, or war or terrorist activities in any of the areas where we conduct operations, could result in a prolonged interruption of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in shipments of products, and the loss of sales and customers, and we may not have insurance to adequately compensate us for any of these events. For leased facilities, timely renewal of leases, and risk mitigation from the sale of our leased facilities, is required to avoid any business interruption.\nOur reputation, ability to do business and financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees, agents, subcontractors, suppliers, business partners or joint ventures in which we participate.\nWe have implemented policies, procedures, training and other compliance controls, and have negotiated terms designed to prevent misconduct by employees, agents or others working on our behalf or with us that would violate the applicable laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws governing improper payments to government officials, the protection of export controlled products and services, cost accounting and billing, competition and data privacy. However, we cannot ensure that it will prevent all such misconduct committed by our employees, agents, subcontractors, suppliers, business partners or others working on our behalf or with us, and this risk of improper conduct may increase as we expand globally. In the ordinary course of business we may form and/or become a member of joint ventures. We may be unable to prevent misconduct or other violations of applicable laws by these joint ventures (including their officers, directors and employees) or our partners. Improper actions by those with whom or through whom we do business (including our employees, agents, subcontractors, suppliers, business partners and joint ventures) could subject us to administrative, civil or criminal investigations and monetary and non-monetary penalties, including suspension and debarment, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to certain limitations on employee compensation pursuant to the CARES Act.\nIn connection with the financial assistance we have received and may in the future receive through the Payroll Support Program, and loan program under the CARES Act pursuant to the CARES Act, we are subject to the limitations on the payment of certain employee compensation through October 1, 2022. These restrictions will materially affect our operations, and we may not be successful in managing these impacts for the duration of the restrictions. In particular, limitations on compensation may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain senior management, or attract other key employees during this critical time.\nOur business might suffer if we were to lose the services of certain key employees.\nOur business operations depend upon our key employees, including our executive officers. Because our key employees have knowledge of our industry and customers, and would be difficult to replace, loss of any of these employees may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf any of our customers were to become insolvent or experience substantial financial difficulties, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf any of the customers with whom we do business become insolvent or experiences substantial financial difficulties, we may be unable to timely collect amounts owed to us by such customers, and may not be able to sell the inventory we have purchased for such customers, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could become involved in intellectual property litigation, which could have a material and adverse impact on our profitability.\nWe and other companies in our industry possess certain proprietary rights relating to designs, engineering, manufacturing processes and MRO procedures. In the event that we believe that a third party is infringing upon our proprietary rights, we may bring an action to enforce such rights. In addition, third parties may claim infringement by us with respect to their proprietary rights and may initiate legal proceedings against us in the future. The expense and time of bringing an action to enforce such rights or defending against infringement claims can be significant, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIntellectual property litigation involves complex legal and factual questions which makes the outcome of any such proceedings subject to considerable uncertainty. Not only can such litigation divert management\u2019s attention, but it can also expose us to damages and potential injunctive relief which, if granted, may preclude us from making, using or selling particular products or technology. The expense and time associated with such litigation may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisk Factors Related to our common stock\nAn active, liquid trading market for our common stock may not continue.\nIt is possible that an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. If an active and liquid trading market does not continue, our stockholders may have difficulty selling any of our common stock. Among other things, in the absence of a liquid public trading market:\n\u2022 you may not be able to liquidate your investment in shares of common stock;\n\u2022 you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price attributed to them in the business combination;\n\u2022 the market price of shares of common stock may experience significant price volatility; and\n\u2022 there may be less efficiency in carrying out your purchase and sale orders.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. If no or few analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price of our stock could be negatively affected. Even if we do obtain analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of our common stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover our common stock, we could lose visibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our common stock price to decline.\nSubstantial future sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares. Certain shares of our common stock are freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for any shares of our common stock that may be held or acquired by our directors, executive officers, and other affiliates, as that term is defined in the Securities Act, which are be restricted securities under the Securities Act. Restricted securities may not be sold in the public market unless the sale is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration is available. Certain of our stockholders and members of our management have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering shares of our common stock or to include shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. Any such sales, including sales of a substantial number of shares or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. We may also issue shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in ownership dilution to you as a stockholder and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur management has limited experience in operating a public company.\nOur executive officers have limited experience in the management of a publicly traded company. Our management team may not successfully or effectively manage our transition to a public company that will be subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under federal securities laws. Their limited experience in dealing with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies could be a significant disadvantage in that it is likely that an increasing amount of their time may be devoted to these activities which will result in less time being devoted to our management and our growth. We may not have adequate personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience, and training in the accounting policies, practices or internal controls over financial reporting required of public companies in the United States. The development and implementation of the standards and controls necessary for us to achieve the level of accounting standards required of a public company in the United States may require costs greater than expected. It is possible that we will be required to expand our employee base and hire additional employees to support our operations as a public company which will increase our operating costs in future periods.\nWe will incur increased costs as a result of becoming a public company.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, insurance, and other expenses that we have not incurred as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also have incurred and will incur costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules implemented by the SEC. The expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes generally have been increasing. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. In estimating these costs, we took into account expenses related to insurance, legal, accounting, and compliance activities, as well as other expenses not currently incurred. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on our board committees, or as our executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions, and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nOur business and financial results may be affected by various litigation and regulatory proceedings.\nWe are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future. These proceedings have included, and in the future may include, matters involving personnel and employment issues, workers\u2019 compensation, personal and property injury, disputes relating to acquisitions (including contingent consideration), governmental investigations and other proceedings. Some historical and current legal proceedings and future legal proceedings may purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties including with respect to employment-related matters. We cannot be certain of the ultimate outcomes of any such claims, and resolution of these types of matters against us may result in significant fines, judgments or settlements, which, if uninsured, or if the fines, judgments and settlements exceed insured levels, could adversely affect our business or financial results.", "PERMNO": 18410, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "MNCL"}
