Any downturn in sales of these products would adversely affect our business, revenue, operating results, and financial condition. Similarly, a softening of demand in the smartphone market, the tablet market, or the notebook portion of the PC product applications market, or a slowdown of growth in the mobile product applications market because of consumer preferences, the emergence of applications not including our solutions, or other factors would cause our business, operating results, and financial position to suffer.\nNet revenue from our human interface solutions for mobile product applications has been volatile in the past, and may not increase or be less volatile in the future.\nNet revenue from our human interface solutions for mobile product applications, particularly smartphones, has been volatile in the past. Our net revenue from our human interface solutions for mobile product applications may not increase or be less volatile in the future. Net revenue from our human interface solutions for mobile product applications was $1,459.5 million for fiscal 2016, $1,442.1 million for fiscal 2015, and $689.8 million for fiscal 2014. Our human interface business for mobile product applications faces many uncertainties, including our success in enhancing our position in evolving markets dominated by a limited number of OEMs, and market acceptance of our product solutions over competitive product solutions. Our inability to address these uncertainties successfully would negatively affect our business.\nWe are exposed to industry downturns and cyclicality in our target markets that may result in fluctuations in our operating results.\nThe consumer electronics industry has experienced significant economic downturns at various times. These downturns are characterized by diminished product demand, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, and production overcapacity. In addition, the consumer electronics industry is cyclical in nature. We seek to reduce our exposure to industry downturns and cyclicality by providing design and production services for leading companies in rapidly expanding industry segments. We may, however, experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results because of general industry conditions or events occurring in the general economy.\nWe cannot assure you that our human interface business for new markets will be successful or that we will be able to continue to generate significant revenue from these markets.\nOur product solutions may not be successful in new markets despite the fact that these product solutions are capable of enabling people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of mobile computing, communication, entertainment, automotive and electronic devices in addition to notebook computers and smartphones.\nVarious target markets for our interface solutions, such as automotive touchscreens, may develop slower than anticipated or could utilize competing technologies. The markets for certain of these products depend in part upon the continued development and deployment of wireless and other technologies, which may or may not address the needs of the users of these products.\nOur ability to generate significant revenue from new markets will depend on various factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe development and growth of these markets;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our technologies and product solutions to address the needs of these markets, the price and performance requirements of OEMs, and the preferences of end users; and\n\u00b7\nour ability to provide OEMs with human interface solutions that provide advantages in terms of size, power consumption, reliability, durability, performance, and value-added features compared with alternative solutions.\nMany manufacturers of these products have well-established relationships with competitive suppliers. Our ongoing success in these markets will require us to offer better performance alternatives to other solutions at competitive costs. The failure of any of these target markets to develop as we expect, or our failure to serve these markets to a significant extent, will impede our sales growth and could result in substantially reduced earnings and a restructuring of our operations. We cannot predict the size or growth rate of these markets or the market share we will achieve or maintain in these markets in the future.\nIf we fail to maintain and build relationships with our customers, or our customers\u2019 products which utilize our human interface solutions do not gain widespread market acceptance, our revenue may stagnate or decline.\nWe do not sell any products to end users and we do not control or influence the manufacture, promotion, distribution, or pricing of the products that incorporate our human interface solutions. Instead, we design various human interface solutions that our OEM customers incorporate into their products, and we depend on such OEM customers to successfully manufacture and distribute products incorporating our solutions and to generate consumer demand through marketing and promotional activities. As a result of this, our success depends almost entirely upon the widespread market acceptance of our OEM customers\u2019 products that incorporate our human interface solutions. Even if our technologies successfully meet our customers' price and performance goals, our sales would decline or fail to develop if our customers do not achieve commercial success in selling their products that incorporate our human interface solutions.\nWe must maintain our relationships with our existing customers, particularly with the leading notebook computer OEMs, and expand our relationships with smartphone and tablet OEMs. Our customers generally do not provide us with firm, long-term volume purchase commitments, opting instead to issue purchase orders that they can cancel, reduce, or delay at any time, subject to certain limitations. In order to meet the expectations of our customers, we must provide innovative human interface solutions on a timely and cost-effective basis. This requires us to match our design and production capacity with customer demand, maintain satisfactory delivery schedules, and meet performance goals. If we are unable to achieve these goals for any reason, our sales may decline or fail to develop, which would result in decreasing revenue.\nIn addition to maintaining and expanding our customer relationships, we must also identify areas of significant growth potential in other markets, establish relationships with OEMs in those markets, and assist those OEMs in developing products that incorporate our human interface product solutions. Our failure to identify potential growth opportunities, particularly in the smartphone and the tablet market, the PC product applications market, or establish and maintain relationships with OEMs in those markets, would prevent our business from growing in those markets.\nA significant portion of our sales comes from one or more large customers, the loss of which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nHistorically, we have relied on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our total revenue. If we lost key customers, or if key customers reduced or stopped placing orders for our high-volume products, our financial results could be adversely affected. Sales to Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and its affiliates, Sanshin Electronics Co., Ltd., and Fuhrmeister Electronics Co., Ltd. accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue in fiscal 2016. Significant reductions in sales to our largest customers, the loss of other major customers, or a general decrease in demand for our products within a short period of time could adversely affect our revenue, financial condition and business.\nWe sell to contract manufacturers that serve our OEM customers. Any material delay, cancellation, or reduction of orders from any one or more of these contract manufacturers or the OEMs they serve could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. The adverse effect would be more substantial if our other customers do not increase their orders or if we are unsuccessful in generating orders for our solutions from new customers. Many of these contract manufacturers sell to the same OEMs, and therefore our concentration with certain OEMs may be higher than with any individual contract manufacturer. Concentration in our customer base may make fluctuations in revenue and earnings more severe and make business planning more difficult.\nWe depend on third parties to maintain satisfactory manufacturing yields and delivery schedules, and their inability to do so could increase our costs, disrupt our supply chain, and result in our inability to deliver our products, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe depend on our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to maintain high levels of productivity and satisfactory delivery schedules at manufacturing and assembly facilities located primarily in China, Taiwan, and Thailand. We provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts of our production requirements. We do not, however, have long-term agreements with our contract manufacturers that guarantee production capacity, prices, lead times,\nor delivery schedules. On occasion, customers require rapid increases in production, which can strain our resources and reduce our margins. Although we have been able to obtain increased production capacity from our third-party contract manufacturers in the past, there is no guarantee that our contract manufacturers will be able to increase production capacity to meet customer demands in the future. Our contract manufacturers also serve other customers, a number of which have greater production requirements than we do. As a result, our contract manufacturers could determine to prioritize production capacity for other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice. Qualifying new contract manufacturers, and specifically semiconductor foundries, is time consuming and might result in unforeseen manufacturing and operations problems. We may also encounter lower manufacturing yields and longer delivery schedules in commencing volume production of new products that we introduce, which could increase our costs or disrupt our supply of such products. The loss of relationships with our contract manufacturers or assemblers, or their inability to conduct their manufacturing and assembly services for us as anticipated in terms of capacity, cost, quality, and timeliness could adversely affect our ability to fill customer orders in accordance with required delivery, quality, and performance requirements, and adversely affect our operating results.\nShortages of components and materials may delay or reduce our sales and increase our costs, thereby harming our operating results.\nThe inability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and other materials necessary for the production of our products could result in reduced or delayed sales or lost orders. Many of the materials used in the production of our products are available only from a limited number of foreign suppliers, particularly suppliers located in Asia. In most cases, neither we nor our contract manufacturers have long-term supply contracts with these suppliers. As a result, we are subject to increased costs, supply interruptions, and difficulties in obtaining materials. Our customers also may encounter difficulties or increased costs in obtaining the materials necessary to produce their products into which our product solutions are incorporated. Future shortages of materials and components, including potential supply constraints of silicon, could cause delayed shipments and customer dissatisfaction, which may result in lower revenue.\nWe are subject to lengthy development periods and product acceptance cycles, which can result in development and engineering costs without any future revenue.\nWe provide human interface solutions that are incorporated by OEMs into the products they sell. OEMs make the determination during their product development programs whether to incorporate our solutions or pursue other alternatives. This process requires us to make significant investments of time and resources in the design of human interface solutions well before our customers introduce their products incorporating these interfaces, and before we can be sure that we will generate any significant sales to our customers or even recover our investment. During a customer\u2019s entire product development process, we face the risk that our interfaces will fail to meet our customer\u2019s technical, performance, or cost requirements, or that our products will be replaced by competitive products or alternative technological solutions. Even if we complete our design process in a manner satisfactory to our customer, the customer may delay or terminate its product development efforts. The occurrence of any of these events could cause sales to not materialize, be deferred, or be cancelled, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe face intense competition that could result in our losing or failing to gain market share and suffering reduced revenue.\nWe serve intensely competitive markets that are characterized by price erosion, rapid technological change, and competition from major domestic and international companies. This intense competition could result in pricing pressures, lower sales, reduced margins, and lower market share. Depressed economic conditions, a slowdown in the PC or mobile product applications markets, the emergence of new products not including our product solutions, rapid changes in the smartphone market and competitive pressures may result in lower demand for our product solutions and reduced unit margins.\nAny movement away from high-quality, custom designed, feature-rich human interface solutions to lower priced alternatives would adversely affect our business. Some of our competitors, particularly in the markets for mobile product applications and other electronic devices, have greater market recognition, larger customer bases, and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources than we possess and that afford them greater competitive advantages. As a result, they may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of products, negotiate lower prices for raw materials and components, deliver competitive products at lower prices, and introduce new product solutions and respond to customer requirements more quickly than we can. Our competitive position could suffer if one or more of our customers determine not to utilize our custom engineered, total solutions approach and instead, decide to design and manufacture their own interfaces, contract with our competitors, or use alternative technologies.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, both within and outside our control. These factors include the following:\n\u00b7\nour success in designing and introducing new human interface solutions, including those implementing new technologies;\n\u00b7\nour ability to predict the evolving needs of our customers and to assist them in incorporating our technologies into their new and existing products;\n\u00b7\nour ability to meet our customers\u2019 requirements for low power consumption, ease of use, reliability, durability, and small form factor;\n\u00b7\nour ability to meet our customers\u2019 price and performance requirements;\n\u00b7\nthe quality of our customer service and support;\n\u00b7\nthe rate at which customers incorporate our human interface solutions into their own products;\n\u00b7\nproduct or technology introductions by our competitors; and\n\u00b7\nforeign currency fluctuations, which may cause a foreign competitor\u2019s products to be priced significantly lower than our product solutions.\nIf we do not keep pace with technological innovations, our products may not remain competitive and our revenue and operating results may suffer.\nWe operate in rapidly changing highly competitive markets. Technological advances, the introduction of new products and new design techniques could adversely affect our business unless we are able to adapt to changing conditions. Technological advances could render our solutions less competitive or obsolete, and we may not be able to respond effectively to the technological requirements of evolving markets. Therefore, we will be required to expend substantial funds for and commit significant resources to enhancing and developing new technology which may include purchasing advanced design tools and test equipment, hiring additional highly qualified engineering and other technical personnel, and continuing and expanding research and development activities on existing and potential human interface solutions.\nOur research and development efforts with respect to new technologies may not result in customer or market acceptance. Some or all of those technologies may not successfully make the transition from the research and development stage to cost-effective production as a result of technology problems, competitive cost issues, yield problems, and other factors. Even if we successfully complete a research and development effort with respect to a particular technology, our customers may decide not to introduce or may terminate products utilizing the technology for a variety of reasons, including difficulties with other suppliers of components for the products, superior technologies developed by our competitors and unfavorable comparisons of our solutions with these technologies, price considerations and lack of anticipated or actual market demand for the products.\nOur business could be harmed if we are unable to develop and utilize new technologies that address the needs of our customers, or our competitors or customers develop and utilize new technologies more effectively or more quickly than we can. Any investments made to enhance or develop new technologies that are not successful could have an adverse effect on our net revenue and operating results.\nWe may not be able to enhance our existing product solutions and develop new product solutions in a timely manner.\nOur future operating results will depend to a significant extent on our ability to continue to provide new human interface solutions that compare favorably with alternative solutions on the basis of time to introduction, cost, performance, and end user preferences. Our success in maintaining existing customers and attracting new customers, and developing new business depends on various factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\ninnovative development of new solutions for customer products;\n\u00b7\nutilization of advances in technology;\n\u00b7\nmaintenance of quality standards;\n\u00b7\nperformance advantages;\n\u00b7\nefficient and cost-effective solutions; and\n\u00b7\ntimely completion of the design and introduction of new human interface solutions.\nOur inability to enhance our existing product solutions and develop new product solutions on a timely basis could harm our operating results and impede our growth.\nAdditionally, our human interface solutions are designed to integrate touch, handwriting, and vision capabilities. New computing and communications devices could be developed that call for a different interface solution. Existing devices could also be modified to allow for a different interface solution. Our business could be harmed if our products become noncompetitive as a result of a technological breakthrough that allows a new interface solution to displace our solutions and achieve significant market acceptance.\nInternational sales and manufacturing risks could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur manufacturing and assembly operations are primarily conducted in China, Taiwan, and Thailand by contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators. We have sales and logistics operations in Hong Kong, and sales and engineering design support operations in Armenia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, and Taiwan. These international operations expose us to various economic, political, and other risks that could adversely affect our operations and operating results, including the following:\n\u00b7\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing a multinational organization;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\ndiffering labor regulations;\n\u00b7\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u00b7\ntariffs, duties and other trade barrier restrictions;\n\u00b7\nchanges to export or import compliance laws;\n\u00b7\npossible employee turnover or labor unrest;\n\u00b7\ngreater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7\nthe burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws;\n\u00b7\nthe volatility of currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\npotentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\npolitical or economic instability in certain parts of the world; and\n\u00b7\nnatural disasters, including earthquakes or tsunamis.\nIf any of these risks associated with international operations materialize, our operations could be disrupted, which would negatively affect our operating results.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies.\nWe transact business predominantly in U.S. dollars, and we invoice and collect our sales in U.S. dollars. A weakening of the U.S. dollar could cause our overseas vendors to require renegotiation of either the prices or currency we pay for their goods and services. In the future, customers may negotiate pricing and make payments in non-U.S. currencies. For fiscal 2016, approximately 10% of our costs were denominated in non-U.S. currencies, including Armenian dram, Canadian dollars, European Union euro, Hong Kong dollars, Indian rupee, New Taiwan dollars, Japanese yen, Korean won, Chinese yuan, and Swiss francs.\nIf our overseas vendors or customers require us to transact business in non-U.S. currencies, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our cost of goods, operating expenses, and operating margins, and could result in exchange losses. In addition, currency devaluation could result in a loss to us if we hold deposits of that currency. Hedging foreign currencies can be difficult, especially if the currency is not freely traded. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our infrastructure, management, and resources could be strained, our ability to effectively manage our business could be diminished, and our operating results could suffer.\nThe failure to manage our planned growth effectively could strain our resources, which would impede our ability to increase revenue. We have increased the number of our human interface solutions and plan to further expand the number and diversity of our solutions and their use in the future. Our ability to manage our planned diversification and growth effectively will require us to:\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully hire, train, retain, and motivate additional employees, including employees outside the United States;\n\u00b7\nefficiently plan and expand our facilities to meet increased headcount requirements;\n\u00b7\nenhance our global operational, financial, and management infrastructure; and\n\u00b7\nexpand our development and production capacity.\nIn connection with the expansion and diversification of our product and customer base, we may increase our personnel and make other expenditures to meet demand for our expanding product offerings, including offerings in the mobile product applications market and the notebook computer market. Any increase in expenses or investments in infrastructure and facilities in anticipation of future orders that do not materialize would adversely affect our profitability. Our customers also may require rapid increases in design and production services that place an excessive short-term burden on our resources and the resources of our contract manufacturers. An inability to quickly expand our development, design or production capacity or an inability of our third-party manufacturers to quickly expand development, design or production capacity to meet this customer demand could result in a decrease to our revenue or operating results. If we cannot manage our growth effectively, our business and operating results could suffer.\nWe depend on key personnel who would be difficult to replace, and our business will likely be harmed if we lose their services or cannot hire additional qualified personnel.\nOur success depends substantially on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key personnel. The competition for qualified management and key personnel, especially engineers, is intense. Although we maintain noncompetition and nondisclosure covenants with most of our key personnel, and our key executives have change of control severance agreements, we do not have employment agreements with many of them. The loss of services of one or more of our key employees or the inability to hire, train, and retain key personnel, especially engineers and technical support personnel, and capable sales and customer-support employees outside the United States, could delay the development and sale of our products, disrupt our business, and interfere with our ability to execute our business plan.\nOur ability to compete successfully and continue growing as a company depends on our ability to adequately protect our proprietary technology and confidential information.\nWe protect our proprietary technology and confidential information through the use of patents, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions. The process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive. Further, there can be no assurance that even if a patent is issued, that it will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that the rights granted under the patents will provide us with meaningful protection or any commercial advantage.\nWe have not applied for, and do not have, any copyright registration on our technologies or products. We have applied to register certain of our trademarks in the United States and other countries. There can be no assurance that we will obtain registrations of principal or other trademarks in key markets. Failure to obtain registrations could compromise our ability to fully protect our trademarks and brands, and could increase the risk of challenge from third parties to our use of our trademarks and brands. Effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries in which we operate. In particular, the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property in China, where we derive a significant portion of our net sales, and certain other countries where we derive net sales, are still evolving and historically, have not protected and may not protect in the future, intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws developed in the United States.\nWe do not consistently rely on written agreements with our customers, suppliers, manufacturers, and other recipients of our technologies and products and therefore, some trade secret protection may be lost and our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited. Confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements which are in place may not be adequate to protect our proprietary technologies or may be breached by other parties. Additionally, our customers, suppliers, manufacturers, and other recipients of our technologies and products may seek to use our technologies and products without appropriate limitations. In the past, we did not consistently require our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality, employment, or proprietary information and invention assignment agreements. Therefore, our former employees and consultants may try to claim some ownership interest in our technologies and products, or may use our technologies and products competitively and without appropriate limitations. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise use aspects of our technologies and products that we regard as proprietary. Other companies, including our competitors, may independently develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate our technologies, or design around our patents. If our intellectual property protection is insufficient to protect our intellectual property rights, we could face increased competition in the markets for our technologies and products.\nWe may pursue, and are currently defending litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. These litigations, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nAny claims that our technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties could result in significant costs and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other third party proprietary rights. Any claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of resources, including the attention of management, and could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that such licenses could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or that the terms of any offered licenses would be acceptable to us. We may also have to pay substantial damages to third parties, or indemnify customers or licensees for damages they suffer if the products they purchase from us or the technology they license from us violates any third party intellectual property rights. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or a failure to obtain necessary licenses to use such third-party technology could prevent us from manufacturing, using, or selling certain of our products, and there is no guarantee that we will able to develop or acquire alternate non-infringing technology.\nIn addition, we license certain technology used in and for our products from third parties. These third-party licenses are granted with restrictions, and there can be no assurances that such third-party technology will remain available to us on commercially acceptable terms.\nIf third-party technology currently utilized in our products is no longer available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or if any third party initiates litigation against us for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, we may not be able to sell certain of our products and we could incur significant costs in defending against litigation or attempting to develop or acquire alternate non-infringing products, which would have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf we become subject to product returns or claims resulting from defects in our products, we may incur significant costs resulting in a decrease in revenue.\nWe develop complex products in an evolving marketplace and generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of delivery. Despite testing by us and our customers, defects may be found in existing or new products. Manufacturing errors or product defects could result in a delay in recognition or loss of revenue, loss of market share, or failure to achieve market acceptance. Additionally, defects could result in financial or other damages to our customers, causing us to incur significant warranty, support, and repair costs, and diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from key product development efforts.\nAny acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and harm our operating results.\nWe expect to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire other businesses and technologies in order to complement our current human interface solutions, expand the breadth of our markets, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise create growth opportunities. We cannot accurately predict the timing, size, and success of any future acquisitions. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to complete the acquisitions of candidates that we identify. Increased competition for acquisition candidates or increased asking prices by acquisition candidates may increase purchase prices for acquisitions to levels beyond our financial capability or to levels that would not result in the returns required by our acquisition criteria. Acquisitions may also become more difficult in the future as we or others acquire the most attractive candidates. Unforeseen expenses, difficulties, and delays frequently encountered in connection with rapid expansion through acquisitions could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our operating results. If we make any future acquisitions, we could issue stock that would dilute existing stockholders' percentage ownership, incur substantial debt, assume contingent liabilities, or experience higher operating expenses.\nWe may be unable to effectively complete an integration of the management, operations, facilities, and accounting and information systems of acquired businesses with our own; efficiently manage, combine or restructure the operations of the acquired businesses with our operations; achieve our operating, growth, and performance goals for acquired businesses; achieve additional revenue as a result of our expanded operations; or achieve operating efficiencies or otherwise realize cost savings as a result of anticipated acquisition synergies. The integration of acquired businesses involves numerous risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe potential disruption of our core business;\n\u00b7\nthe potential strain on our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures;\n\u00b7\npotential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated costs associated with the acquisition;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u00b7\nproblems assimilating the purchased operations, technologies, or products;\n\u00b7\nrisks associated with entering markets and businesses in which we have little or no prior experience;\n\u00b7\nfailure of acquired businesses to achieve expected results;\n\u00b7\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u00b7\nfailure to retain key customers, suppliers, or personnel of acquired businesses;\n\u00b7\nthe risk of impairment charges related to potential write-downs of acquired assets; and\n\u00b7\nthe potential inability to create uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies, and information systems.\nWe cannot assure you that we would be successful in overcoming problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions, and our inability to do so could disrupt our operations, result in goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges, and adversely affect our business.\nPotential strategic alliances may not achieve their objectives, and the failure to do so could impede our growth.\nWe have entered, and we anticipate that we will continue to enter, into strategic alliances. We continually explore strategic alliances designed to enhance or complement our technology or to work in conjunction with our technology; to provide necessary know-how, components, or supplies; and to develop, introduce, and distribute products utilizing our technology. Certain strategic alliances may not achieve their intended objectives, and parties to our strategic alliances may not perform as contemplated. The failure of these alliances to achieve their objectives may impede our ability to introduce new products and enter new markets.\nWe must finance the growth of our business and the development of new products, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nTo remain competitive, we must continue to make significant investments in research and development, marketing, and business development. Our failure to sufficiently increase our net revenue to offset these increased costs would adversely affect our operating results.\nFrom time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to provide for funds required to expand our business, including through acquisitions. We cannot predict the timing or amount of any such requirements at this time. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to expand our business or to develop new business at the rate desired and our operating results may suffer. If obtained, the financing itself carries risks including the following: (i) debt financing increases expenses and must be repaid regardless of operating results; and (ii) equity financing, including the issuance of additional shares in connection with acquisitions, could result in dilution to existing stockholders and could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition or operating flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations outstanding under our credit agreement and other indebtedness we may incur from time to time.\nWe incurred a significant amount of indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of Renesas SP Drivers, Inc., or RSP, in fiscal 2015 (we refer to that acquisition herein as the \u201cRSP Acquisition\u201d). We entered into a credit agreement (which we refer to herein, as amended and supplemented, as the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with the lenders party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, or the Administrative Agent, as administrative agent for the Lenders, in connection with the RSP Acquisition. Our current and long-term bank debt incurred in connection with the close of the RSP Acquisition was approximately $250.0 million, and we have $150.0 million of undrawn availability in the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement. As of June 30, 2016, our current and long-term bank debt outstanding is $238.8 million.\nOur level of indebtedness could have important consequences on our future operations, including:\n\u00b7\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment and other obligations under the Credit Agreement or our other outstanding debt from time to time;\n\u00b7\nrisking an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, which could result in all of our bank debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit the lenders under the Credit Agreement to foreclose on the assets securing such debt;\n\u00b7\nsubjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our debt with variable interest rates, including the debt incurred under the Credit Agreement;\n\u00b7\nreducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and\n\u00b7\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us under the Credit Agreement or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nThe covenants in the Credit Agreement impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe Credit Agreement includes certain covenants that limit (subject to certain exceptions) our ability to, among other things: (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; (ii) incur or suffer to exist liens securing indebtedness; (iii) make investments; (iv) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; (v) sell assets; (vi) pay dividends or other distributions on, redeem or repurchase capital stock; (vii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (viii) amend, modify, prepay or redeem subordinated indebtedness; (ix) enter into certain restrictive agreements; (x) engage in a new line of business; and (xi) enter into sale leaseback transactions. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that (i) restrict the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, (ii) require the ratio of the amount of our consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA to be less than certain maximum ratio levels, and (iii) require the ratio of the amount of our consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense to be greater than a certain minimum ratio level.\nIf we violate these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers, our debt under the Credit Agreement would be in default and could be accelerated, and could permit, in the case of secured debt, the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing the Credit Agreement. If the indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our debt is in default for any reason, our cash flows, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting, we may incur significant expenses to remediate internal control deficiencies, lose investor confidence and our share price may decline.\nWe are subject to rules adopted by the SEC, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX, which requires us to include in our quarterly and annual reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K, our management\u2019s report on, and assessment of the effectiveness of, our internal control over financial reporting. We have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, however, we need to maintain our existing processes and systems and adapt such processes and systems as our business grows and changes. This continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with SOX is expensive, time-consuming and requires significant management attention. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain adequate and effective internal controls over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with SOX and SEC rules. Furthermore, as we grow our company or acquire other companies, our internal controls may become more complex and may require significantly more resources to ensure they remain effective. Failure to comply with SOX and SEC rules, including a delay in or failure to successfully integrate new businesses into our internal control over financial reporting, a failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation of such new or improved controls, could harm our operating results or cause us to not meet our reporting obligations. If we or our auditors identify material weaknesses in our internal controls, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, may cause investors to lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements and the trading price of our common stock may decline. Remediation of a material weakness could require us to incur significant expense and expend significant management attention. Failure to remedy any material weakness could result in inaccurate financial statements, an inability for the company to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis, a loss in investor confidence, decline in the trading price of our common stock, restriction on access to worldwide capital markets, and sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, including the SEC or The Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nWe expect to incur additional expenses in complying with corporate governance and public disclosure requirements.\nChanging laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including SEC regulations and Nasdaq Global Select Market rules, create uncertainty and increased expenses for companies such as ours. New or changed laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. We expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of significant resources.\nDuring the third quarter of calendar year 2012, the SEC adopted rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or Dodd-Frank. These rules impose diligence and disclosure requirements regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. Compliance with these rules results in additional costs and expenses, including costs and expenses incurred for due diligence to determine and verify the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, and remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification efforts. These rules may also affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our products as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d minerals that can be used in our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such minerals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.\nRepatriation of our foreign earnings to the United States or changes in tax laws may adversely affect our future reported tax rates and financial results or the way we conduct our business.\nWe consider the undistributed operating earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, which totaled approximately $680.9 million as of the end of fiscal 2016, to be indefinitely invested outside the United States and have not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed operating earnings. Proposals to reform U.S. tax laws, including proposals that could reduce or eliminate the deferral of U.S. income tax on our foreign subsidiaries\u2019 undistributed earnings, could require those earnings to be taxed at the U.S. federal income tax rate. If we do need to access our foreign subsidiaries\u2019 undistributed earnings for our domestic operations, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds, which would adversely impact our financial position and results of operations. Additionally, if changes to tax laws or Tax Court decisions invalidate existing tax laws or regulations upon which we have relied, this could adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.\nIf tax laws change in the jurisdictions in which we do business or if we receive a material tax assessment in connection with an examination of our income tax returns, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we do business. Our future effective tax rates and the value of our deferred tax assets could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws in those jurisdictions. In addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we do business. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of highly complex tax laws. Our results have in the past, and could in the future, include favorable and unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period a determination of such estimated tax liability is made or resolved, upon the filing of an amended return, upon a change in facts, circumstances, or interpretation, or upon the expiration of a statute of limitation. While we believe we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes in connection with the resolution of income tax uncertainties, the resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, result of operations, or cash flows.\nWe face risks associated with security breaches or cyber attacks.\nWe face risks associated with security breaches or cyber attacks of our computer systems or those of our third-party representatives, vendors, and service providers. Although we have implemented security procedures and controls to address these threats, our systems may still be vulnerable to data theft, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties, or similar disruptive problems. If our systems, or systems owned by third parties affiliated with our company, were breached or attacked, the proprietary and confidential information of our company and our customers could be disclosed and we may be required to incur substantial costs and liabilities, including the following: liability for stolen assets or information; costs of repairing damage to our systems; lost revenue and income resulting from any system downtime caused by such breach or attack; loss of competitive advantage if our proprietary information is obtained by competitors as a result of such breach or attack; increased costs of cyber security protection; costs of incentives we may be required to offer to our customers or business partners to retain their business; damage to our reputation; and expenses to rectify the consequences of the security breach or cyber attack. In addition, any compromise of security from a security breach or cyber attack could deter customers or business partners from entering into transactions that involve providing confidential information to us. As a result, any compromise to the security of our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn the future, if we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of additional shares for our share-based compensation award programs, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel or may be required to increase the cash element of our compensation program.\nCompetition for qualified personnel in our industry is extremely intense, particularly for engineering and other technical personnel. Our compensation program, which includes cash and share-based compensation award components, has been instrumental in attracting, hiring, motivating, and retaining qualified personnel. Our success depends on our continued ability to use our share-based compensation programs to effectively compete for engineering and other technical personnel and professional talent without significantly increasing cash compensation costs. In the future, if we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of additional shares for our share-based compensation award programs, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel or we may be required to increase the cash elements of our compensation program to account for this disadvantage.\nThe accounting requirements for income taxes on certain of our share-based compensation awards may subject our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates to volatility.\nWe recognize a tax benefit upon expensing nonqualified stock options and deferred stock units, or DSUs, issued under our share-based compensation plans. However, under current accounting standards, we cannot recognize that tax benefit concurrent with expensing incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares (qualified stock options) issued under our share-based compensation plans. For qualified stock options that vested after our adoption of the applicable accounting standards, we recognize the tax benefit only in the period when disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock occur and, for qualified stock options that vested prior to our adoption of the applicable accounting standards, the tax benefit is recorded directly to additional paid-in capital. Accordingly, because we cannot recognize the tax benefit for share-based compensation expense associated with qualified stock options until the occurrence of future disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock, such disqualified dispositions may happen in periods when our stock price substantially increases, and because a portion of that tax benefit may be directly recorded to additional paid-in capital, our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates may be subject to volatility.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, and discourage a takeover.\nOur certificate of incorporation and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying attempts by others to obtain control of our company, even when such attempts may be in the best interests of our stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to issue one or more series of preferred stock, which could have voting and conversion rights that adversely affect or dilute the voting power of the holders of our common stock. Delaware law also imposes conditions on certain business combination transactions with \u201cinterested stockholders.\u201d Our certificate of incorporation divides our Board of Directors into three classes, with one class to stand for election each year for a three-year term after the election. The classification of directors tends to discourage a third party from initiating a proxy solicitation or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company and may maintain the incumbency of our Board of Directors, as this structure generally increases the difficulty of, or may delay, replacing a majority of directors. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to fill vacancies or newly created directorships. A majority of the directors then in office may elect a successor to fill any vacancies or newly created directorships, thereby increasing the difficulty of, or delaying a third party\u2019s efforts in, replacing a majority of directors.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nvariations in our quarterly results;\n\u00b7\nthe financial guidance we may provide to the public, any changes in such guidance, or our failure to meet such guidance;\n\u00b7\nchanges in financial estimates by industry or securities analysts or our failure to meet such estimates;\n\u00b7\nvarious market factors or perceived market factors, including rumors, whether or not correct, involving us, our customers, our suppliers, or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of technological innovations by us, our competitors, or our customers;\n\u00b7\nintroductions of new products or new pricing policies by us, our competitors, or our customers;\n\u00b7\nacquisitions or strategic alliances by us, or our competitors, or our customers;\n\u00b7\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe gain or loss of significant orders;\n\u00b7\nthe gain or loss of significant customers;\n\u00b7\nmarket conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers, and the economy as a whole;\n\u00b7\nshort positions held by investors;\n\u00b7\nnew federal and state laws and regulations affecting our industry; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral financial market conditions or occurrences, including market volatility resulting from geopolitical risks, acts of war, terrorist attacks, cybersecurity attacks, financial market technological glitches and interruptions of trading activity.\nIn addition, stocks of technology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to these companies\u2019 operating performance. Public announcements by technology companies concerning, among other things, their performance, accounting practices, or legal problems could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance.", "PERMNO": 89290, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "SYNA"}
