{"cik": "1123316", "company": "Crystal Rock Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-01-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nWe operate in a competitive business environment that is influenced by conditions some of which are controllable and others are beyond our control. These conditions include, but are not limited to, the regional economy, monetary policy, and the political and regulatory environment. The following summarizes important risks and uncertainties that may materially affect our business in the future.\nThe Baker family currently owns a majority of our voting stock and controls the company. Such control affects our corporate governance, and could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the company.\nThe Baker family group, consisting of former director Henry Baker and three current directors Peter Baker (CEO), John Baker (Executive Vice President) and Ross Rapaport (Chairman), as trustee, together own a majority of our common stock. Accordingly, these stockholders, acting together, can exert a controlling influence over the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, such as the election of directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation, mergers and various other matters. The concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the company.\nAs permitted under the corporate governance rules of the NYSE MKT, we have, at the direction of the Baker family group, elected \u201ccontrolled company\u201d status under those rules. A controlled company is exempted from these NYSE MKT corporate governance rules: (1) the requirement that a listed company have a majority of independent directors, (2) the requirement that nominations to the company\u2019s board of directors be either selected or recommended by a nominating committee consisting solely of independent directors, and (3) the requirement that officers\u2019 compensation be either determined or recommended by a compensation committee consisting solely of independent directors. We do not currently utilize exemption (3) as we have a compensation committee consisting solely of three independent directors.\nThe personal interests of our directors and officers create conflicts.\nAs mentioned above, the Baker family group owns a majority of our common stock. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of the Crystal Rock Spring Water Company in 2000, we issued members of the Baker family group 12% subordinated promissory notes secured by all of our assets. As of October 31, 2014, the balance on these notes is $10,000,000. We also lease important facilities in Watertown and Stamford, Connecticut from Baker family interests. These interests of the Baker family create various conflicts of interest. Transactions between the Company and related parties are subject to review and approval by the Audit Committee, which consists entirely of independent directors.\nOur office products business is significantly different from our traditional business and accordingly presents us with new challenges. Integrating the office products business with our legacy business has been difficult in certain respects. Moreover, profit margins on products in this line are lower than profit margins in our water and office refreshment business. These factors have resulted in some operating inefficiencies and have negatively affected our earnings and cash flow. We are working to resolve these issues, but there is no assurance that we can manage the necessary changes in an optimal way so as to increase revenues and net income, and improve our cash flow.\nIn 2011, we began to distribute office products under the Crystal Rock Office\u00ae brand and commenced a hiring effort to increase our sales force substantially. Initial sales were relatively modest. In 2013, we acquired an office products business in our market area that had higher annual sales in that line of business than we did. This acquisition resulted in significantly improved revenues, but maintaining gross margins on our office products has been challenging. In addition, we must address compatibility issues between our legacy software and software we obtained in the office products business acquisition described above. Other integration issues related to the 2013 acquisition include managing route delivery systems so that the greater cost of overnight deliveries and deliveries outside our regular distribution routes will not adversely affect total delivery costs and thereby diminish margins on our office products. We continue to work to enhance our e-commerce system and to facilitate the distribution integration of our traditional product lines with office products.\nThere can be no assurance that we can manage the growth and expansion of our office products business in an optimal way so as to increase revenues while maintaining acceptable gross margins and improving our net income and cash flow. If we are unable to achieve this growth, or if we have difficulties integrating our office products business with our legacy business, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe office products business is highly competitive. Many of our competitors are larger and better capitalized than we are. In addition, the evolution of modern business practices towards the \u201cpaperless office\u201d may tend to reduce the available market for some office products. If we are unable to compete successfully in this market, our office products business may be harmed and our revenues and profits may be materially and adversely affected.\nCompetition in this area is robust. Companies like Staples, Office Max, Office Depot and W.B. Mason are larger and better capitalized than Crystal Rock and compete with us on price as well as level of service. Further, if the overall market for office products contracts, price competition can be expected to exert pressure on our margins for office products, with potential adverse effects on our earnings or cash flow, even if we are able to continue increasing revenues from this product line. There can be no assurance that we can continue to increase revenues from office products. Even if we do increase such revenues, there can be no assurance that gross margins and profits from this product line will be adequate to support this part of our business as we endeavor to expand it.\nAcquisitions may disrupt our operations or adversely affect our results.\nWe regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire other businesses. The expenses we incur evaluating and pursuing acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If we acquire a business, we may be unable to manage it profitably or successfully integrate its operations with our own. Moreover, we may be unable to realize the financial, operational, and other benefits we anticipate from these acquisitions. Competition for future acquisition opportunities in our markets could increase the price we pay for businesses we acquire and could reduce the number of potential acquisition targets. Further, acquisitions may involve a number of special financial and business risks, such as:\n\u00b7\ncharges related to any potential acquisition from which we may withdraw;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of our management\u2019s time, attention, and resources;\n\u00b7\ndecreased utilization during the integration process;\n\u00b7\nintegration into our business of new personnel, or loss of key acquired personnel;\n\u00b7\nincreased costs to improve or coordinate managerial, operational, financial, and administrative systems, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u00b7\ndilutive issuances of equity securities, including convertible debt securities;\n\u00b7\nthe assumption of legal liabilities;\n\u00b7\namortization of acquired intangible assets;\n\u00b7\npotential write-offs related to the impairment of goodwill;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in integrating diverse corporate cultures; and\n\u00b7\nadditional conflicts of interest.\nWe also face significant competition in the water and office refreshment business from companies with greater resources than we have. Methods of competition in the distribution of home and office refreshment products continue to change and evolve. If we are unable to meet these changes, our business could be harmed.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets in the water and refreshment businesses. The principal methods of competition in the markets in which we compete are distribution capabilities, brand recognition, quality, reputation, and price. We have a significant number of competitors in our traditional water market, some of which have far greater resources than us. Among our principal competitors are Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America, large regional brands owned by private groups, and local competitors in the markets that we serve. As we have expanded our product lines, most notably single serve coffee, we have become competitive with other businesses. These include large national and regional office supply companies and retail store chains. Price reductions and the introduction of new products by our competitors can adversely affect our revenues, gross margins, and profits.\nOur industry has also been affected by the increasing availability of water coolers in discount retail outlets. This has negatively affected our rental revenue stream in recent years as more customers choose to purchase coolers rather than rent them. The reduction of rental revenue has been somewhat offset by the increase in coolers that we sell, although not to the extent that rentals have declined. We do not expect retail sales to replace rentals completely because we believe that the purchase option does not provide the quality and service that many customers want. However, third party retail cooler sales may continue to negatively impact our rental revenues in the future.\nWe rely upon a single software vendor that supplies the software for our route accounting system, which exposes us to risk from interruption of service. In addition, the vendor that supports the software for our online storefront ordering system is ending support for this system, which could render our online portal less effective or ineffective if we do not efficiently execute the transition to other software or other methods of support.\nOur route accounting system is essential to our overall administrative function and success. An extended interruption in servicing the system could result in the inability to access information. Limited or no access to this information would likely inhibit the distribution of our products and the availability of management information, and could even affect our compliance with public reporting requirements. Our software vendor has a limited number of staff possessing the proprietary information pertaining to the operation of the software. Changes in personnel or ownership in the firm might result in disruption of service. Such changes would be addressed by retaining a new vendor to service the existing software or purchasing a new system. However, any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition.\nOur portal for customer online orders, which are primarily for the purchase of office supplies, is vital to our sales operations and integrates with our primary supplier to facilitate next day delivery. The vendor that developed and supports this software recently has announced that it will no longer support the current software we use for this system. We are considering alternative methods to support or replace this software, including internal programming, third party support, or new software. While this transition provides us an opportunity to enhance our online ordering, our business could be adversely affected, our expenses increased, or our online portal rendered less effective or ineffective if we do not execute the transition efficiently.\nWe depend upon maintaining the integrity of our water sources and manufacturing process. If our water sources or bottling processes were contaminated for any reason, our business would be seriously harmed.\nOur ability to retain customers and the goodwill associated with our brands is dependent upon our ability to maintain the integrity of our water resources and to guard against defects in, or tampering with, our manufacturing process. The loss of integrity in our water sources or manufacturing process could lead to product recalls and/or customer illnesses that could materially adversely affect our goodwill, market share and revenues. Because we rely upon natural spring sites for sourcing some of our water supply, acts of God, such as earthquakes, could alter the geologic formation of the spring sites, constricting or even contaminating water flow.\nIn addition, we do not own any of our water sources. Although we believe the long term rights to our spring and municipal sources are well secured, any dispute over these rights that resulted in prolonged disruption in supply could cause an increase in cost of our product or shortages that would not allow us to meet the market demand for our product.\nThe bottled water industry is regulated at both the state and federal level. If we are unable to continue to comply with applicable regulations and standards in any jurisdiction, we might not be able to sell our products in that jurisdiction, and our business could be seriously harmed.\nThe FDA regulates bottled water as a food. Our bottled water must meet FDA requirements of safety for human consumption, labeling, processing and distribution under sanitary conditions and production in accordance with FDA \u201cgood manufacturing practices.\u201d In addition, all drinking water must meet Environmental Protection Agency standards established under the Safe Drinking Water Act for mineral and chemical concentration and drinking water quality and treatment, which are enforced by the FDA. We also must meet state regulations in a variety of areas. These regulations set standards for approved water sources and the information that must be provided and the basis on which any therapeutic claims for water may be made. We have received approval for our drinking water in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. However, we can give no assurance that we will receive such approvals in the future.\nLegislative and executive action in state and local governments banning the use of municipal funds for purchasing bottled water, enacting local taxes on bottled water or water extraction, and restricting water withdrawal and usage rights from public and private sources could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nRecent initiatives have taken place in several major cities regarding bottled water, principally the smaller sizes sold in stores to retail consumers. Regulations have been proposed in some localities that would ban the use of public funds to purchase bottled water, enact local taxes on bottled water or water extraction, and restrict the withdrawal of water from public and private sources. These actions are purportedly designed to discourage the use of bottled water due in large part to concerns about the environmental effects of producing and discarding large numbers of plastic bottles. In developing these stories, local and national media have reported on the growth of the bottled water industry and on the pros and cons of consuming bottled water as it relates to solid waste disposal and energy consumption in manufacturing, as well as conserving the supply of water available to the public.\nWe believe that the adverse publicity associated with these reports is generally aimed at the retail, small bottle segment of the industry that is now a minimal part of our business, and that our customers can readily distinguish our products from the retail bottles that are currently the basis for concern in some areas. Our customers typically buy their water in reusable five-gallon containers that are placed on coolers and reused many times. Only approximately 4% of our total sales is from water sold in single serve packages. In addition, we continue to take steps to \u201cgreen\u201d our business by means of solar electricity generation, high efficiency lighting, no-idling and other driving policies, and the use of biodiesel.\nWhile we believe that to date we have not directly experienced any adverse effects from these concerns, and that our products are sufficiently different from those under scrutiny, there is no assurance that adverse publicity about any element of the bottled water industry will not affect consumer behavior by discouraging buyers from buying bottled water products generally. In that case, our sales and other financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur Company is significantly leveraged. Over the years, we have borrowed substantial amounts of money to finance acquisitions. If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations to our senior and subordinated lenders, we would be in default under those obligations, and that could hurt our business or even result in foreclosure, reorganization or bankruptcy.\nAt October 31, 2014 and 2013, our outstanding senior debt was $9,072,000 and $10,083,000, respectively, and our outstanding subordinated debt was $10,000,000 on both of those dates. The underlying loans are secured by substantially all of our assets. If we do not repay our indebtedness in a timely fashion, our secured creditors could declare a default and foreclose upon our assets, which would result in harmful disruption to our business, the sale of assets for less than their fully realizable value, and possible bankruptcy. We must generate enough cash flow to service this indebtedness until maturity.\nFluctuations in interest rates could significantly increase our expenses. We will have significant interest expense for the foreseeable future, which in turn may increase or decrease due to interest rate fluctuations. To partially mitigate this risk, we have used swaps to establish fixed interest rates on 75% of our outstanding senior term debt.\nAs a result of our large amount of debt, we may be perceived by banks and other lenders to be highly leveraged and close to our borrowing ceiling. Until we repay some of our debt, our ability to access additional capital may be limited. In turn, that may limit our ability to finance transactions and to grow our business. In addition, our senior credit agreement limits our ability to incur incremental debt without our lender\u2019s permission.\nOur senior credit agreement contains numerous covenants and restrictions that affect how we conduct our business.\nFluctuations in the cost of essential raw materials and commodities, including fuel costs, for the manufacture and delivery of our products could significantly impact our business.\nBottle manufacturers use plastic and other petroleum-based products for the manufacturing of our bottles. Increases in the cost of petroleum will likely have an impact on our bottle costs.\nWe rely on trucking to receive raw materials and transport and deliver our finished products. Consequently, the price of fuel significantly impacts the cost of our products. We purchase our own fuel for our Home and Office delivery and use third parties for transportation of raw materials and finished goods between our warehouses. While volume purchases can help control erratic fuel pricing, market conditions ultimately determine the price. In the past, we have experienced substantial market fluctuation of fuel prices. However, when fuel prices have increased, we have been able to establish a fuel adjustment charge for our customers that covered the incremental rising cost of fuel. When fuel prices have decreased, they have not decreased enough to offset the incremental fuel cost over what we considered our \u201cbase\u201d level for fuel cost. The risk remains that we may not be able to use fuel price adjustments to cover the cost of fuel increases in a volatile market for petroleum products, which could adversely affect our profitability. Further, limitations on the supply or availability of fuel could inhibit our ability to get raw materials and distribute our products, which in turn could have an adverse affect on our business.\nA significant portion of our sales is derived from coffee. The supply and price of coffee may be limited by climate, by international political and economic conditions, and by access to transportation, combined with consumer demand. An increase in the wholesale price of coffee could result in a reduction in our profitability. If our ability to purchase coffee were impaired by a market shortage, our sales might decrease, which would also result in a reduction of profitability.\nOur success depends on the continued services of key personnel.\nOur continued success will depend in large part upon the expertise of our senior management and their ability to execute our strategic planning. Peter Baker, our Chief Executive Officer and President, John Baker, our Executive Vice President, and Bruce MacDonald, our Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, have entered into employment agreements with Crystal Rock Holdings, Inc. These \u201cat will\u201d employment agreements do not prevent these employees from resigning. The departure or loss of any of these executives individually could have an adverse effect on our business and operations and could contribute to disruption of our business while we searched for replacement personnel with appropriate skills.\nWe have a limited amount of bottling capacity. Significant interruptions of our bottling facilities could adversely affect our business.\nWe own three bottling facilities, and also contract with third parties, to bottle our water. If any of these facilities were incapacitated for an extended period of time, we would likely have to relocate production to an alternative facility. The relocation and additional transportation could increase the cost of our products or result in product shortages that would reduce sales. Higher costs and lower sales would reduce profitability.\nOur business has been and may continue to be affected from time to time by extremes of weather, which may adversely affect our business.\nWhile changing weather is a constant in our market area, we have experienced extreme weather events that affected sales in the years in which they occurred and beyond. For example, in late August 2011, Tropical Storm Irene caused considerable, widespread damage in parts of our market area. Flooding and resulting road damage reduced our ability to service customers in Vermont and Northern New York. In addition, our costs increased to access our springs and ship products. Parts of Connecticut and Massachusetts experienced a major snowstorm in late October 2011, shutting off power and reducing access in some parts of those states for more than a week, with resulting service interruptions and operating cost increases in those areas. In late October 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused significant destruction in the coastal Connecticut, New York City, and northern New Jersey portions of our market area. Again, our customer service was interrupted, and we incurred extra costs. In the winter of 2013-2014, several snow and ice storms in our market area forced us to close some of our facilities and stop distributing our products for short periods of time. The effects of extreme weather like these storms are difficult to quantify because of other variables, but in general these disruptions were temporary and without permanent effects on our business. However, the cumulative effect of extremely adverse weather is not favorable to our business.\nOur customer base is located in New England, New York and New Jersey. If there were to be a material decline in the economy in these regions, our business would likely be adversely affected.\nEssentially all of our sales are derived from New England, New York and New Jersey. We believe that the economic recession experienced in these areas, particularly in 2008 and 2009, adversely affected our financial results, and these regions are still experiencing a variety of adverse effects from the recession. Continued adverse effects in the regional economies, or a significant negative change in the economy of any of these regions, changes in consumer spending in these regions, or the entry of new competitors into these regional markets, among other factors, could result in a decrease in our sales and, as a result, reduced profitability.\nOur business is seasonal, which may cause fluctuations in our stock price.\nHistorically, the period from June to September represents the peak period for sales and revenues due to increased consumption of cold beverages during the summer months in our core Northeastern United States markets. Warmer weather in our geographic markets tends to increase water sales, and cooler weather tends to decrease water sales. To the extent that our quarterly results are affected by these patterns, our stock price may fluctuate to reflect them.", "PERMNO": 78216, "SIC": 2086, "TIC": "CRVP"}
