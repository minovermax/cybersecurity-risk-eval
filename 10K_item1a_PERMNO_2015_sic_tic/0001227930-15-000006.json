Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the following information, the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or Annual Report, and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. These risks and uncertainties may be interrelated or co-related, and as a result, the occurrence of one risk might directly affect other risks described below, make them more likely to occur or magnify their impact. Moreover, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Potential Merger with MaxLinear\nFailure to complete, or delays in completing, the potential merger with MaxLinear announced on February 3, 2015 could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our stock price.\nOn February 3, 2015, we entered into an agreement with MaxLinear pursuant to which, if all of the conditions to closing are satisfied or waived, we will merge with a subsidiary of MaxLinear and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of MaxLinear. Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain closing conditions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully consummate the proposed merger as currently contemplated under the Merger Agreement or at all. Risks related to the failure of the proposed merger to be consummated include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nWe would not realize any or all of the potential benefits of the Merger, including any synergies that could result from combining our financial and proprietary resources with those of MaxLinear, which could have a negative effect on our stock price;\n\u2022\nUnder some circumstances, we may be required to pay a termination fee to MaxLinear of $11.65 million or to reimburse MaxLinear for its out-of-pocket expenses up to a cap of $2.5 million;\n\u2022\nWe will remain liable for significant transaction costs, including legal, accounting, financial advisory and other costs relating to the Merger regardless of whether the Merger is consummated;\n\u2022\nThe trading price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price for our stock reflects a market assumption that the acquisition will be completed;\n\u2022\nThe attention of our management may have been diverted to the acquisition rather than to our own operations and the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us;\n\u2022\nThe potential loss of key personnel during the pendency of the acquisition as employees and other service providers may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following completion of the acquisition; and\n\u2022\nUnder the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completing the Merger, which restrictions could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as we otherwise would have done if we were not subject to these restrictions.\nThe occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our stock price.\nUncertainty about the Merger may adversely affect relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees, whether or not the Merger is completed.\nIn response to the announcement of the Merger, our existing or prospective customers or suppliers may:\n\u2022\ndelay, defer or cease purchasing products or services from, or providing products or services to, us or the combined company;\n\u2022\ndelay or defer other decisions concerning us or the combined company; or\n\u2022\notherwise seek to change the terms on which they do business with us or the combined company.\nAny such delays or changes to terms could materially harm our business or, if the Merger is completed, the business of the combined company.\nIn addition, as a result of the Merger, our current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future with us or the combined company. As a result, key employees may depart because of issues relating to such uncertainty or a desire not to remain with MaxLinear following the completion of the Merger.\nLosses of customers, employees or other important strategic relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Such adverse effects could also be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the Merger for any reason, including delays associated with obtaining requisite regulatory approvals or the approvals of our stockholders and/or MaxLinear\u2019s stockholders.\nIf the Merger is consummated, the combined company may not perform as we or the market expects, which could have an adverse effect on the price of MaxLinear stock, which our current stockholders will own following the completion of the Merger.\nEven if the Merger is consummated, the combined company may not perform as we or the market expect. Risks associated with the combined company following the Merger include:\n\u2022\nIf the Merger does not qualify as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, our stockholders may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes;\n\u2022\nIntegrating two businesses is a difficult, expensive, and time-consuming process, and the failure to integrate successfully the businesses of Entropic and MaxLinear in the expected time frame would adversely affect MaxLinear\u2019s future results following completion of the Merger;\n\u2022\nThe Merger will significantly increase the size of MaxLinear\u2019s operations, and if MaxLinear is not able to effectively manage its expanded operations, its stock price may be adversely affected;\n\u2022\nIt is possible that key employees might decide not to remain with MaxLinear after the Merger is completed, and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the resulting entity\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects;\n\u2022\nThe success of the combined company will also depend upon relationships with third parties and pre-existing customers of Entropic and MaxLinear, which relationships may be affected by customer preferences or public attitudes about the Merger. Any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022\nThe stock price of MaxLinear Class A Common Stock after the Merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the shares of Entropic; and\n\u2022\nIf governmental agencies or regulatory bodies impose requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions on the consummation of the proposed Merger, the combined company\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger may be impaired.\nIf any of these events were to occur, the value of the MaxLinear Class A Common Stock received by our stockholders in the Merger would be adversely affected.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage or deter a potential competing acquirer that might be willing to pay more to effect a business combination with us.\nUnless and until the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with it terms, subject to certain specified exceptions, we are not permitted to solicit, initiate, induce or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any alternative transaction proposals from third parties or to engage in discussions or negotiations with third parties regarding any alternative transaction proposals. Such restrictions could discourage or deter a third party that may be willing to pay more than MaxLinear for the outstanding capital stock of Entropic from considering or proposing such an acquisition of Entropic.\nBecause the number of shares of MaxLinear\u2019s Class A Common Stock issuable in the Merger in respect of one share of our common stock is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of changes in the price of either MaxLinear\u2019s Class A Common Stock or our common stock, the market value of the shares of MaxLinear\u2019s Class A Common Stock to be received by our stockholders in connection with the Merger is subject to change prior to the completion of the Merger.\nThe number of shares of MaxLinear\u2019s Class A Common Stock issuable in the Merger in respect of one share of our common stock is fixed such that each share of our common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.2200 of a share of MaxLinear\u2019s Class A Common Stock as well as $1.20 per share in cash in connection with the Merger. No adjustments to this mix of merger consideration will be made based on changes in the price of either MaxLinear\u2019s Class A Common Stock or our common stock or changes in the business or future prospects of MaxLinear or us prior to the completion of the Merger. Changes in stock price, business or future prospects may result from a variety of factors, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, changes in MaxLinear\u2019s or our operations and financial projections, market assessment of the likelihood that the Merger will be completed as anticipated or at all and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are beyond MaxLinear\u2019s or our control.\nAs a result of any such changes in stock price, the market value of the shares of MaxLinear\u2019s Class A Common Stock that our stockholders will receive at the time that the Merger is completed could vary significantly from the value of such shares immediately prior to the public announcement of the Merger.\nLawsuits have been filed challenging the Merger. Any adverse judgment in such lawsuits may prevent the Merger from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe.\nAs described below (see Part I, Item 3, Legal Matters of this Annual Report), Entropic, the members of our board of directors, and MaxLinear are named as defendants in purported stockholder class action lawsuits brought by several individual Entropic stockholders as plaintiffs, challenging the Merger, and seeking, among other things, to enjoin Entropic and the other parties to the Merger Agreement from consummating the Merger on the agreed-upon terms. One of the conditions to the completion of the Merger is that no temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order prohibiting, preventing or otherwise restraining the completion of the Merger shall have been issued by any court of competent jurisdiction and be in effect. Consequently, if any of the plaintiffs is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the parties from completing the Merger on the agreed-upon terms, the injunction may prevent the completion of the Merger in the expected timeframe, or at all.\nWe have obligations under certain circumstances to hold harmless and indemnify each of the defendant directors against judgments, fines, settlements and expenses related to claims against such directors and otherwise to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law and our bylaws and certificate of incorporation. Such obligations may apply to the lawsuits. Our management believes that the allegations in the lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously contest the lawsuits. However, there can be no assurance that we and the other defendants in these lawsuits will be successful in our defenses. An unfavorable outcome in any of the lawsuits could prevent or delay the consummation of the merger, result in substantial costs to Entropic or both.\nThe ability to complete the Merger is subject to the receipt of consents and approvals from government entities, which may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on us or the combined company or could cause either party to abandon the Merger.\nCompletion of the Merger is conditioned upon, among other things, the receipt of certain regulatory and antitrust approvals, including under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. In deciding whether to grant regulatory or antitrust approvals, the relevant governmental entities will consider the effect of the Merger on competition within their relevant jurisdictions. The relevant governmental entities may condition their approval of the Merger on MaxLinear\u2019s or our agreement to various requirements, limitations or costs, or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of MaxLinear\u2019s business following the Merger. If we and MaxLinear agree to these requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions, the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger may be impaired. We cannot provide any assurance that we or MaxLinear will obtain the necessary approvals or that any of the requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions to which we might agree will not have a material adverse effect on MaxLinear following the Merger. In addition, these requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions may result in the delay or abandonment of the Merger.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur restructuring activities may result in operational disruptions, management distractions and other problems which could adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. There can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of our restructuring activities will be achieved.\nIn June 2014, we announced a restructuring of our business and related reduction in employee headcount and closure of several offices in order to streamline our business, increase operating efficiencies and reduce operating expenses. On November 10, 2014, we announced another business restructuring to reduce operating expenses and cease development of new STB SoC products. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in implementing our restructuring initiatives, or that such efforts will not interfere with our ability to achieve our business objectives. For example, our restructuring activities could disrupt our ongoing engineering initiatives, which could adversely affect our ability to introduce new products and to deliver products both on a timely basis and in accordance with customer requirements, the effect of which could delay revenues or result in lost business opportunities. To the extent that we are unable to effectively reallocate employee responsibilities, the reductions in our workforce associated with our restructuring activities may impact our ability to accurately forecast future financial results or deliver on our financial projections. Moreover, reductions in force can be difficult to manage, may cause concerns from current and potential customers, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business which may cause them to delay or curtail doing business with us, may increase the likelihood of key employees leaving the company or make it more difficult to recruit new employees, and may have an adverse impact on our business. Employees whose positions were eliminated in connection with these restructuring activities may seek employment with our competitors, customers or suppliers. Although our employees are required to sign a confidentiality agreement at the time of hire, the confidential nature of certain proprietary information may not be maintained in the course of any such future employment. In addition, the implementation of expense reduction programs may result in the diversion of efforts of our executive management team and other key employees, which could adversely affect our business, and the potential disruptions caused by our restructuring activities may make it more difficult to identify and consummate a strategic transaction or may reduce the value our shareholders could receive in such a transaction.\nOur November 2014 restructuring may have other adverse impacts on portions of our business that were not targeted in the restructuring. For example, in connection with the November restructuring, we are ceasing development of new STB SoC products. One potential consequence is that customers may curtail or stop purchasing our existing STB SoC products and move to alternate suppliers that offer a more complete future STB SoC product roadmap. This may make it difficult to accurately predict future sales of our products or achieve or sustain profitability. We may also be forced to reduce the selling prices of our existing STB SoC products in order to retain customers or win new designs for those products, which would result in reduced revenues and gross margins from our existing STB SoC products. In addition, by stopping the development of future STB SoC products, we will forego potential future revenues in 2016 and beyond that would have been associated with those products had they been successfully commercialized. We will need to replace those prospective future sales with revenue from other sources if we expect to continue to increase our revenue in future years.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain our current personnel and hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully market our solutions could be harmed.\nWe believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, engineering and sales and marketing personnel. There is significant competition for qualified personnel in the markets in which we compete and in the geographical locations in which we operate. Our inability to return to profitability or grow our revenues, or any adverse perception of our company, our products or our financial position, may negatively affect our perceived reputation and make it more difficult or expensive to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. In addition, our efforts to restructure our business, including reductions in our workforce, may add to uncertainty regarding our future business which may make it difficult to attract and retain employees. The potential Merger with MaxLinear and recent changes in our executive management team also add to uncertainty and may make it more difficult to attract or retain employees. We do not have employment agreements with most of our executive or key employees and the unexpected loss of any key employees, including our president and chief executive officer, other members of our senior management or our senior engineering personnel, or an inability to attract additional qualified personnel, including engineers and sales and marketing personnel, could delay the development, introduction and sale of our solutions and our ability to execute our business strategy may suffer. In addition, in the event that there is a loss of any of our key personnel, there is a potential for loss of important knowledge that may delay or negatively impact development or sale of our solutions and our ability to execute on our business strategy. We do not currently have any key person life insurance covering any executive officer or employee.\nWe have had net operating losses for most of the time we have been in existence, had an accumulated deficit of $329.9 million as of December 31, 2014 and we are unable to predict if or when we will return to profitability on a sustained basis.\nWe were incorporated in 2001, did not commence shipping production quantities of our home connectivity, or Connectivity, solutions until December 2004 and while we were profitable on an annual basis from 2010 through 2012, we incurred a net loss in 2013 and 2014. Consequently, any predictions about future performance of our operations going forward may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer history of successfully commercializing our Connectivity solutions and the more recently acquired STB SoC solutions, and of profitable operations. You should not rely on our operating results for any prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future operating performance.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 we generated a net loss of $98.1 million and $66.2 million, respectively, while during the year ended 2012 we generated net income of $4.5 million. While we have some recent history of profitability, we have incurred substantial net losses since our inception. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $329.9 million and we may incur additional operating losses in the future.\nOur ability to return to profitability on an annual basis depends on the extent to which we can increase revenue and control our costs in order to, among other things, counter any unforeseen difficulties, complications, product delays or other unknown factors that may require additional expenditures, or unforeseen difficulties or costs associated with the integration of acquired assets or businesses. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our growth prospects, product development, sales and marketing and other efforts, we are unable to predict the extent of our future losses. If we are unable to achieve adequate growth or adequately control our expenses, we may not return to profitability on an annual basis.\nWe face intense competition and expect competition to increase in the future, with many of our competitors being larger, more established and better capitalized than we are.\nThe markets for our STB SoC and Connectivity solutions are extremely competitive and have been characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, rapid changes in customer requirements, short product life cycles and frequent introduction of next generation and new solutions, as well as competing technologies. This competition could make it more difficult for us to sell our solutions and result in increased pricing pressure, reduced gross profit as a percentage of revenues or gross margins, increased sales and marketing expenses and failure to increase, or the loss of, market share or expected market share. Semiconductor solutions in particular have a history of declining prices driven by customer insistence on lower prices as the cost of production is reduced and as demand falls when competitive products or newer, more advanced, products are introduced. If market prices decrease faster than product costs, our gross margins and operating margins would be adversely affected.\nMoreover, we expect increased competition from other established and emerging companies both domestically and internationally. In particular, we currently face, or in the future expect to face, competition from companies such as Broadcom Corporation, or Broadcom, STMicroelectronics N.V., or STMicro, Sigma Designs, Inc., MStar Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Qualcomm Incorporated, or Qualcomm, Lantiq Deutschland GmbH and Vixs Systems, Inc., in the sale of MoCA compliant chipsets and technology, and from companies such as Broadcom, NXP Semiconductors N.V., MaxLinear and STMicro, in the sale of direct broadcast satellite outdoor unit, or DBS ODU, products and from companies such as Broadcom, STMicro, MediaTek Inc., MStar Semiconductor, Inc., Sigma Designs, Inc., Marvell, AMlogic, Abilis, Intel, Qualcomm, HiSilicon Technologies and Vixs in the sale of STB SoCs and other STB solutions. Consolidation by industry participants could result in competitors with further increased market share, larger customer bases, greater diversified product offerings and greater technological and marketing expertise, which would allow them to compete more effectively against us. In addition, current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties. If so, competitors or alliances that include our competitors may emerge and could acquire significant market share. Further, our current and potential competitors may also enter into licensing arrangements with third parties with respect to MoCA chipsets or other technology on licensing terms that are more favorable than the licensing terms that we would be able to offer through the direct licensing of our MoCA chipsets and other technology to such third parties. We expect these trends to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in an evolving industry. In addition, our competitors could develop solutions or technologies that cause our solutions and technologies to become non-competitive or obsolete, or cause us to substantially reduce our prices.\nIn addition to direct competitors, we also face competition from a number of established companies that offer products based on competing technologies. For example, our Connectivity products compete with home networking and access products based on other technologies, such as DOCSIS, versions of DSL, Ethernet, HomePNA, HomePlug AV, Broadband over Power Line, High Performance Network Over Coax, Wi-Fi and LTE solutions. Although some of these competing technologies were not originally designed to operate over coaxial cables, our competitors have modified certain technologies, including HomePNA, HomePlug AV, Broadband over Power Line and Wi-Fi, to work on the same in-home coaxial cables that our Connectivity solutions use. We also expect to face competition from companies that offer products based on G.hn technology in the future. Many of our competitors and potential competitors are substantially larger and have longer operating histories, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. Given their capital resources, many of these larger organizations are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in customer purchases or market downturns. Many of our competitors also have broader product lines and market focus, allowing them to bundle their products and services and effectively use other products to subsidize lower prices for those products that compete with ours, or to provide integrated product solutions that offer cost advantages to their customers. In addition, many of our competitors have been in operation much longer than we have and therefore have better name recognition and more long-standing and established relationships with service providers, original design manufacturers, or ODMs, and original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs.\nOur ability to compete depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe adoption of our solutions and technologies by service providers, ODMs and OEMs;\n\u2022\nthe performance and cost effectiveness of our solutions relative to our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nour ability to deliver high quality and reliable solutions in large volumes and on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nour ability to build and maintain close relationships with service providers, ODMs, OEMs, retailers and consumer electronics manufacturers;\n\u2022\nour success in developing and utilizing new technologies to offer solutions and features previously not available in the marketplace that are technologically superior to those offered by our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to identify new and emerging markets and market trends;\n\u2022\nour ability to reduce our product costs and receive favorable pricing from our suppliers;\n\u2022\nour ability to recruit design and application engineers and other technical personnel;\n\u2022\nour ability to protect our intellectual property and obtain licenses to the intellectual property of others on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022\nour ability to transition our customers from older to newer generations of our solutions;\n\u2022\nour ability to expand our market penetration and revenue growth outside of the United States; and\n\u2022\nour ability to create a retail market for our Connectivity solutions in consumer electronics devices, such as televisions.\nOur inability to address any of these factors effectively, alone or in combination with others, could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe depend on a limited number of customers, and ultimately service providers, for a substantial portion of our revenues, and the loss of, or a significant shortfall in, orders from any of these parties could significantly impair our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2014, Wistron NeWeb Corporation, or Wistron, Actiontec Electronics, Inc., Cybertan Companies, MTI Laboratory, Inc. and Foxconn Electronics, Inc., or Foxconn, accounted for approximately 25%, 13%, 11%, 11% and 10% of our net revenues, respectively; for the year ended December 31, 2013, Wistron and Foxconn accounted for approximately 18% and 16% of our net revenues, respectively; and for the year ended December 31, 2012, Wistron and Motorola Mobility Inc., or Motorola, accounted for 21% and 13% of our net revenues, respectively. Our inability to generate anticipated revenues from our key existing or targeted customers, or a significant shortfall in sales to certain of these customers would significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our operating results. Our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on our ability to sell our solutions to our existing and prospective large customers.\nFurther, we depend on a limited number of service providers that purchase products from our customers which incorporate our solutions. Our ability to build and maintain close relationships with service providers is a key factor affecting the deployment and purchase of our solutions. If these service providers, or other service providers that elect to use our solutions, delay, reduce or eliminate purchases of our customers\u2019 products which incorporate our solutions, this would significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, any delayed launch or any sudden or unexpected slowdown in deployments by service providers that incorporate our solutions may lead to an inventory buildup by service providers or by our customers who may, in turn, postpone taking delivery of our solutions or wait to clear their existing inventory before ordering more solutions from us, which, in turn, may adversely affect our results. Our operating results for the foreseeable future will continue to depend on a limited number of service providers\u2019 demand for products which incorporate our solutions.\nWe may have conflicts with our customers or the service providers that purchase products from our customers that incorporate our solutions. Any such conflict could result in events that have a negative impact on our business, including:\n\u2022\nreduced purchases of our solutions or our customers\u2019 products that incorporate them;\n\u2022\nuncertainty regarding ownership of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nlitigation or the threat of litigation; or\n\u2022\nsettlements or other business arrangements imposing obligations on us or restrictions on our business, including obligations to license intellectual property rights or make cash payments.\nIf we fail to develop and introduce new or enhanced solutions on a timely basis, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impaired, and our competitive position may be harmed.\nThe industries in which we compete are volatile and highly competitive. In order to compete effectively, we must continually introduce new products or enhance existing products and accurately anticipate customer requirements for new and upgraded products. The introduction of new products by our competitors, the market acceptance of solutions based on new or alternative technologies, or the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing or future solutions obsolete. Our failure to anticipate or timely develop new or enhanced solutions or technologies in response to technological shifts or changes in customer requirements could result in decreased revenues and an increase in design wins by our competitors.\nNew product development or the enhancement of existing products is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. We may experience difficulties with solution design, manufacturing or certification that could delay or prevent the introduction of new or enhanced solutions. Alternatively, even if technical engineering hurdles can be overcome, we must successfully anticipate customer requirements regarding features and performance, the new or enhanced products must be competitively priced, and they must become available during the window of time when customers are ready to purchase our solutions.\nEven after new or enhanced products are developed, we must be able to successfully bring them to market. The success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, our ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, we cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions, and any failure to manage new product introduction risks could adversely affect our business.\nOur results could be adversely affected if our customers or the service providers who purchase their products are unable to successfully compete in their respective markets. Our results could also be adversely affected due to industry consolidation involving our customers or service providers who buy products from our customers.\nOur customers and the service providers that purchase products from our customers face significant competition from their competitors. We rely on these customers\u2019 and service providers\u2019 ability to develop products and/or services that meet the needs of their customers in terms of functionality, performance, availability and price. If these customers and service providers do not successfully compete, they may lose market share, which would negatively impact the demand for our solutions. For example, for our Connectivity solutions there is intense competition among service providers to deliver video and other multimedia content into and throughout the home. For the sale of our Connectivity solutions, we are currently dependent on the ability of a limited number of service providers to compete in the market for the delivery of high-definition television-quality video, or HD video, and other multimedia content. Therefore, factors influencing the ability of these service providers to compete in this market, such as competition from alternative content providers or laws and regulations regarding local cable franchising or satellite broadcasting rights, could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell Connectivity solutions. In addition, our digital broadcast satellite outdoor unit solutions are primarily supplied to digital broadcast satellite service providers by our ODM and OEM customers. Digital broadcast satellite service providers are facing significant competition from telecommunications carriers and cable service operators as they compete for customers in terms of video, voice and data services. Moreover, ODMs and OEMs who market cable and satellite STBs are competing with a variety of Internet protocol-based video delivery solutions, including versions of DSL technology and certain fiber optic-based solutions. Many of these technologies compete effectively with cable and satellite STBs. If our customers and the service providers who purchase products from our customers that incorporate our solutions do not successfully compete, they may lose market share, which would reduce demand for our solutions.\nBecause we are dependent on a limited number of customers and service providers for the sale of our products, industry consolidation involving our customers and the service providers who buy products from our customers could materially affect our business. For example, AT&T has announced its intention to acquire our largest service-provider end-user customer, DIRECTV. AT&T does not deploy MoCA home networking technology to its video subscribers. If the contemplated Merger is completed, AT&T could require DIRECTV to move away from the use of MoCA, or specifically our MoCA solutions, for home networking. Even if that does not happen, we could see a slowdown in the sale of our products to DIRECTV while the operations of DIRECTV and AT&T are being integrated. As another example, Comcast has announced its intention to acquire Time-Warner Cable. Both Comcast and Time Warner Cable are service-provider end-user customers of ours. However, if this Merger is completed, it is difficult to predict the net impact of such Merger on our sales to the combined entity in the short-term and the long-term.\nIf the market for HD video and other multimedia content delivery solutions does not continue to develop as we anticipate, our revenues may decline or fail to grow, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe derive, and expect to continue to derive for the foreseeable future, a significant portion of our revenues from sales of our Connectivity solutions based on the MoCA standard. The market for multimedia content delivery solutions based on the MoCA standard is relatively new, still evolving and difficult to predict. Currently, the growth of the MoCA-based multimedia content delivery market is largely driven by the adoption and deployment of existing and future generations of the technology by service providers, ODMs and OEMs and, to a lesser extent, by consumer adoption of such technology which is dependent on upgrades from standard definition television services to high-definition television services, or HD services, and on the availability of over-the-top, or OTT, services that directly deliver Internet video content into the home. It is difficult to predict whether the MoCA standard will continue to achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance by service providers or consumers, the rate at which consumers will upgrade to HD services, whether the availability of OTT services will continue to grow or whether consumers beyond the early technology adopters will embrace OTT services in increasing numbers, if at all. Even if MoCA solutions continue to proliferate, it is difficult to anticipate the specifications and features that service providers will require for MoCA-based products purchased for their deployments. Failure to accurately make such predictions may have a material adverse effect on revenue and expense projections. Even if products incorporating our MoCA solutions are ultimately selected by service providers, the timing and speed of deployments of such products by service providers are subject to variables outside of our control which make it difficult to accurately predict revenues for any given period.\nWith regard to Connectivity solutions, some service providers, ODMs and OEMs have adopted, and others may adopt, multimedia content delivery solutions that rely on technologies other than the MoCA standard or may choose to wait for the introduction of products and technologies that serve as a replacement or substitute for, or represent an improvement over, MoCA-based solutions. The alternative technology solutions which compete with MoCA-based solutions include Ethernet, HomePNA, HomePlug AV and Wi-Fi. It is critical to our success that additional service providers, including telecommunications carriers, digital broadcast satellite service providers and cable operators, adopt the MoCA standard for home networking and deploy MoCA solutions to their customers. If the market for MoCA-based solutions does not continue to develop or develops more slowly than we expect, or if we make errors in predicting adoption and deployment rates for these solutions, our revenues may be significantly adversely affected. Our operating results may also be adversely affected by any delays in consumer upgrade to HD services, delays in consumer adoption of OTT services, or if the market for OTT services develops more slowly than we expect.\nMany of these same market dynamics apply to STB SoCs which we acquired when we purchased the STB business from Trident Microsystems, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries, collectively Trident, in 2012. The success of our STB solutions will depend on the adoption and deployment by service providers of the technologies and features offered by our STB SoC products. As with our Connectivity solutions, it is difficult to predict the levels of demand and market acceptance of our STB solutions, and therefore, it may be difficult to predict the timing and amount of future revenues from our STB SoC products.\nEven if service providers, ODMs and OEMs adopt multimedia content delivery solutions based on the MoCA standard, we may not compete successfully in the market for MoCA-compliant chipsets.\nAs a member of MoCA, we are required to license any of our patent claims that are essential to implement the MoCA specifications to other MoCA members on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. As a result, we are required to license some of our important intellectual property to other MoCA members, including other semiconductor manufacturers that may compete with us in the sale of MoCA-compliant chipsets. Furthermore, there may be disagreements among MoCA members as to specifically which of our patent claims we are required to license to them. If we are unable to differentiate our MoCA-compliant chipsets from other MoCA-compliant chipsets by offering superior pricing and features outside MoCA specifications, we may not be able to compete effectively in the market for such chipsets. Moreover, although we are currently and actively involved in the ongoing development of the MoCA standard, we cannot guarantee that future MoCA specifications will incorporate technologies or product features we are developing or that our solutions will be compatible with future MoCA specifications. As additional members, including our competitors, continue to join MoCA, they and existing members may exert greater influence on MoCA and the development of the MoCA standard in a manner that is adverse to our interests. If our Connectivity solutions fail to comply with future MoCA specifications, the demand for these solutions could be severely reduced. Even if our MoCA products offer advanced features and compatibility with evolving MoCA standards, our competitors may offer solutions that integrate their MoCA with other desired functionality, or they may otherwise offer a more a more compelling value proposition to customers than we are able to offer with our limited range of MoCA products.\nThe semiconductor and communications industries are highly cyclical and subject to rapid change and evolving industry standards and, from time to time, have experienced significant downturns in customer demand as well as unexpected increases in demand resulting in production capacity constraints. These factors could impact our operating results, financial condition and cash flows and may increase the volatility of the price of our common stock.\nThe semiconductor and communications industries are highly cyclical and subject to rapid change and evolving industry standards and, from time to time, have experienced significant downturns in customer demand. These downturns are characterized by decreases in product demand, excess customer inventories and accelerated erosion of prices; factors which have caused, and could continue to cause, substantial fluctuations in our net revenue and in our operating results. Any downturns in the semiconductor and communications industries may be severe and prolonged, and any failure of these industries to fully recover from downturns could harm our business. For example, because a significant portion of our expense is fixed in the near term or is incurred in advance of anticipated sales, during these downturns we may not be able to decrease our expenses rapidly enough to offset unanticipated shortfalls in revenues, which would adversely affect our operating results. Even as the industry recovers from a downturn, some OEMs and ODMs may continue to slow down their research and development activities, cancel or delay new product development, reduce their inventories and/or take a cautious approach to acquiring products, which may negatively impact our business.\nThe semiconductor and communications industries also periodically experience increased demand and production capacity constraints, which may affect the ability of companies such as ours to ship products to customers. Any factor adversely affecting either the semiconductor or communications industries in general, or the particular segments of any of these industries that our solutions target, may adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and could negatively impact our operating results, cash flow and financial condition. The semiconductor and communications industries may experience supply shortages due to sudden increases in demand beyond foundry capacity. In addition to capacity issues, during periods of increased demand these industries may also experience difficulty obtaining sufficient manufacturing, assembly and test resources from manufacturers. If, as a result of these industry issues or other factors that cause capacity constraints at our suppliers, we are unable to meet our customers' increased demand for our solutions, we would miss opportunities for additional revenue and could experience a negative impact on our relationships with affected customers.\nOur operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future, which could lead to volatility in the price of our common stock.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate, on an annual and a quarterly basis, as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. For example, while we were profitable in 2010 through 2012, we incurred a net loss in 2013 and 2014. These fluctuations in our operating results may cause our stock price to fluctuate as well. The primary factors that are likely to affect our quarterly and annual operating results include:\n\u2022\nthe timing of, and our ability to close, the potential Merger with MaxLinear;\n\u2022\nthe success of our recently announced business restructuring;\n\u2022\nchanges in demand for our solutions or products offered by service providers and our customers;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of orders, especially from significant service providers and customers;\n\u2022\nthe seasonal nature of the sales of products that incorporate our solutions by certain service providers which may affect the timing of orders for our solutions;\n\u2022\nthe level and timing of capital spending of service providers, both in the United States and in international markets;\n\u2022\ncompetitive market conditions, including pricing actions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nadverse perception of our company, our solutions and our products or their features by service providers or our customers, or in the market generally;\n\u2022\nany delay in the development, certification or adoption associated with new MoCA standards by the alliance, OEMs or service providers;\n\u2022\nany cut backs or delayed deployments of products that include our solutions by service providers;\n\u2022\nour unpredictable and lengthy sales cycles;\n\u2022\nthe mix of solutions and solution configurations sold;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully define, design and release new solutions on a timely basis that meet customers\u2019 or service providers\u2019 needs;\n\u2022\ncosts related to acquisitions of complementary products, technologies or businesses;\n\u2022\nnew solution introductions and enhancements, or the market anticipation of new solutions and enhancements, by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing of revenue recognition on sales arrangements, which may include multiple deliverables and the effect of our use of inventory \u201chubbing\u201d arrangements;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in our operating expenses;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and political conditions in the countries where we operate or our solutions are sold or used;\n\u2022\nour ability to attain and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our solutions, including adequate allocation of wafer, assembly and test capacity for our solutions by our subcontractors;\n\u2022\nour customers\u2019 ability to obtain other components needed to manufacture their products;\n\u2022\nthe cost and availability of components and raw materials used in our solutions, including, without limitation, the price of gold and copper;\n\u2022\nchanges in manufacturing costs, including wafer, test and assembly costs, manufacturing yields and solution quality and reliability;\n\u2022\nproductivity of our sales and marketing force;\n\u2022\nlong, engineering-intensive product development and testing cycles, including expensive third-party \"tape-out\" costs required to bring parts to production, which make it difficult to quickly adjust expenses in response to changes in revenue or revenue outlook;\n\u2022\nfixed expenses and long-term commitments that also limit our ability to reduce operating expenses in a particular quarter if revenues for that quarter fall below expectations;\n\u2022\nfuture accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting policies;\n\u2022\ndisputes between content owners and service providers that result in the delay or elimination of the sale of products using our technology;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with litigation; and\n\u2022\ndomestic and international regulatory changes.\nUnfavorable changes in any of the above factors, many of which are beyond our control, could significantly harm our business and results of operations. You should not rely on the results of prior periods as an indication of our future performance.\nOur sales are subject to seasonality, which may cause our revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nMany of our solutions are incorporated into consumer electronic devices, which are subject to seasonality and other fluctuations in demand. As a result, we tend to have slower sales in the first quarter of each year and, to a lesser extent, in the second quarter of each year as compared to the third and fourth quarters when manufacturers prepare for the major holiday selling season at the end of each year, which is traditionally the biggest quarter for consumer electronic retail sales. This seasonal trend may or may not continue in the future. Accordingly, our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by political and economic conditions in the countries in which we conduct business and our solutions are sold.\nWe are exposed to general global economic and market conditions, particularly those impacting the semiconductor industry. Uncertainty about current global economic conditions may cause businesses to continue to postpone spending in response to tighter credit, unemployment or negative financial news. This uncertainty has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business as service providers cut back or delay deployments that include our solutions and to the extent that consumers decrease their discretionary spending for enhanced video offerings from service providers, which may in turn lead to cautious or reduced spending by service providers and, in turn, may lead to a decrease in orders for our solutions, thereby adversely affecting our operating results. Our operating results may also be adversely affected by changes in tax laws as governments react to address the gap between their spending outflows and tax revenue inflows.\nWe may also experience adverse conditions in our cost base due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that reduce the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar, increase research and development expenses and otherwise harm our business. These conditions may harm our margins and prevent us from sustaining profitability if we are unable to increase the selling prices of our solutions or reduce our costs sufficiently to offset the effects of effective increases in our costs. Our attempts to offset the effects of cost increases through controlling our expenses, passing cost increases on to our customers or any other method may not succeed.\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit markets and prices of marketable equity and fixed-income securities. The primary objective of most of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade, liquid, fixed-income securities and money market instruments denominated in U.S. dollars. If the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value, and the decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we will be required to write down the value of our investments, which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio is affected by the credit condition of the U.S. financial sector. A deterioration in credit conditions or the U.S. financial sector could adversely affect the value, realized or unrealized, of our investments and cause us to record significant impairment losses.\nThe success of our DBS ODU solutions depends on the demand for our solutions within the satellite digital television market and the growth of this overall market.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales of our DBS ODU solutions into markets served by digital broadcast satellite providers and their ODM and OEM partners, the deployment of which may also increase demand for our MoCA-compliant Connectivity solutions. These revenues result from the demand for HD based TV's and DVR's within single family households, multi-dwelling units and hospitality establishments that receive their video from digital broadcast satellites. The digital broadcast satellite market may not grow in the future as anticipated or a significant market slowdown may occur, which would in turn reduce the demand for applications or devices, such as multi-switch and low-noise block converters that rely on our digital broadcast satellite outdoor unit solutions. Because of the intense competition in the satellite, terrestrial and cable digital television markets, the unproven technology of many products addressing these markets and the short product life cycles of many consumer applications or devices, it is difficult to predict the potential size and future growth rate of the markets for our digital broadcast satellite outdoor unit solutions. If the demand for our digital broadcast satellite outdoor unit solutions is not as great as we expect, or if we are unable to produce competitive solutions to meet that demand, our revenues could be adversely affected.\nThe market for our broadband access solutions is limited and these solutions may not be widely adopted.\nOur broadband access solutions are designed to meet broadband access requirements in areas characterized by fiber optic network deployments that terminate within one kilometer of customer premises. We believe the primary geographic markets for our broadband access solutions are currently in China and in parts of Europe where there are many multi-dwelling units and fiber optic networks that extend to or near a customer premises. For the foreseeable future, we do not expect to generate significant revenues from sales of our broadband access solutions in North America, which is generally characterized by low-density housing, or in developing nations that do not generally have extensive fiber optic networks. To the extent our efforts to sell our broadband access solutions into currently targeted markets are unsuccessful, the demand for these solutions may not develop as anticipated or may decline, either of which could adversely affect our future revenues. Moreover, these markets have a large number of service providers and varying regulatory standards, both of which may delay any widespread adoption of our solutions and increase the time during which competing technologies could be introduced and displace our solutions.\nIn addition, if areas characterized by fiber optic networks that terminate within one kilometer of customer premises do not continue to grow, or we are unable to develop broadband access solutions that are competitive outside of these areas, the demand for our broadband access solutions may not grow and our revenues may be limited. Even if the markets in which our broadband access solutions are targeted continue to grow or we are able to serve additional markets, customers and service providers may not adopt our technology. There are a growing number of competing technologies for delivering high-speed broadband access from the service provider\u2019s network to the customer\u2019s premises. For example, our broadband access solutions face competition from products using DOCSIS, versions of DSL, Ethernet, fiber to the home and LTE solutions. Moreover, there are many other access technologies that are currently in development including some low cost proprietary solutions. If service providers adopt competing products or technologies, the demand for our broadband access solutions will decline and we may not be able to generate significant revenues from these solutions.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our growth, and we may need to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements of our growth, either of which could harm our business and operating results.\nIf we decide to expand our business to pursue market opportunities for our products or technologies, we would need to grow the overall size of our operations. To effectively manage our growth, we would need to continue to expand our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. We intend to continue to pursue new market opportunities and new markets for our products and also to develop new solution offerings and pursue new customers. If we fail to adequately manage our growth the quality of our products and the management of our operations could suffer, which could adversely affect our operating results. Our success in managing our growth will be dependent upon our ability to:\n\u2022\nenhance our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures;\n\u2022\nexpand our facilities and equipment and develop new sources of supply for the manufacture, assembly and testing of our semiconductor solutions when and as needed and on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully hire, train, motivate and productively deploy employees, including technical personnel; and\n\u2022\nexpand our international resources.\nOur inability to address effectively any of these factors, alone or in combination with others, could harm our ability to execute our business strategy. In addition, in 2013 we transitioned to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system and we are continuing to expand the capabilities of that system. If that ERP system is deficient or inadequate in any material respect, it could impede our ability to manufacture products, order materials, generate management reports, invoice customers, and comply with laws and regulations. Any of these types of disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and profitability.\nOur product and technology development and licensing arrangements with customers, companies that we have investments in and other third parties may not be successful.\nWe have entered into development, product collaboration and technology licensing arrangements with customers, companies we have investments in and other third parties, and we expect to enter into new arrangements of these kinds from time to time in the future. We have various obligations and commitments to third parties related to these arrangements. Such arrangements can magnify several risks for us, including loss of control over the development and development timeline of jointly developed products. Accordingly, we face increased risk that our development activities with or for third parties may result in products or technologies that are not commercially successful or that are not available in a timely fashion. In addition, any third party with whom we enter into a development, product collaboration or technology licensing arrangement may fail to commit sufficient resources to the project, change its policies or priorities and abandon or fail to perform its obligations related to the collaboration. The failure to timely develop commercially successful products through our development activities with their parties as a result of any of these and other challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAny acquisition, strategic relationship, joint venture or investment could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nWe may continue to pursue acquisitions, strategic relationships, joint ventures, collaborations, technology licenses and investments that we believe may allow us to complement our growth strategy, increase market share in our current markets or expand into adjacent markets, or broaden our technology and intellectual property.\nSuch transactions, including our 2012 acquisition of the STB business from Trident and our 2013 acquisition of assets from Mobius Semiconductor, Inc., or Mobius, are often complex, time consuming and expensive. We will need to overcome challenges, some of which may be significant, in order to realize the benefits or synergies from the acquisitions we have completed to date and any acquisitions we may complete from time to time in the future. Such acquisitions present numerous challenges and risks including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating any acquired workforce and merging operations;\n\u2022\nattrition and the loss of key personnel or the impairment of relationships with employees, suppliers and customers;\n\u2022\ncreating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;\n\u2022\nan acquired company, asset or technology, or a strategic collaboration or licensed asset or technology not furthering our business strategy as anticipated;\n\u2022\nuncertainty related to the value, benefits or legitimacy or intellectual property or technologies acquired in such transaction;\n\u2022\nthe acquisition of a partner with which we have a joint venture, investment or strategic relationship by an unaffiliated third party that either delays or jeopardizes the original intent of the partnering relationship or investment;\n\u2022\nour overpayment for a company, asset or technology or changes in the economic or market conditions or assumptions underlying our decision to make an acquisition may subsequently make the acquisition less profitable or strategic than originally anticipated;\n\u2022\nour inability to liquidate an investment in a privately held company when we believe it is prudent to do so which results in a significant reduction in value or loss of our entire investment;\n\u2022\ndifficulties entering and competing in new product categories or geographic markets and increased competition, including price competition;\n\u2022\nsignificant problems or liabilities, including increased intellectual property and employment related litigation exposure, associated with acquired businesses, assets or technologies;\n\u2022\nthe need to use a significant portion of our available cash or issue additional equity securities that would dilute the then-current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership in connection with any such transaction, or make unanticipated follow-on investments or incur substantial debt or contingent liabilities in an effort to preserve value in the initial transaction;\n\u2022\nrequirements to devote substantial managerial and engineering resources to any strategic relationship, joint venture or collaboration, which could detract from our other efforts or significantly increase our costs;\n\u2022\nlack of control over the actions of our business partners in any strategic relationship, joint venture, collaboration or investment, which could significantly delay the introduction of planned solutions or otherwise make it difficult or impossible to realize the expected benefits of such relationship; and\n\u2022\nrequirements to record substantial charges and amortization expense related to certain intangible assets, deferred stock-based compensation and other items.\nAny one of these challenges or risks could impair our ability to realize any benefit from our acquisitions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or investments after we have expended resources on them. The inability to integrate successfully any businesses we acquire, or any significant delay in achieving integration, could delay introduction of new solutions and require expenditure of additional resources to achieve integration. Further, acquisitions also frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to potential impairments, which could harm our financial results.\nWe may enter into negotiations for acquisitions, relationships, joint ventures or investments that are not ultimately consummated. These negotiations could result in significant diversion of our management's time, as well as substantial out-of-pocket costs, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results during the periods in which such costs are incurred.\nWe cannot forecast the number, timing or size of future acquisitions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or investments, or the effect that any such transactions might have on our operating or financial results. Any such transaction could disrupt our business and harm our operating results and financial condition.\nWe may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic benefits from the businesses we acquire or be able to successfully integrate such businesses with ours.\nWe will need to overcome challenges, some of which may be significant, in order to realize the benefits or synergies from the acquisitions we have completed to date and any acquisitions that we may complete from time to time in the future. These challenges include the following:\n\u2022\nintegrating businesses, operations and technologies;\n\u2022\nretaining and assimilating key personnel;\n\u2022\nretaining existing customers and attracting additional customers;\n\u2022\ncreating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems, including with respect to our expanded international operations;\n\u2022\nobtaining intellectual property rights, contractual rights or other rights or resources from third parties necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits and synergies associated with the acquired business;\n\u2022\nmeeting the challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees who may be located at geographic locations distant from our headquarters and senior management; and\n\u2022\nimplementing appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs.\nIntegration in particular may involve considerable risks and may not be successful. These risks include the following:\n\u2022\nthe potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management;\n\u2022\nthe potential strain on our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures;\n\u2022\nunanticipated expenses and potential delays related to integration of the operations, technology and other resources of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\nthe impairment of relationships with employees, suppliers and customers; and\n\u2022\npotential unknown or contingent liabilities.\nThe inability to integrate successfully any businesses we acquire, or any significant delay in achieving integration, could delay introduction of new solutions and require expenditure of additional resources to achieve integration.\nInvestors should not rely on attempts to combine our historical financial results with those of any of our acquired businesses as separate operating entities to predict our future results of operations as a combined entity.\nThe average selling prices of our solutions have historically decreased over time and will likely do so in the future, which may reduce our revenues and gross margin.\nOur solutions and products sold by other companies in our industry have historically experienced a decrease in average selling prices over time. We anticipate that the average selling prices of our solutions will continue to decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures, increased sales discounts and new product introductions from our competitors. For example, we expect that other chipset manufacturers who are members of MoCA will produce competing chipsets and create pricing pressure for such solutions. Broadcom's and others' announcements about the availability of competing discrete MoCA chipsets and integrated MoCA SoCs in certain applications will put further pressure on pricing. Our future operating results may be harmed due to the decrease of our average selling prices. To maintain our current gross margins or increase our gross margins in the future, we must develop and introduce on a timely basis new solutions and solution enhancements, continually reduce our solution costs and manage solution transitions in a timely and cost-effective manner. Our failure to do so would likely cause our revenues and gross margins to decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cause the value of our common stock to decline.\nFluctuations in the mix of solutions we sell may adversely affect our financial results.\nBecause of differences in selling prices and manufacturing costs among our solutions, the mix and types of solutions sold affect the average selling price of our solutions and have a substantial impact on our revenues and profit margins. To the extent our sales mix shifts toward increased sales of our relatively lower-margin solutions, our overall gross margins will be negatively affected. Fluctuations in the mix and types of our solutions sold may also affect the extent to which we are able to recover our costs and expenditures associated with a particular solution, and as a result, can negatively impact our financial results.\nOur solution development efforts are time-consuming, require substantial research and development expenditures and may not generate an acceptable return.\nOur solution development efforts require substantial research and development expense. Our research and development expense was $117.2 million and $114.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. There can be no assurance that we will achieve an acceptable return on our research and development efforts.\nThe development of our solutions is also highly complex. Due to the relatively small size of our solution design teams, our research and development efforts in our core technologies may lag behind those of our competitors, some of whom have substantially greater financial and technical resources. In the past, we have occasionally experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new solutions and solution enhancements, and we could experience delays in the future. Unanticipated problems in developing solutions could also divert substantial engineering resources, which may impair our ability to develop new solutions and enhancements and could substantially increase our costs. Furthermore, we may expend significant amounts on a research and development program that may not ultimately result in a commercially successful solution, and we have in the past terminated ongoing research and development programs before they could be brought to successful conclusions. As a result of these and other factors, we may be unable to develop and introduce new solutions successfully and in a cost-effective and timely manner, and any new solutions we develop and offer may never achieve market acceptance or an acceptable return on our investment. Any failure to develop future solutions that are commercially successful would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe continually evaluate the benefits, on a solution-by-solution basis, of migrating to higher performance or lower cost process technologies in order to produce higher performance, more efficient or better integrated circuits because we believe this migration is required to remain competitive. Other companies in our industry have experienced difficulty in migrating to new process technologies and, consequently, have suffered reduced yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels. We may experience similar difficulties. Moreover, we are dependent on our relationships with subcontractors and the products of electronic design automation tool vendors to successfully migrate to newer or better process technologies. Our third-party manufacturers may not make newer or better process technologies available to us on a timely or cost-effective basis, if at all. If our third-party manufacturers do not make newer or better manufacturing process technologies available to us on a timely or cost-effective basis, or if we experience difficulties or delays in migrating to these processes, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and business prospects.\nOur solutions typically have lengthy sales cycles, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate, and a service provider, ODM or OEM customer may decide to cancel or change its service or product plans, which could cause us to lose anticipated sales and expected revenue.\nOur solutions typically have lengthy sales cycles. Before deciding to deploy a product containing one of our solutions, a service provider must first evaluate our solutions. This initial evaluation period can vary considerably based on the service provider and solution being evaluated, and could take a significant amount of time to complete. Solutions incorporating new technologies generally require longer periods for evaluation. After this initial evaluation period, if a service provider decides to adopt our solutions, that service provider and the applicable ODM or OEM customers will need to further test and evaluate our solutions prior to completing the design of the equipment that will incorporate our solutions. Additional time is needed to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our solutions. Due to these lengthy sales cycles, we may experience significant delays from the time we incur research and development and sales expenses until the time, if ever, that we generate sales and revenue from these solutions. The delays inherent in these lengthy sales cycles increase the risk that a customer will decide to cancel or change its product plans. We regularly experience changes, delays and cancellations in the purchase plans of service providers or our customers. A cancellation or change in plans by a service provider, ODM or OEM customer could prevent us from realizing anticipated sales and the associated revenue. In addition, our anticipated sales could be lost or substantially reduced if a significant service provider, ODM or OEM customer reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle or chooses not to release equipment that contains our solutions. We may invest significant time and effort in marketing to a particular customer that does not ultimately result in a sale to that customer. As a result of these lengthy and uncertain sales cycles for our solutions, it is difficult for us to predict if or when our customers may purchase solutions in volume from us, our projected financial results may fluctuate and prove inaccurate, and our actual operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, which may negatively affect our operating results for any given quarter.\nWe have limited control over the indirect channels of distribution we utilize, which makes it difficult to accurately forecast orders and could result in the loss of certain sales opportunities.\nA portion of our revenue is realized through independent resellers and distributors that are not under our control. For the year ended December 31, 2014, 2% of our net revenues were through these entities. For the year ended December 31, 2013, 3% of our net revenues were through these entities. These independent sales organizations generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or terminate their representation of us. Our revenues could be adversely affected if our relationships with resellers or distributors were to deteriorate or if the financial condition of one or more significant resellers or distributors were to decline. In addition, as our business grows, there may be an increased reliance on indirect channels of distribution. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining or expanding these indirect channels of distribution. This uncertainty could result in the loss of certain sales opportunities. Furthermore, our reliance on indirect channels of distribution may reduce visibility with respect to future business opportunities, thereby making it more difficult to accurately forecast orders. Further, we use the \u201csell-through\u201d accounting policy model which recognizes revenue only upon shipment of the merchandise from our distributor to the final customer. Because we use the \u201csell-through\u201d methodology, we may have variability in our revenue from quarter to quarter.\nIf we do not achieve additional design wins in the future or if we do not complete our design-in activities before a customer\u2019s design window closes, our future sales and revenues could be adversely affected and our customer relationships could be harmed.\nTo achieve design wins with OEM customers and ODMs, we must define and deliver cost-effective, innovative and high performance solutions on a timely basis, before our competitors do so. In addition, the timing of our design-in activities with key customers and prospective customers may not align with their open design windows, which may or may not be known to us, making design win predictions more difficult. If we miss a particular customer\u2019s design window, we may be forced to wait an entire year or even longer for the next opportunity to compete for the customer\u2019s next design. The loss of a particular design opportunity could eliminate or substantially delay revenues from certain target customers and markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and future prospects as well as our customer relationships. Even after a design win, customers are not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commercially successful, or for any other reason. We may not continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur solutions must interoperate with many software applications and hardware found in service providers\u2019 networks and other devices in the home, and if they do not interoperate properly our business would be harmed.\nOur solutions must interoperate with service providers\u2019 networks and other devices in the home, which often have varied and complex specifications, utilize multiple protocol standards, software applications and products from multiple vendors, and contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time. As a result, we must continually ensure that our solutions interoperate properly with existing and planned future networks. To meet these requirements, we must undertake development efforts that involve significant expense and the dedication of substantial employee resources. We may not accomplish these development efforts quickly or cost-effectively, if at all. If we fail to maintain or anticipate compatibility with products, software or equipment found in our customers\u2019 networks, we may face substantially reduced demand for our solutions, which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into collaborations or interoperability arrangements with equipment and software vendors providing for the use, integration or interoperability of their technology with our solutions. These arrangements would give us access to and enable interoperability with various products or technologies in the connected home entertainment market. If these relationships fail to achieve their goals, we would have to devote substantially more resources to the development of alternative solutions and the support of our existing solutions, or the addressable market for our solutions may become limited. In many cases, these parties are either companies that we compete with directly in other areas or companies that have extensive relationships with our existing and potential customers and may have influence over the purchasing decisions of these customers. A number of our competitors have stronger relationships than we do with some of our existing and potential customers and, as a result, our ability to have successful arrangements with these companies may be harmed. Our failure to establish or maintain key relationships with third-party equipment and software vendors may harm our ability to successfully sell and market our solutions. We are currently devoting significant resources to the development of these relationships. Our operating results could be adversely affected if these efforts do not result in the revenues necessary to offset these investments.\nIn addition, if we find errors in the software or hardware used in service providers\u2019 networks or problematic network configurations or settings we may have to modify our solutions so that they will interoperate with these networks. This could cause longer installation times for our solutions and order cancellations, either of which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe do not have long-term commitments from our customers and our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay production, and if we fail to forecast demand for our solutions accurately, we may incur solution shortages, delays in solution shipments or excess or insufficient solution inventory.\nWe sell our solutions to customers who integrate them into their products. We do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers. We have limited visibility as to the volume of our solutions that our customers are selling or carrying in their inventory. In addition, certain service providers are affected by seasonality in their deployment of products that incorporate our solutions, which may in turn impact the timing of our sales. Because production lead times often exceed the amount of time required to fulfill orders, we often must build inventory in advance of orders, relying on an imperfect demand forecast to project volumes and solution mix.\nOur demand forecast accuracy, and our ability to manage our inventory carrying levels accurately, can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including inaccurate forecasting by our customers, changes in market conditions, adverse changes in our solution order mix and demand for our customers\u2019 products. We have in the past had customers dramatically decrease and increase their requested production quantities with little or no advance notice to us. Even after an order is received, our customers may cancel these orders, postpone taking delivery or request a decrease in production quantities. Any such cancellation, postponement of delivery or decrease in production quantity subjects us to a number of risks, most notably that our projected sales will not materialize on schedule or at all, leading to unanticipated revenue shortfalls, reduced profit margins and excess or obsolete inventory which we may be unable to sell to other customers or which we may be required to sell at reduced prices or write off entirely. Furthermore, changes to our customers' requirements may result in disputes with our customers which could adversely impact our future relationships with those customers. Alternatively, if we are unable to project customer requirements accurately, we may not build enough solutions, which could lead to delays in solution shipments and lost sales opportunities in the near term, as well as force our customers to identify alternative sources of supply, which could affect our ongoing relationships with these customers and potentially reduce our market share. If we do not timely fulfill customer demands, our customers may cancel their orders and we may be subject to customer claims for cost of replacement.\nOur ability to accurately predict revenues and inventory needs, and to effectively manage inventory levels, may be adversely impacted due to our use of inventory \u201chubbing\u201d arrangements.\nWe are party to an inventory \u201chubbing\u201d arrangement with Cisco and we may enter into similar arrangements with other customers in the future. Pursuant to these arrangements, we ship our solutions to a designated third-party warehouse, or hub, rather than shipping them directly to the customer. The solutions generally remain in the hub until the customer removes them for incorporation into its own products. In the absence of any hubbing arrangement, we generally recognize revenues on sales of our solutions upon shipment of those solutions to the buyer. Under a hubbing arrangement, however, we maintain ownership of our solutions in the hub, and therefore do not recognize the related revenue until the date our customer removes them from the hub. As a result, our ability to accurately predict future revenues recognized from sales to customers with which we implement hubbing arrangements may be impaired, and we may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results depending on when such customers remove our solutions from the hub, which they may do with little or no lead time. In the short term, we may experience an increase in operating expenses as we build and ship inventory to the hub and will not recognize revenues from sales of this inventory, if at all, until such customers remove it from the hub at a later time. Furthermore, because we continue to own but do not maintain control over our solutions after they are shipped to the hub, our ability to effectively manage inventory levels may be impaired as our shipments under the hubbing arrangement increase and we may be exposed to additional risk that the inventory in the hub becomes obsolete before sales are recognized.\nWe extend credit to our customers, sometimes in large amounts, but there is no guarantee every customer will be able to pay our invoices when they become due.\nAs part of our routine business, we extend credit to customers purchasing our solutions. While our customers may have the ability to pay on the date of shipment or on the date credit is granted, their financial condition could change and there is no guarantee that customers will ever pay the invoices. Rapid changes in our customers\u2019 financial conditions and risks associated with extending credit to our customers can subject us to a higher financial risk and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. This risk is exacerbated by our reliance on a limited number of customers who purchase our solutions.\nWe depend on a limited number of third parties to manufacture, assemble and test our solutions which reduces our control over key aspects of our solutions and their availability.\nWe do not own or operate a manufacturing, assembly or test facility for our solutions. Rather, we outsource the manufacture, assembly and testing of our solutions to third-party subcontractors including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd., Jazz Semiconductor, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Tower Semiconductor, Inc.), Amkor Technologies, Inc., Advance Semiconductor Engineering Group, United Test and Assembly Center (or UTAC Group) and Giga Solution Tech. Co., Ltd. Accordingly, we are greatly dependent on a limited number of suppliers to deliver quality solutions on time. Our reliance on sole or limited suppliers involves several risks, including susceptibility to increased manufacturing costs if competition for foundry capacity intensifies and reduced control over the following:\n\u2022\nsupply of our solutions available for sale;\n\u2022\npricing, quality and timely delivery of our solutions;\n\u2022\nprices and availability of components for our solutions; and\n\u2022\nproduction capacity for our solutions, including shortages due to the difficulties of suppliers to meet production capacities because of unexpected increases in demand.\nBecause we rely on a limited number of third-party manufacturers, if we elect to expand the number of third-party manufacturers to whom we outsource the manufacture, assembly or testing of our solutions, or if we are required to change contract manufacturers because any of our contract manufacturers become unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our solutions for any reason, we may sustain lost revenues, increased costs and damage to our customer relationships or other harm to our business. Any engagement of new or alternative third-party manufacturers will require us to spend significant time and expense in identifying and qualifying such manufacturers and solutions manufactured by such manufacturers will, in turn, need to be qualified by our customers. The lead time required to establish a relationship with a new manufacturer is long, and it takes time to adapt a solution's design and technological requirements to a particular manufacturer's processes. In connection with our engagement of new or alternative third-party manufacturers, we may experience bugs and defects as we work through the process, which could result in delayed or decreased revenue and harm to our reputation and our relationship with our customers.\nManufacturing defects may not be detected by the testing process performed by our subcontractors. If one of our assembly or foundries were to experience a major quality or reliability issue in their manufacturing processes it could cause epidemic failures, recalls, increased costs of qualifying new suppliers, customer damages and financial liabilities. If defects are discovered after we have shipped our solutions, we may be exposed to warranty and consequential damages claims from our customers. Such claims may have an adverse impact on our revenues and operating results. Furthermore, if we are unable to deliver quality solutions, our reputation would be harmed, which could result in the loss of future orders and business with our customers.\nWhen demand for manufacturing capacity is high, we may take various actions to try to secure sufficient capacity, which may be costly and negatively impact our operating results.\nThe ability of each of our supplier's manufacturing facilities to provide us with chipsets is limited by its available capacity and existing obligations. Although we may have purchase order commitments to supply products to our customers, we do not have a guaranteed level of production capacity from any of our suppliers\u2019 facilities to produce our solutions. Facility capacity may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices. In addition, our subcontractors may allocate capacity to the production of other companies\u2019 products and thereby reduce deliveries to us on short notice.\nIn order to secure sufficient manufacturing facility capacity when demand is high and mitigate the risks associated with an inability to meet our customers\u2019 demands for our solutions, we may enter into various arrangements with suppliers that could be costly and harm our operating results, including:\n\u2022\noption payments or other prepayments to a supplier;\n\u2022\nnonrefundable deposits with or loans to suppliers in exchange for capacity commitments;\n\u2022\ncontracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of components over extended periods; and\n\u2022\npurchase of testing equipment for specific use at the facilities of our suppliers.\nWe may not be able to make any such arrangements in a timely fashion or at all, and any arrangements may be costly, reduce our financial flexibility and not be on terms favorable to us. Moreover, if we are able to secure capacity, we may be obligated to use all of that capacity or incur penalties. These penalties and obligations may be expensive and require significant capital and could harm our business.\nOur solutions may contain defects or errors which may adversely affect their market acceptance and our reputation and expose us to product liability claims.\nOur solutions are very complex and may contain defects or errors, especially when first introduced, when in full production, or when new versions are released. Despite testing, errors may occur. Such errors may include manufacturing defects, design defects or software bugs. Such defects or errors could affect the performance of our solutions, delay the development or release of new solutions or new versions of solutions, adversely affect our reputation and our customers\u2019 willingness to buy solutions from us, and adversely affect market acceptance of our solutions. Any such errors or delays in releasing new solutions or new versions of solutions or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share, increase our service costs, cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning our solutions, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks. Our solutions must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a device or application in which our solution is used, it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems. The occurrence of hardware and software errors, whether or not caused by our solutions, could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our solutions, and therefore delay our ability to recognize revenue from sales, and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses. Moreover, problems with our solutions that are only discovered after they have been deployed by a service provider could result in a greater number of truck rolls, and this in turn could adversely affect our sales or increase the cost of remediation. The occurrence of any such problems could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe use of our solutions also entails the risk of product liability claims. Such claims may require us to incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. We maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our solutions, but our insurance coverage may not cover any claim asserted against us adequately, or at all. In addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation which may divert our technical and other resources from solution development efforts and divert our management\u2019s time and other resources. Any limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as a result of federal, state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions in the United States or other countries.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or be required to suspend production or alter our manufacturing processes.\nWe are subject to a variety of international, federal, state, and local governmental regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, generation, disposal, and labeling of toxic or other hazardous substances that make up the composition of many of our solutions. If we fail to comply with these regulations, substantial fines could be imposed on us, and we could be required to suspend production or alter manufacturing processes, either of which could have a negative effect on our sales, income, and business operations. Failure to comply with environmental regulations could subject us to civil or criminal sanctions and property damage or personal injury claims. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time, imposing even greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations, which could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nNew rules related to conflict minerals disclosure could negatively impact our business.\nThe SEC has adopted disclosure rules for companies that use conflict minerals in their products, with substantial supply chain verification and reporting requirements in the event that the minerals and metals come from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. These new rules and verification requirements impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers, and may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. Further, depending on the results of our due diligence and our resulting disclosure, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed.\nCertain of our customers\u2019 products and service providers\u2019 services are subject to governmental regulation.\nGovernmental regulation could place constraints on our customers and service providers\u2019 services and, consequently, reduce our customers\u2019 demand for our solutions. For example, the Federal Communications Commission has broad jurisdiction over products that emit radio frequency signals in the United States. Similar governmental agencies regulate these products in other countries. Moreover, laws and regulations regarding local cable franchising, satellite broadcasting rights or government regulations related to net neutrality could have an adverse effect on service providers\u2019 ability to compete in the HD video and multimedia content delivery market. Although most of our solutions are not directly subject to current regulations of the Federal Communications Commission or any other federal or state communications regulatory agency, much of the equipment into which these solutions are incorporated is subject to direct governmental regulation. Accordingly, the effects of regulation on our customers or the industries in which they operate may, in turn, impede sales of our solutions. For example, demand for these solutions will decrease if equipment into which they are incorporated fails to comply with the specifications of the Federal Communications Commission.\nOur effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate, and we may not derive the anticipated tax benefits from any expansion of our international operations.\nOur effective tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors, many of which are outside of our control. Our effective tax rate is directly affected by the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate. We are also subject to changing tax laws, regulations and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings. Changes in applicable tax laws may cause fluctuations between reporting periods in which the changes take place. If our business opportunities outside the United States continue to grow, we may expand our international operations and staff to better support our expansion into international markets. We anticipate that this expansion will include the implementation of an international organizational structure that could result in an increasing percentage of our consolidated pre-tax income being derived from, and reinvested in, our international operations. Moreover, we anticipate that this pre-tax income would be subject to foreign tax at relatively lower tax rates when compared to the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and as a consequence, our future effective income tax rate may be lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate. There can be no assurance that significant pre-tax income will be derived from or reinvested in our international operations, that our international operations and sales will result in a lower effective income tax rate, or that we will implement an international organizational structure. In addition, our future effective income tax rate could be adversely affected if tax authorities challenge any international tax structure that we implement or if the relative mix of U.S. and international income changes for any reason. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our effective income tax rate will be less than the U.S. federal statutory rate.\nChanges in valuation allowance of deferred tax assets may affect our future operating results.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more-likely-than-not to be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and practical tax planning strategies. On a periodic basis we evaluate our deferred tax asset balance for realizability. To the extent we believe it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, we will increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future taxable income in related tax jurisdictions. If our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future, the valuation allowances may be increased or decreased, resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense.\nDuring 2013, we assessed that it was more-likely-than-not that we will not realize our federal deferred tax assets based on the absence of sufficient positive objective evidence that we would generate sufficient taxable income in our United States tax jurisdiction to realize the deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we recorded a valuation allowance on our federal deferred tax assets during the second quarter of 2013.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited, which could result in our payment of income taxes earlier than if we were able to fully utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $67.4 million and $28.3 million, respectively, and federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $21.0 million and $22.3 million, respectively. The tax benefits related to utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited due to ownership changes or as a result of other events. For example, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards that may be used to offset federal taxable income and federal tax liabilities when a corporation has undergone a significant change in its ownership. While prior changes in our ownership of acquired entities have resulted in annual limitations on the amount of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that may be utilized in the future, we do not anticipate that such annual limitations will preclude the utilization of substantially all the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards described above in the event we remain profitable. However, to the extent our use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is further limited by future offerings or transactions or by our implementation of an international tax structure or other future events, our income would be subject to cash payments of income tax earlier than it would be if we were able to fully utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards without such further limitation.\nWe may not be able to obtain the financing necessary to operate and grow our business.\nWe may require substantial funds to continue our research and development programs and to fulfill our planned operating goals. We anticipate that existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, investments and working capital at December 31, 2014 should enable us to maintain current and planned operations for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements, however, may vary from what we currently expect. There are a number of factors that may affect our planned future capital requirements and accelerate our need for additional working capital, many of which are outside our control. We may seek additional funding through public or private financings of debt or equity although additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we were to raise additional capital through further sales of our equity securities, our stockholders would suffer dilution of their equity ownership. If we engage in debt financing, we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, prohibit us from paying dividends, prohibit us from repurchasing our stock or making investments or force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios, any of which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur ability to compete and our business could be jeopardized if we are unable to secure or protect our intellectual property.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, maskworks, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. Assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, currently, the first to file a patent application is generally entitled to the patent. However, prior to March 16, 2013, in the United States, the first to invent was entitled to the patent. Patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, invalidated, rendered unenforceable or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products.\nFurthermore, although we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology by entering into nondisclosure agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and advisors, such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements. Moreover, we are required to license any of our patent claims that are essential to implement MoCA specifications to other MoCA members, who could potentially include our competitors, on reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing terms. In addition, in connection with commercial arrangements with our customers and the service providers who deploy equipment containing our solutions, we may be required to license our intellectual property to third parties, including competitors or potential competitors.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trademarks, copyrighted material, products or technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of our trademarks, copyrighted material and technology is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to prevent such unauthorized use will be successful, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as comprehensively as in the United States. In addition, if we become aware of a third party's unauthorized use or misappropriation of our trademarks, copyrighted material or technology, it may not be practicable, effective or cost-efficient for us to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights, particularly where the initiation of a claim might harm our business relationships or risk a costly and protracted lawsuit, including a potential countersuit by a competitor with patents that may implicate our solutions. If competitors engage in unauthorized use or misappropriation of our trademarks, copyrighted material or technology, our ability to compete effectively could be harmed.\nOur participation in \u201cpatent pools\u201d and standards setting organizations, or other business arrangements, may require us to license our patents to competitors and other third parties and limit our ability to enforce or collect royalties for our patents.\nIn addition to our existing obligations to license our patent claims that are essential to implement the MoCA specifications to other MoCA members, in the course of participating in patent pools and other standards setting organizations or pursuant to other business arrangements, we may agree to license certain of our technologies on a reasonable and non-discriminatory basis and, as a result, our control over the license of such technologies may be limited. We may also be unable to limit to whom we license some of our technologies and may be unable to restrict many terms of the license. Consequently, our competitors may obtain the right to use our technology. In addition, our control over the application and quality control of our technologies that are included in patent pools or otherwise necessary for implementing industry standards may be limited.\nAny dispute with a MoCA member regarding what patent claims are necessary to implement MoCA specifications could result in litigation which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are required to grant to other MoCA members a non-exclusive and world-wide license on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms to any of our patent claims that are essential to implement MoCA specifications. The meaning of reasonable and non-discriminatory has not been settled by the courts, and accordingly, it is not a well-defined concept. If we had a disagreement with a MoCA member regarding which of our patent claims are necessary to implement MoCA specifications or regarding whether the terms of any license by us under reasonable and non-discriminatory terms fall within the scope and meaning of reasonable and non-discriminatory, this could result in litigation. Any such litigation, regardless of its merits, could be time-consuming, expensive to resolve, divert our management's time and attention and harm our reputation. In addition, any such litigation could result in us being required to license on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms certain of our patent claims which we previously believed did not need to be licensed under our MoCA agreement. Significant disagreements or any litigation between us and any MoCA member regarding patent claims necessary to implement MoCA or the scope and meaning of our reasonable and non-discriminatory terms could have an adverse effect on our business and harm our competitive position.\nPossible third-party claims of infringement of proprietary rights against us, our customers or the service providers that purchase products from our customers, or other intellectual property claims or disputes, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by a high level of litigation based on allegations of infringement of proprietary rights. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are selling and developing solutions. Because patent applications take many years to issue, currently pending applications, known or unknown to us, may later result in issued patents that we infringe. In addition, third parties continue to actively seek new patents in our field. It is difficult or impossible to keep fully abreast of these developments and therefore, as we develop new and enhanced solutions, we may sell or distribute solutions that inadvertently infringe patents held by third parties.\nWe have in the past received, and in the future we, our customers or the service providers that purchase products from our customers may receive, inquiries from other patent holders and may become subject to claims that we infringe their intellectual property rights. Furthermore, we are, and may in the future be, engaged in development projects with technology partners that will result in the incorporation of technology contributed by us and our technology partners into one or more jointly developed products. Accordingly, even if our own technology and stand-alone products do not infringe third party patents, the technology that is contributed by any of our technology partners, or the combination of our technology with that of our technology partners, may infringe third party patents, subjecting us through the use, manufacture, sale, offer for sale or importation of our solutions to claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Any intellectual property claim or dispute, regardless of its merits, could force us, our customers or the service providers that purchase our solutions from our customers to license the third-party's patents for substantial royalty payments or cease the sale of the alleged infringing products or use of the alleged infringing technologies, or force us to defend ourselves and possibly our customers or contract manufacturers in litigation. Any cessation of solution sales by us, our customers or the service providers that purchase products from our customers could have a substantial negative impact on our revenues. Any litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial expense and significant diversion of our management's time and other resources. Moreover, any such litigation could subject us, our customers or the service providers that purchase our solutions from our customers to significant liability for damages (including treble damages), temporary or permanent injunctions, or the invalidation of proprietary rights or require us, our customers or the service providers that purchase products from our customers to license the third-party patents for substantial royalty or other payments.\nIn addition, we may also be required to indemnify our customers and contract manufacturers under our agreements if a third party alleges or if a court finds that our products or activities have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused another party's proprietary rights. We have received requests from certain customers to include increasingly broad indemnification provisions in our agreements with them. These indemnification provisions may, in some circumstances, extend our liability beyond the products we provide to include liability for combinations of components or system level designs and for consequential damages and/or lost profits. Even if claims or litigation against us are not valid or successfully asserted, these claims could result in significant costs and diversion of the attention of management and other key employees to defend.\nFinally, if another supplier to one of our customers, or a customer of ours itself, were found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third party, the supplier or customer could be ordered to cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of its infringing product(s) or process(es), either of which could result, indirectly, in a decrease in demand from our customers for our products. If such a decrease in demand for our products were to occur, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nOur use of open source software and third-party technologies, including software, could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our solutions.\nWe incorporate open source software into our solutions, including certain open source code which is governed by the GNU General Public License, Lesser GNU General Public License and Common Development and Distribution License. These licenses state that any program licensed under them may be liberally copied, modified and distributed. It is possible that a court would hold these licenses to be unenforceable or that someone could assert a claim for proprietary rights in a program developed and distributed under them. In such event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our solutions, make our proprietary code generally available in source code form (for example, proprietary code that links in particular ways to certain open source modules), which could result in our trade secrets being disclosed to the public and the potential loss of intellectual property rights in our software, require us to re-engineer our solutions, discontinue the sale of our solutions if re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a cost-effective and timely basis, or become subject to other consequences, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition to technologies we have already licensed, we may find that we need to incorporate certain proprietary third-party technologies, including software programs, into our solutions in the future. However, licenses to relevant third-party technologies may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Therefore, we could face delays in solution releases until alternative technology can be identified, licensed or developed, and integrated into our current solutions. Such alternative technology may not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all, and may ultimately not be as effective as the preferred technology. Any such delays or failures to obtain licenses, if they occur, could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nBecause we license some of our software source code directly to customers, we face increased risks that our trade secrets will be exposed through inadvertent or intentional disclosure, which could harm our competitive position or increase our costs.\nWe license some of our software source code to our customers, which increases the number of people who have access to some of our trade secrets and other proprietary rights. Contractual obligations of our licensees not to disclose or misuse our source code or not to reverse engineer our solutions may not be sufficient to prevent such disclosure or misuse. The costs of enforcing contractual rights could substantially increase our operating costs and may not be cost-effective, reasonable under the circumstances or ultimately succeed in protecting our proprietary rights. If our competitors access our source code or reverse engineer our solutions, they may gain further insight into the technology and design of our solutions, which would harm our competitive position.\nBecause we rely extensively on our information technology systems and network infrastructure, any disruption or infiltration of such systems could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of our business. A disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber attacks, employee theft or misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security and loss of critical data, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business. Our security procedures, such as virus protection software and our business continuity planning, such as our disaster recovery policies and back-up systems, may not be adequate or implemented properly to fully address the adverse effect of such events, which could adversely impact our operations. In addition, our business could be adversely affected to the extent we do not make the appropriate level of investment in our technology systems as our technology systems become out-of-date or obsolete and are not able to deliver the type of data integrity and reporting we need to run our business. Furthermore, when we implement new systems and/or upgrade existing systems, we could be faced with temporary or prolonged disruptions that could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to International Operations\nA significant portion of our revenue comes from our international customers, most of our products are manufactured overseas and a significant portion of our employees live and work outside the United States. As a result, our business may be harmed by political and economic conditions in foreign markets and the challenges associated with operating internationally.\nWe have derived, and expect to continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenues from international markets. Many of our customers in Asia incorporate our chipsets into their products that are then sold to U.S.-based service providers. Net revenues outside of the United States comprised 97% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. In addition, most of our products are manufactured overseas and a significant portion of our labor force is outside the United States. Our international presence has significantly increased in recent years as a result of our acquisition of the STB business from Trident in 2012 and as a result our exposure to the risks of international business activities increased. Certain of these risks, include:\n\u2022\ndifficulties involved in the staffing and management of geographically dispersed operations;\n\u2022\ncomplying with local laws and regulations, which are interpreted and enforced differently across jurisdictions and which can change significantly over time;\n\u2022\nlonger sales cycles in certain countries, especially on initial entry into a new geographical market;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty evaluating a customer\u2019s ability to pay, longer accounts receivable payment cycles and greater difficulty in the collection of past-due accounts;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions in each country;\n\u2022\nchallenges associated with operating in diverse cultural and legal environments;\n\u2022\nseasonal reductions in business activity specific to certain markets;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue, property and equipment from expropriation, natural disasters, nationalization, war, insurrection, terrorism and other political risks;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes and the overlap of different tax structures, including modifications to the U.S. tax code as a result of international trade regulations;\n\u2022\nforeign technical standards;\n\u2022\nchanges in currency exchange rates; and\n\u2022\nimport and export licensing requirements, tariffs, and other trade and travel restrictions.\nTo the extent our international sales are adversely affected by any of these risks or are otherwise unsuccessful, we could experience a reduction in revenue and our operating results could suffer.\nWe operate in jurisdictions in which local business practices may be inconsistent with international regulatory requirements, including anti-corruption and anti-bribery regulations prescribed under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which, among other things, prohibits giving or offering to give anything of value with the intent to influence the awarding of government contracts. Although we believe that we have adequate policies and enforcement mechanisms to ensure legal and regulatory compliance with the FCPA and other similar regulations, it is possible that some of our employees, subcontractors, agents or partners may violate any such legal and regulatory requirements, which may expose us to civil and/or criminal penalties and other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, our business and reputation may be harmed.\nIn addition, the laws that govern the protection of intellectual property rights in certain foreign countries where we sell our solutions, such as China and Korea, can make recognition and enforcement of contractual and intellectual property rights more expensive and difficult than is the case in the United States. In particular, we may have difficulty preventing ODMs and OEMs in these countries from incorporating our inventions, technologies, copyrights or trademarks into their products without our authorization or without paying us licensing fees. We may also experience difficulty enforcing our intellectual property rights in these countries, where intellectual property rights are not as respected as they are in the United States, Japan and Europe. Unauthorized use of our technologies and intellectual property rights may dilute or undermine the strength of our brand. Further, if we are not able to adequately monitor the use of our technologies by foreign-based ODMs and OEMs, or enforce our intellectual property rights in foreign countries, our revenue potential could be adversely affected.\nOur solutions are subject to export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nOur solutions are subject to U.S. export controls and may be exported outside the United States only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception, in part because we incorporate encryption technology into our solutions. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our solutions or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to implement our solutions in those countries. Changes in our solutions or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our solutions in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our solutions throughout their global systems or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries altogether. Any change in export or import regulations or related legislation, or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations or legislation, could result in decreased use of our solutions by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our solutions to, existing or potential customers internationally.\nIn addition, we may be subject to customs duties and export quotas, which could have a significant impact on our revenue and profitability. The future imposition of significant increases in the level of customs duties or export quotas could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSubstantially all of our solutions, and the products of many of our customers, are manufactured by third-party contractors located in the Pacific Rim, a region subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters, as well as economic and political instability. Any disruption to the operations of these contractors could cause significant delays in the production or shipment of our solutions.\nSubstantially all of our solutions are manufactured by third-party contractors located in the Pacific Rim. The risk of an earthquake in this area is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines to the facilities of our foundry, assembly and test subcontractors. The occurrence of earthquakes or other natural disasters, or the occurrence of other catastrophic events such as a pandemic in the region, could result in the disruption of our foundry or assembly and test capacity or in the ability of our customers to purchase the raw materials or parts necessary to manufacture products, such as digital video recorders, or DVRs, into which our solutions are incorporated. In addition, many countries within the Pacific Rim have experienced, and continue to experience, periods of economic and political instability. Any deterioration in the economic and political conditions in the Pacific Rim that disrupts the operations of our third-party contractors could also result in the disruption of our foundry or assembly and test capacity. Any disruption caused by an earthquake or other catastrophic event or from the deterioration of economic and political conditions could cause significant delays in the production or shipment of our solutions until we are able to shift our manufacturing, assembling or testing from the affected contractor to another third-party vendor. We may not, and our customers may not, be able to obtain alternate capacity on favorable terms, if at all.\nAs a result of our efforts to increase our sales in China, we are increasingly exposed to risks of doing business in China.\nWe expect to continue to expand our business and operations in China. Our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China's continuously evolving laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, currency controls, cross-border capital flows, environmental regulations, indigenous innovation, and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights. In addition, enforcement of existing laws or agreements in China may be inconsistent. Changes in the political environment, governmental policies or U.S.-China relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations, which could also have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. Further, the evolving labor market and increasing labor unrest in China may have a negative impact on our customers that would result in a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price at which you purchased such shares.\nThe market price for our common stock is volatile and may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:\n\u2022\nthe timing of, and our ability to close, the potential Merger with MaxLinear;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nchanges in factors that influence the timing or likelihood of completing the proposed Merger with MaxLinear;\n\u2022\nchanges in MaxLinear's stock price or the factors that influence MaxLinear's stock price;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those that sell semiconductor products in particular;\n\u2022\nthe timing of customer or service provider orders that may cause quarterly or other periodic fluctuations in our results that may, in turn, affect the market price of our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe seasonal nature of the deployment of products that incorporate our solutions by certain service providers which may affect the timing of orders for our solutions;\n\u2022\nthe timing of revenue recognition on sales arrangements, which may include multiple deliverables, and the effect of our use of inventory \u201chubbing\u201d arrangements;\n\u2022\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties impacting us or our business, including our filings with the SEC and announcements relating to solution development, litigation and intellectual property;\n\u2022\nthe sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new mergers or acquisition transactions;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance and understanding of our acquisitions;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technical innovations, new products or design wins by our competitors or customers;\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters or responses to these events; and\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles.\nIn addition, the stock markets, and in particular NASDAQ, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.\nFuture sales of our common stock or the issuance of securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of our common stock may depress our stock price.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by stockholders, our issuance of securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of our common stock, or the expectation or perception in the market that the holders of a large number of our shares of common stock intend to sell their shares, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock. Our common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price for our stock and lead to increased volatility in our stock price.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law might deter acquisition bids for us that you might consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our bylaws;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nprovide that in addition to any vote required by law or by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the approval by holders of at least 66-2/3% of our then outstanding common stock is required to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of our amended and restated bylaws.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nOur principal stockholders, executive officers and directors have substantial control over the company, which may prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may harm the market price of our common stock.\nAs of January 31, 2015 our executive officers, directors and holders of five percent or more of our outstanding common stock, beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 27.3% of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders may have interests that conflict with our other stockholders and, if acting together, have the ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets including the approval of the potential Merger with MaxLinear. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may harm the market price of our common stock by:\n\u2022\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change of control;\n\u2022\nimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us, including the potential Merger with MaxLinear; or\n\u2022\ndiscouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nThe continued expansion of our business will require substantial funding. Accordingly, we do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future, and, in fact, we are prohibited by the Merger Agreement from doing so without the consent of MaxLinear. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase or hold our common stock.", "PERMNO": 92460, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "ENTR.1"}
