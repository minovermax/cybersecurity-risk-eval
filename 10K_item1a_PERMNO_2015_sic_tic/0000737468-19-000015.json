Risk Factors.\nBefore making any investment decision with respect to our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below and in our other filings are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be impaired. In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose your investment. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nRisks Related to Our Banking Business\nChanges in the business and economic conditions, particularly those of southern New England, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nA deterioration in the economy or increased levels of unemployment, among other factors, could lead to erosion of customer confidence, a reduction in general business activity and increased market volatility. The resulting economic pressure on consumers and businesses and the lack of confidence in the financial markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. We primarily serve individuals and businesses located in southern New England and a substantial portion of our loans are secured by properties in southern New England. As a result, a significant portion of our earnings are closely tied to the economy of this region. The weakening or deterioration in the economy of southern New England, including as a result of, among other things, real or threatened acts of war, natural disasters and adverse weather, could result in the following consequences:\n\u2022\nloan delinquencies may increase;\n\u2022\nproblem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and services may decline;\n\u2022\ncollateral for our loans may decline in value, in turn reducing a customer's borrowing power and reducing the value of collateral securing a loan; and\n\u2022\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us.\nIn addition, revenues from mortgage banking activities are largely dependent on mortgage origination and sales volume. Changes in interest rates and the condition of housing markets, which are beyond our control, could adversely impact the volume of residential mortgage originations, sales and related mortgage banking revenues.\nFluctuations in interest rates may reduce our profitability.\nOur consolidated results of operations depend, to a large extent, on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. The narrowing of interest rate spreads could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, both domestic and foreign, and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities.\nCertain assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in market interest rates. Further, interest rates on some types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate prior to changes in broader market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind. Additionally, some assets such as adjustable-rate mortgage loans have features, such as rate caps and floors, which restrict changes in applicable interest rates.\nThe market values of most of our financial assets are sensitive to fluctuations in market interest rates. Fixed-rate investment securities, mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans typically decline in value as interest rates rise.\nChanges in market interest rates can also affect the extent to which our borrowers prepay loans and the rate of prepayments on mortgage-backed securities. When interest rates increase, prepayments generally decline and when interest rates\ndecrease prepayments generally increase. Prepayments may adversely affect the value of such loans and investment securities and the income generated by them. Particularly in a decreasing interest rate environment, prepayments may result in the proceeds having to be reinvested at a lower rate than the loan or mortgage-backed security being prepaid. Changes in interest rates can also affect the amount of loans that we originate, as well as the value of loans and our ability to realize gains on the sale of loans.\nIncreases in interest rates might cause depositors to shift funds from accounts that have a comparatively lower cost, such as regular savings accounts, to accounts with a higher cost, such as certificates of deposit. If the cost of interest-bearing deposits increases at a rate greater than the yields on interest-earning assets increase, our net interest income will be negatively affected. Changes in the asset and liability mix may also affect our net interest income.\nWe have adopted asset and liability management policies to mitigate the potential adverse effects of changes in interest rates on net interest income, primarily by altering the mix and maturity of loans, investments, funding sources, and derivatives. However, even with these policies in place, a change in interest rates can impact our results of operations or financial condition. While we actively manage against these risks through hedging and other risk management strategies, if our assumptions regarding borrower behavior are wrong or overall economic conditions are significantly different than anticipated, our risk management mitigation techniques may be insufficient.\nFor additional discussion on interest rate risk, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Asset/Liability Management and Interest Rate Risk.\u201d\nOur loan portfolio includes commercial loans, which are generally riskier than other types of loans.\nAt December 31, 2018, commercial loans represented 55% of our loan portfolio. Commercial loans generally carry larger loan balances and involve a higher risk of nonpayment or late payment than residential mortgage loans. These loans may lack standardized terms and may include a balloon payment feature. The ability of a borrower to make or refinance a balloon payment may be affected by a number of factors, including the financial condition of the borrower, prevailing economic conditions and prevailing interest rates. Repayment of these loans is generally more dependent on the economy and the successful operation of a business. Because of the risks associated with commercial loans, we may experience higher rates of default than if our portfolio were more heavily weighted toward residential mortgage loans. Higher rates of default could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our borrowers may default on their obligations. A borrower\u2019s default on its obligations under one or more loans may result in lost principal and interest income and increased operating expenses as a result of the allocation of management time and resources to the collection and work-out of the loan. In certain situations, where collection efforts are unsuccessful or acceptable work-out arrangements cannot be reached, we may have to write off the loan in whole or in part. In such situations, we may acquire real estate or other assets, if any, that secure the loan through foreclosure or other similar available remedies, and often the amount owed under the defaulted loan exceeds the value of the assets acquired.\nWe periodically make a determination of an allowance for loan losses based on available information, including, but not limited to, the quality and collectability of the loan portfolio, certain economic conditions, the value of the underlying collateral and the level of nonaccrual and criticized loans. We rely on our loan quality reviews, our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors, in determining the amount of provision required for the allowance for loan losses. Provisions to this allowance result in an expense for the period. If, as a result of general economic conditions, changes to previous assumptions, or an increase in defaulted loans, we determine that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses are necessary, we will incur additional expense.\nDetermining the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make various assumptions and judgments, all of which may undergo material changes. At any time, there are likely to be loans in our portfolio that will result in losses but that have not been identified as nonperforming or potential problem credits. We cannot be sure that we will be able to identify deteriorating credits before they become nonperforming assets or that we will be able to limit losses on those loans that are identified. We may be required to increase our allowance for loan losses for any of several reasons. Federal and state regulators, in reviewing our loan portfolio as part of a regulatory examination, may request that we increase our allowance for loan losses. Changes in economic conditions affecting\nborrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in our allowance for loan losses. In addition, if losses and/or charge-offs in future periods exceed our allowance for loan losses, we will need additional increases in our allowance for loan losses. Any increases in our allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in our net income and, possibly, our capital, and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFor a more detailed discussion on the allowance for loan losses, see additional information disclosed in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d\nEnvironmental liability associated with our lending activities could result in losses.\nIn the course of business, we may acquire, through foreclosure, properties securing loans we have originated that are in default. While we believe that our credit granting process incorporates appropriate procedures for the assessment of environmental contamination risk, there is a risk that material environmental violations could be discovered on these properties, particularly with respect to commercial loans secured by real estate. In this event, we might be required to remedy these violations at the affected properties at our sole cost and expense. The cost of this remedial action could substantially exceed the value of affected properties. We may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties. These events could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have credit and market risk inherent in our investment securities portfolio.\nWe maintain a securities portfolio, which includes obligations of U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and agencies, including mortgage-backed securities; obligations of states and political subdivisions; individual name issuer trust preferred debt securities; and corporate bonds. We seek to limit credit losses in our securities portfolios by generally purchasing only highly-rated securities. The valuation and liquidity of our securities could be adversely impacted by reduced market liquidity, increased normal bid-asked spreads and increased uncertainty of market participants, which could reduce the market value of our securities, even those with no apparent credit exposure. The valuation of our securities requires judgment and as market conditions change security values may also change.\nPotential downgrades of U.S. government agency and government-sponsored enterprise securities by one or more of the credit ratings agencies could have a material adverse effect on our operations, earnings and financial condition.\nA possible future downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government and a decline in the perceived creditworthiness of U.S. government-related obligations could impact our ability to obtain funding that is collateralized by affected instruments, as well as affect the pricing of that funding when it is available. A downgrade may also adversely affect the market value of such instruments. We cannot predict if, when or how any changes to the credit ratings or perceived creditworthiness of these organizations will affect economic conditions. Such ratings actions could result in a significant adverse impact on us. Among other things, a downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government could adversely impact the value of our investment securities portfolio and may trigger requirements to post additional collateral for trades relative to these securities. A downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government or the credit ratings of related institutions, agencies or instruments would significantly exacerbate the other risks to which we are subject and any related adverse effects on the business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry, and laws and regulations, or changes in them, could limit or restrict our activities and could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe are subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve, and the Bank and its various subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the FDIC, and the banking divisions or departments of states in which we are licensed to do business. Federal and state laws and regulations govern numerous matters affecting us, including changes in the ownership or control of banks and bank holding companies; maintenance of adequate capital and the financial condition of a financial institution; permissible types, amounts and terms of extensions of credit and investments; the manner in which we conduct mortgage banking activities; permissible non-banking activities; the level of reserves against deposits; and restrictions on dividend payments. The FDIC and the banking divisions or departments of states in which we are licensed to do business have the power to issue consent orders to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks subject to their regulation, and the Federal Reserve possesses similar powers with respect to bank holding companies. These and other restrictions limit the manner in which we may conduct business and obtain financing.\nThe laws, rules, regulations, and supervisory guidance and policies applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change. These changes could adversely and materially impact us. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies, or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by federal and state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. See \u201cBusiness-Supervision and Regulation.\u201d\nWe are subject to capital and liquidity standards that require banks and bank holding companies to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically been the case.\nWe became subject to new capital requirements in 2015. These new standards, which now apply and will be fully phased-in over the next several years, force bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially higher levels of capital as a percentage of their assets, with a greater emphasis on common equity as opposed to other components of capital. The need to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well as greater liquidity, and generally increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to capital levels, may at some point limit our business activities, including lending, and our ability to expand. It could also result in our being required to take steps to increase our regulatory capital and may dilute shareholder value or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to our investors through stock repurchases.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose community investment and nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act or other fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions, restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to a number of different counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, other commercial banks, investment banks, and other financial institutions. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by us or by other institutions and organizations. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or customer. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges to and replacement of the LIBOR Benchmark Interest Rate may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), a regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the United Kingdom, stated that it will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). The FCA has indicated that they will support the LIBOR interest rate indices through 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to alternative reference rates. Other financial services regulators and industry groups, including the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (\u201cISDA\u201d), are evaluating the possible phase-out of LIBOR and the development of alternate interest rate indices or reference rates. Accordingly, uncertainty as to the nature of such changes may adversely affect the market for or value of LIBOR-based loans, derivatives, investment securities and other financial obligations held by or due to Washington Trust, and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nLoss of deposits or a change in deposit mix could increase our cost of funding.\nDeposits are a low cost and stable source of funding. We compete with banks and other financial institutions for deposits. Funding costs may increase if we are forced to replace deposits with more expensive sources of funding, if clients shift their deposits into higher cost products or if we need to raise interest rates to avoid losing deposits. Higher funding costs reduce our net interest margin, net interest income and net income.\nMarket changes may adversely affect demand for our services and impact results of operations.\nChannels for servicing our customers are evolving rapidly, with less reliance on traditional branch facilities, more use of online and mobile banking, and increased demand for universal bankers and other relationship managers who can service multiple product lines. We compete with larger providers who are rapidly evolving their service channels and escalating the costs of evolving the service process. We have a process for evaluating the profitability of our branch system and other office and operational facilities. The identification of unprofitable operations and facilities can lead to restructuring charges and introduce the risk of disruptions to revenues and customer relationships.\nRisks Related to Our Wealth Management Business\nOur wealth management business is highly regulated, and the regulators have the ability to limit or restrict our activities and impose fines or suspensions on the conduct of our business.\nWe offer wealth management services through the Bank, Weston Financial and Halsey. Weston Financial and Halsey are registered investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act. The Investment Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary, record keeping, operational and disclosure obligations. We are also subject to the provisions and regulations of ERISA to the extent that we act as a \u201cfiduciary\u201d under ERISA with respect to certain of our clients. ERISA and the applicable provisions of the federal tax laws impose a number of duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of each ERISA plan which is a client, as well as certain transactions by the fiduciaries (and certain other related parties) to such plans. Investment contracts with institutional and other clients are typically terminable by the client, also without penalty, upon 30 to 60 days\u2019 notice. Changes in these laws or regulations could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and mode of operations.\nThe market value of wealth management assets under administration may be negatively affected by changes in economic and market conditions.\nRevenues from wealth management services represented 20% of our total revenues for 2018. A substantial portion of these fees are dependent on the market value of wealth management assets under administration, which are primarily marketable securities. Changes in domestic and foreign economic conditions, volatility in financial markets, and general trends in business and finance, all of which are beyond our control, could adversely impact the market value of these assets and the fee revenues derived from the management of these assets.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain wealth management clients.\nDue to strong competition, our wealth management business may not be able to attract and retain clients. Competition is strong because there are numerous well-established and successful investment management and wealth advisory firms including commercial banks and trust companies, investment advisory firms, mutual fund companies, stock brokerage firms, and other financial companies. Many of our competitors have greater resources than we have.\nOur ability to successfully attract and retain wealth management clients is dependent upon our ability to compete with competitors\u2019 investment products, level of investment performance, client services and marketing and distribution capabilities. If we are not successful, our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted.\nWealth management revenues are primarily derived from investment management, trustee and personal representative fees and financial planning services. Most of our investment management clients may withdraw funds from accounts under management generally at their sole discretion. Financial planning contracts are terminable upon relatively short notice. The financial performance of our wealth management business is a significant factor in our overall results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe face continuing and growing security risks to our information base, including the information we maintain relating to our customers.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our business and to store sensitive data, including financial information regarding customers. Our electronic communications and information systems infrastructure could be susceptible to cyberattacks, hacking, identity theft or terrorist activity. We have implemented and regularly review and update extensive systems of internal controls and procedures as well as corporate governance policies and procedures intended to protect our business operations, including the security and privacy of all confidential customer information. In addition, we rely on the services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs. No matter how well designed or implemented our controls are, we cannot provide an absolute guarantee to protect our business operations from every type of problem in every situation. A failure or circumvention of these controls could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.\nWe regularly assess and test our security systems and disaster preparedness, including back-up systems, but the risks are substantially escalating. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued enhancement of our controls and processes to protect our systems, data and networks from attacks, unauthorized access or significant damage remain a priority. Accordingly, we may be required to expend additional resources to enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or exposures. Any breach of our system security could result in disruption of our operations, unauthorized access to confidential customer information, significant regulatory costs, litigation exposure and other possible damages, loss or liability. Such costs or losses could exceed the amount of available insurance coverage, if any, and would adversely affect our earnings. Also, any failure to prevent a security breach or to quickly and effectively deal with such a breach could negatively impact customer confidence, damaging our reputation and undermining our ability to attract and keep customers.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and core application processing. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers or otherwise conduct our business efficiently and effectively. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement future information technology system enhancements, which could adversely affect our business operations and profitability.\nWe invest significant resources in information technology system enhancements in order to provide functionality and security at an appropriate level. We may not be able to successfully implement and integrate future system enhancements, which could adversely impact the ability to provide timely and accurate financial information in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, which could result in sanctions from regulatory authorities. Such sanctions could include fines and suspension of trading in our stock, among others. In addition, future system enhancements could have higher than expected costs and/or result in operating inefficiencies, which could increase the costs associated with the implementation as well as ongoing operations.\nFailure to properly utilize system enhancements that are implemented in the future could result in impairment charges that adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and could result in significant costs to remediate or replace the defective components. In addition, we may incur significant training, licensing, maintenance, consulting and amortization expenses during and after systems implementations, and any such costs may continue for an extended period of time.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively in our increasingly competitive industry.\nWe compete with larger bank and non-bank financial institutions for loans and deposits in the communities we serve, and we may face even greater competition in the future due to legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Many of our competitors have significantly greater resources and lending limits than we have. Banks and other financial services firms can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service. In addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automated transfer and automatic payment\nsystems. Many competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures than we do. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can. Our long-term success depends on our ability to compete successfully with other financial institutions in our service areas.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry can be intense and we may not be able to hire or retain the key personnel that we depend upon for success. Certain key personnel that have regular direct contact with customers and clients often build strong relationships that are important to our business. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of the markets in which we operate, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. Also, the loss of key personnel could jeopardize our relationships with customers and clients and could lead to the loss of accounts. Losses of such accounts could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nDamage to our reputation could significantly harm our business, including our competitive position and business prospects.\nWe are dependent on our reputation within our market area, as a trusted and responsible financial services company, for all aspects of our business with customers, employees, vendors, third-party service providers, and others, with whom we conduct business or potential future businesses. Our ability to attract and retain customers and employees could be adversely affected if our reputation is damaged. Our actual or perceived failure to address various issues could give rise to reputational risk that could cause harm to us and our business prospects. These issues also include, but are not limited to, legal and regulatory requirements; properly maintaining customer and employee personal information; record keeping; money-laundering; sales and trading practices; ethical issues; appropriately addressing potential conflicts of interest; and the proper identification of the legal, reputational, credit, liquidity and market risks inherent in our products. Failure to appropriately address any of these issues could also give rise to additional regulatory restrictions and legal risks, which could, among other consequences, increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions, fines and penalties and cause us to incur related costs and expenses. Furthermore, any damage to our reputation could affect our ability to retain and develop the business relationships necessary to conduct business, which in turn could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and the market price of our common stock.\nWe face significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against us.\nFrom time to time we are named as a defendant or are otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. There is no assurance that litigation with private parties will not increase in the future. Actions currently pending against us may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to us, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm to us. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that we will continue to experience litigation related to our businesses and operations.\nOur businesses and operations are also subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. These and other initiatives from federal and state officials may subject us to further judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause us to be required to restructure our operations and activities, all of which could lead to reputational issues, or higher operational costs, thereby reducing our profitability.\nWe may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even inadvertent or unintentional violations.\nThe financial services industry is subject to intense scrutiny from bank supervisors in the examination process and aggressive enforcement of federal and state regulations, particularly with respect to mortgage-related practices and other consumer compliance matters, and compliance with anti-money laundering, Bank Secrecy Act and Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations, and economic sanctions against certain foreign countries and nationals. Enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. We maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations; however, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there were systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance in place\nat the time. Failure to comply with these and other regulations, and supervisory expectations related thereto, may result in fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions, reputation damage, or restrictions on our business.\nNatural disasters, acts of terrorism and other external events could harm our business.\nNatural disasters can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties, reduce or destroy the value of the collateral for our loans and negatively affect the economies in which we operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. A significant natural disaster, such as a tornado, hurricane, earthquake, fire or flood, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate for losses that may occur. Acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest, violence or human error could cause disruptions to our business or the economy as a whole. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Liquidity\nWe are subject to liquidity risk.\nLiquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. Our liquidity is used principally to originate or purchase loans, to repay deposit liabilities and other liabilities when they come due, and to fund operating costs. Customer demand for non-maturity deposits can be difficult to predict. Changes in market interest rates, increased competition within our markets, and other factors may make deposit gathering more difficult. Disruptions in the capital markets or interest rate changes may make the terms of wholesale funding sources, which include FHLB advances, brokered time certificates of deposit, federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, less favorable and may make it difficult to sell securities when needed to provide additional liquidity. As a result, there is a risk that the cost of funding will increase or that we will not have sufficient funds to meet our obligations when they come due.\nPotential deterioration in the performance or financial position of the FHLB might restrict our funding needs and may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant components of our liquidity needs are met through our access to funding pursuant to our membership in the FHLB. The FHLB is a cooperative that provides services to its member banking institutions. The primary reason for joining the FHLB is to obtain funding. The purchase of stock in the FHLB is a requirement for a member to gain access to funding. Any deterioration in the FHLB\u2019s performance or financial condition may affect our ability to access funding and/or require Washington Trust to deem the required investment in FHLB stock to be impaired. If we are not able to access funding through the FHLB, we may not be able to meet our liquidity needs, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Similarly, if we deem all or part of our investment in FHLB stock impaired, such action could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are a holding company and depend on the Bank for dividends, distributions and other payments.\nThe Bancorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Revenues of the Bancorp are derived primarily from dividends paid to it by the Bank. The right of the Bancorp, and consequently the right of shareholders of the Bancorp, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of the Bank, through the payment of such dividends or otherwise, is necessarily subject to the prior claims of creditors of the Bank (including depositors), except to the extent that certain claims of the Bancorp in a creditor capacity may be recognized.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and our Board of Directors may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. The Federal Reserve has authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if such payment is deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice. Additionally, the FDIC has the authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit a bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Further, our ability to pay dividends would be restricted if we do not maintain a capital conservation buffer. A reduction or elimination of dividends could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. See Item, \u201cBusiness-Supervision and Regulation-Dividend Restrictions\u201d and \u201cBusiness-Supervision and Regulation-Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness-Regulatory Capital Requirements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Valuation Matters and Changes in Accounting Standards\nIf we are required to write-down goodwill or other intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisitions, our profitability would be negatively impacted.\nApplicable accounting standards require us to use the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations. Under purchase accounting, if the purchase price of an acquired company exceeds the fair value of the company\u2019s net assets, the excess is carried on the acquirer\u2019s balance sheet as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill must be evaluated for impairment at least annually. Long-lived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. A significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization, a significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or other factors could result in impairment of goodwill. Write-downs of the amount of any impairment, if necessary, would be charged to the results of operations in the period in which the impairment occurs. There can be no assurance that future evaluations of goodwill or intangible assets will not result in findings of impairment and related write-downs, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe performance of our securities portfolio in difficult market conditions could have adverse effects on our results of operations.\nUnder applicable accounting standards, we are required to review our securities portfolio periodically for the presence of other-than-temporary impairment, taking into consideration current market conditions, the extent and nature of changes in fair value, issuer rating changes and trends, volatility of earnings, current analysts\u2019 evaluations, our ability and intent to hold securities until a recovery of fair value, as well as other factors. Adverse developments with respect to one or more of the foregoing factors may require us to deem particular securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired, with the credit related portion of the reduction in the value recognized as a charge to the results of operations in the period in which the impairment occurs. Market volatility may make it difficult to value certain securities. Subsequent valuations, in light of factors prevailing at that time, may result in significant changes in the values of these securities in future periods. Any of these factors could require us to recognize further impairments in the value of our securities portfolio, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods.\nChanges in accounting standards can materially impact our financial statements.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) or regulatory authorities change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. Such changes are expected to continue and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements. Additionally, significant changes to accounting standards may require costly technology changes, additional training and personnel, and other expense that will negatively impact our results of operations.\nIn 2016, the FASB released a new accounting standard for determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses. The new accounting standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2020 and will be a significant change from the accounting standard in place today. The new accounting standard requires the allowance for credit losses to be calculated based on current expected credit losses (commonly referred to as the \"CECL model\") rather than losses inherent in the portfolio as of a point in time. When adopted, the CECL model will likely increase our allowance for loan losses and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and future results of operations. The extent of the increase and its impact to our financial condition is under evaluation, but will ultimately depend upon the nature and characteristics of our portfolio at the adoption date, and the economic conditions and forecasts at that date; therefore, the potential financial impact is currently unknown.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations and differences in interpretation of tax laws and regulations may adversely impact our financial statements.\nWe are subject to tax law changes that could impact our effective income tax rate and our net deferred tax assets. Tax law changes may or may not be retroactive to previous periods and could negatively affect our current and future financial performance. Our net deferred tax assets are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nIn 2017, Congress enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d), which has had both positive and negative effects on\nour financial performance. The enactment of the Tax Act required a revaluation of our net deferred tax assets in light of the new federal income tax rate This had an adverse impact to our financial performance in 2017, as we recognized a write-down of $6.2 million in our net deferred tax assets, with a corresponding increase to income tax expense. Beginning in 2018, the Tax Act reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and also enacted limitations on certain deductions, resulting in a net decrease in our effective income tax rate. Furthermore, changes in interpretations, guidance or regulations that may be promulgated, or actions that we may take as a result of the Tax Act could negatively impact our business. Similarly, our customers are likely to experience varying effects from both the individual and business tax provisions of the Tax Act and such effects, whether positive or negative, may have a corresponding impact on our financial performance and the economy as a whole.\nLocal, state or federal tax authorities may interpret tax laws and regulations differently than we do and challenge tax positions that we have taken on tax returns. This may result in differences in the treatment of revenues, deductions, credits and/or differences in the timing of these items. The differences in treatment may result in payment of additional taxes, interest, penalties, or litigation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our results.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock is not insured by any governmental entity.\nOur common stock is not a deposit account or other obligation of any bank and is not insured by the FDIC or any other governmental entity.\nThe market price and trading volume of our stock can be volatile.\nThe price of our common stock can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. We cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly. Some of the factors that could cause fluctuations or declines in the price of our common stock include, but are not limited to, actual or anticipated variations in reported operating results, recommendations by securities analysts, the level of trading activity in our common stock, new services or delivery systems offered by competitors, business combinations involving our competitors, operating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem to be comparable to Washington Trust, news reports relating to trends or developments in the credit, mortgage and housing markets as well as the financial services industry, and changes in government regulations.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed.\nAs a bank holding company, we are required by regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. We may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial performance. We cannot assure you that such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our inability to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could subject us to certain activity restrictions or to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the regulatory authorities, including limitations on our ability to pay dividends or pursue acquisitions, the issuance by regulatory authorities of a capital directive to increase capital and the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation may have an anti-takeover effect.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation and regulations and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders. The combination of these provisions may inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 11397, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "WASH"}
