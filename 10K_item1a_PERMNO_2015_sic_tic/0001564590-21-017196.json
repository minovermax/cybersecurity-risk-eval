Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report, before making a decision to invest in our securities. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nYou should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. As a result of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, our actual results or performance may be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include:\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the Business Combination Agreements;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the Company, UpHealth, Cloudbreak or others following announcement of the Business Combinations and the transactions contemplated in the Business Combination Agreements;\n\u2022\nthe inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreements due to the failure to obtain approval of the equity holders of the Company, UpHealth or Cloudbreak or other conditions to closing in the Business Combination Agreements;\n\u2022\nthe ability to obtain or maintain the listing of New UpHealth Common Stock on the NYSE following the Business Combinations;\n\u2022\nthe risk that the proposed transaction disrupts current plans and operations as a result of the announcement and consummation of the Business Combinations;\n\u2022\nthe ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the Business Combinations, which may be affected by, among other things, the ability of the Company to grow and manage growth profitably, maintain relationships with customers, compete within its industry and retain its key employees;\n\u2022\ncosts related to the proposed Business Combinations;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nthe effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on New UpHealth\u2019s business;\n\u2022\nthe ability of New UpHealth to execute its business model, including market acceptance of its planned products and services and achieving sufficient production volumes at acceptable quality levels and prices;\n\u2022\nNew UpHealth\u2019s ability to raise capital;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that the Company, UpHealth or Cloudbreak may be adversely impacted by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors;\n\u2022\nfuture exchange and interest rates; and\n\u2022\nother risks and uncertainties indicated in this proxy statement/prospectus, including those under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this proxy statement/prospectus, and other filings that have been made or will be made with the SEC by the Company.\nShould one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.\nThe Company has no operating history and is subject to a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution requirement. If the Company is unable to consummate a business combination, including the Business Combinations, its public stockholders may be forced to wait until after June 10, 2021 (or such later date as may arise if we amend our certificate of incorporation again to further extend the time that we have to consummate a business combination) before receiving distributions from the Trust Account.\nThe Company is a development stage blank check company, and as it has no operating history and is subject to a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution requirement. The Company has until June 10, 2021 to complete a business combination, unless we amend our certificate of incorporation again to further extend the time that we have to consummate a business combination. The Company has no obligation to return funds to investors prior to such date unless (i) it consummates a business combination prior thereto or (ii) it seeks to amend its current amended and restated certificate of corporation prior to consummation of a business combination, and only then in cases where investors have sought to convert or sell their shares to the Company. Only after the expiration of this full time period will public security holders be entitled to distributions from the Trust Account if the Company is unable to complete a business combination. Accordingly, investors\u2019 funds may be unavailable to them until after such date and to liquidate their investment, public security holders may be forced to sell their public shares, rights or warrants, potentially at a loss. In addition, if the Company fails to complete an initial business combination by June 10, 2021 (or such later date as may arise if we amend our certificate of incorporation again to further extend the time that we have to consummate a business combination), there will be no Redemption Rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the rights and warrants, which will expire worthless, unless the Company amends its certificate of incorporation to extend its life and certain other agreements it has entered into.\nWe have no operating or financial history and our results of operations and those of the post-combination company may differ significantly from the unaudited pro forma financial data included in the Registration Statement on Form S-4/A filed with the SEC on March 23, 2021.\nWe are a blank check company and we have no operating history and no revenues. The Registration Statement on Form S-4/A filed with the SEC on March 23, 2021 includes unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements for the post-combination company. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations of the post-combination company combines the historical audited results of operations of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2020, with the historical audited results of operations of UpHealth and Cloudbreak for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, and gives pro forma effect to the Business Combinations as if it had been consummated on January 1, 2020. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet of the post-combination company combines the historical balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020, of UpHealth as of December 31, 2020 and of Cloudbreak as of December 31, 2020 and gives pro forma effect to the Business Combinations as if it had been consummated on December 31, 2020.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only, are based on certain assumptions, address a hypothetical situation and reflect limited historical financial data. Therefore, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations and financial position that would have been achieved had the Business Combinations and the acquisitions of UpHealth and Cloudbreak been consummated on the dates indicated above, or the future consolidated results of operations or financial position of the post-combination company. Accordingly, the post-combination company\u2019s business, assets, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition may differ significantly from those indicated by the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements included in this document.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will be subject to income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions, and our tax liabilities will be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nexpected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;\n\u2022\ntax effects of stock-based compensation;\n\u2022\ncosts related to intercompany restructurings;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; or\n\u2022\nlower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by taxing authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to complete an initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share on the liquidation of the Trust Account (or less than $10.00 per share in certain circumstances where a third party brings a claim against us that our Sponsor is unable to indemnify), and our warrants will expire worthless.\nIf we are unable to complete an initial business combination by the applicable deadline, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share on the liquidation of the Trust Account (or less than $10.00 per share in certain circumstances where a third-party brings a claim against us that our Sponsor is unable to indemnify (as described herein)) and our warrants will expire worthless.\nFollowing the consummation of the Business Combinations, our only significant asset will be our ownership interest in New UpHealth and such ownership may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable us to pay any dividends on our Common Stock or satisfy our other financial obligations.\nFollowing the consummation of the Business Combinations, we will have no direct operations and no significant assets other than our ownership of UpHealth and Cloudbreak. The UpHealth equity holders, the Cloudbreak equity holders, the directors and officers of UpHealth and the directors and officers of Cloudbreak and their respective affiliates will become stockholders of the post-combination company at that time. We will depend on UpHealth and Cloudbreak for distributions, loans and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations, including our expenses as a publicly traded company and to pay any dividends with respect to our Common Stock. The financial condition and operating requirements of UpHealth and Cloudbreak may limit our ability to obtain cash from UpHealth or Cloudbreak. The earnings from, or other available assets of, UpHealth or Cloudbreak may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable us to pay any dividends on our Common Stock or satisfy our other financial obligations.\nThe ability of UpHealth or Cloudbreak to make distributions, loans and other payments to us for the purposes described above and for any other purpose may be limited by credit agreements to which UpHealth or Cloudbreak is party from time to time, including existing loans and security agreements described in \u201cTTC Healthcare\u2019s Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d, and \u201cCloudbreak\u2019s Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and will be subject to the negative covenants set forth therein. Any loans or other extensions of credit to us from UpHealth or Cloudbreak will be permitted only to the extent there is an applicable exception to the investment covenants under these credit agreements. Similarly, any dividends, distributions or similar payments to us from UpHealth or Cloudbreak will be permitted only to the extent there is an applicable exception to the dividends and distributions covenants under these credit agreements.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on shares of Common Stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your shares of Common Stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe may retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends as a public company in the future will be made at the discretion of the Company\u2019s Board and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that the Board may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in the Company\u2019s Common Stock unless you sell your Common Stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nThere can be no assurance that New UpHealth Common Stock will be approved for listing on the NYSE or that New UpHealth will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of NYSE.\nIn connection with the closing of the Business Combinations, we intend to list New UpHealth\u2019s Common Stock and warrants on the NYSE under the symbols \u201cUPH\u201d and \u201cUPH.WS,\u201d respectively. New UpHealth\u2019s continued eligibility for listing may depend on the number of the Company\u2019s shares that are redeemed. If, after the Business Combinations, the NYSE delists New UpHealth\u2019s shares from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards, New UpHealth and its stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences including:\n\u2022\na limited availability of market quotations for New UpHealth\u2019s securities;\n\u2022\na determination that New UpHealth Common Stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in New UpHealth Common Stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for shares of New UpHealth Common Stock;\n\u2022\na limited amount of analyst coverage; and\n\u2022\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $168,384,949 in cash held in trust. As of March 10, 2021, the cash held in trust was reduced to $149,604,108 as a result of redemptions in conjunction with the Special Meeting held on March 10, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had a working capital deficit of $2,012,409. Further, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans, including the Business Combination Agreements. The Company cannot assure you that its plans to raise capital or to consummate an initial business combination, including the Business Combination Agreements, will be successful. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report do not include any adjustments that might result from its inability to consummate the Business Combinations or its inability to continue as a going concern.\nSubsequent to the consummation of the Business Combinations, the post-combination company may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on its financial condition, results of operations and stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nAlthough the Company has conducted due diligence on UpHealth and Cloudbreak, the Company cannot assure you that this diligence revealed all material issues that may be present in UpHealth\u2019s or Cloudbreak\u2019s business, as applicable, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of the Company\u2019s, UpHealth\u2019s and Cloudbreak\u2019s control will not later arise. As a result, the post-combination company may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure its operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Even if the Company\u2019s due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with the Company\u2019s preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and may not have an immediate impact on the post-combination company\u2019s liquidity, the fact that the post-combination company reports charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about it or its securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause the post-combination company to be unable to obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all.\nFollowing the consummation of the Business Combinations, New UpHealth will incur significant increased expenses and administrative burdens as a public company, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFollowing the consummation of the Business Combinations, New UpHealth will face increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses as a public company that UpHealth and Cloudbreak do not incur as private companies. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), including the requirements of Section 404, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the rules and regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder, Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d) and the securities exchanges, impose additional reporting and other obligations on public companies. Compliance with public company requirements will increase costs and make certain activities more time-consuming. A number of those requirements will require New UpHealth to carry out activities neither UpHealth nor Cloudbreak has not done previously. For example, New UpHealth will create new board committees and adopt new internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. In addition, expenses associated with SEC reporting requirements will be incurred. Furthermore, if any issues in complying with those requirements are identified (for example, if the auditors identify a material weakness or significant deficiency in the internal control over financial reporting), New UpHealth could incur additional costs rectifying those issues, and the existence of those issues could adversely affect New UpHealth\u2019s reputation or investor perceptions of it. It may also be more expensive to obtain director and officer liability insurance. Risks associated with New UpHealth\u2019s status as a public company may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on the New UpHealth Board or as executive officers. The additional reporting and other obligations imposed by these rules and regulations will increase legal and financial compliance costs and the costs of related legal, accounting and administrative activities. These increased costs will require New UpHealth to divert a significant amount of money that could otherwise be used to expand the business and achieve strategic objectives. Advocacy efforts by stockholders and third parties may also prompt additional changes in governance and reporting requirements, which could further increase costs.\nThe Initial Stockholders have agreed to vote in favor of the Business Combinations, regardless of how the Company\u2019s public stockholders vote.\nUnlike some other blank check companies in which the initial stockholders agree to vote their Founder shares in accordance with the majority of the votes cast by the public stockholders in connection with an initial business combination, the Initial Stockholders have agreed (i) to vote their shares in favor of any proposed business combination, including the Business Combinations, (ii) not to convert their shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination, and (iii) not to sell any such shares to the Company in a tender offer in connection with any proposed business combination. Our Initial Stockholders have agreed to vote their shares in favor of each of the UpHealth Business Combination Proposal and the Cloudbreak Business Combination Proposal. As a result, we would need only 4,911,158, or approximately 33%, of the 14,817,315 public shares, to be voted in favor of the Business Combination Agreements in order to have the Business Combinations approved. Accordingly, it is more likely that the necessary stockholder approval will be received than would be the case if the Initial Stockholders agreed to vote their Founder Shares and Private Placement Shares in accordance with the majority of the votes cast by the Company\u2019s public stockholders.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included in the Registration Statement on Form S-4/A filed with the SEC on March 23, 2021 may not be indicative of what the Company\u2019s actual financial position or results of operations would have been.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information in the Registration Statement on Form S-4/A filed with the SEC on March 23, 2021 is presented solely for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what the Company\u2019s actual financial position or results of operations would have been had the Business Combinations completed on the dates indicated.\nIf third parties bring claims against the Company, the proceeds held in trust could be reduced and the per-share redemption price received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share.\nThe Company\u2019s placing of funds in trust may not protect those funds from third party claims against the Company. Although the Company has sought to have all vendors and service providers the Company engages and prospective target businesses the Company negotiated with execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of the Company\u2019s public stockholders, they may not execute such agreements. Furthermore, even if such entities execute such agreements with the Company, they may seek recourse against the Trust Account. A court may not uphold the validity of such agreements. Accordingly, the proceeds held in trust could be subject to claims which could take priority over those of the Company\u2019s public stockholders. If the Company is unable to complete a business combination and distribute the proceeds held in trust to the Company\u2019s public stockholders, the Sponsor has agreed (subject to certain exceptions described elsewhere in this Annual Report) that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the Trust Account are not reduced below $10.00 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by the Company for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to the Company. However, it may not be able to meet such obligation. Therefore, the per-share distribution from the Trust Account may be less than $10.00, plus interest, due to such claims.\nAdditionally, if the Company is forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against the Company\u2019s which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in the Company\u2019s bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of the Company\u2019s stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, the Company may not be able to return to the Company\u2019s public stockholders at least $10.00. The Sponsor may not have sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations, as its only assets are securities of the Company. The Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the Trust Account, the funds available for the Company\u2019s initial business combination, including the Business Combinations, and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share.\nOur directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our Sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the Trust Account available for distribution to our public stockholders.\nIn the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary duties may choose not to do so in any particular instance if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the Trust Account available for distribution to our public stockholders may be reduced below $10.00 per share.\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our stockholders and the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.\nIf, after we distribute the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and we and our Board may be exposed to claims of punitive damages.\nIf, after we distribute the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent conveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. In addition, our Board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors.\nThe Company\u2019s stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against the Company to the extent of distributions received by them.\nThe Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation provides that it will continue in existence only until June 10, 2021, unless we amend our certificate of incorporation again to further extend the time that we have to consummate a business combination. If the Company has not completed a business combination by such date, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account net of interest that may be used by the Company to pay its franchise and income taxes payable and up to $100,000 for dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders\u2019 rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company\u2019s remaining stockholders and our Board,\ndissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of(ii) and (iii) above) to the Company\u2019s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.\nIf the Company is forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against the Company which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent conveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by the Company\u2019s stockholders. Furthermore, because GigCapital2 intends to distribute the proceeds held in the public shares to the Company\u2019s public stockholders promptly after expiration of the time the Company has to complete an initial business combination, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to the Company\u2019s public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from the Company\u2019s assets. Furthermore, our Board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to the Company\u2019s creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and the Company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. The Company cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against it for these reasons.\nNeither the Company nor its stockholders will have the protection of any indemnification, escrow, price adjustment or other provisions that allow for a post-closing adjustment to be made to the total aggregate closing consideration in the event that any of the representations and warranties made by UpHealth or Cloudbreak in the Business Combinations, as applicable, ultimately proves to be inaccurate or incorrect.\nThe representations and warranties made by UpHealth, Cloudbreak and the Company to each other in the Business Combination Agreements will not survive the consummation of the Business Combinations. As a result, the Company and its stockholders will not have the protection of any indemnification, escrow, price adjustment or other provisions that allow for a post-closing adjustment to be made to the total merger consideration if any representation or warranty made by UpHealth in the UpHealth Business Combination Agreement and Cloudbreak in the Cloudbreak Business Combination Agreement proves to be inaccurate or incorrect. Accordingly, to the extent such representations or warranties are incorrect, the Company would have no indemnification claim with respect thereto and its financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nGigCapital2 may not have sufficient funds to satisfy indemnification claims of its directors and executive officers.\nGigCapital2 has agreed to indemnify its officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law. However, GigCapital2\u2019s officers and directors have agreed to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account and not to seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason whatsoever. Accordingly, any indemnification provided will be able to be satisfied by GigCapital2 only if (i) GigCapital2 has sufficient funds outside of the Trust Account or (ii) GigCapital2 consummates an initial business combination. GigCapital2\u2019s obligation to indemnify its officers and directors may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against its officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against GigCapital2\u2019s officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit GigCapital2 and its stockholders. Furthermore, a stockholder\u2019s investment may be adversely affected to the extent GigCapital2 pays the costs of settlement and damage awards against its officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions.\nIf the Company does not file and maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, holders will only be able to exercise such warrants on a \u201ccashless basis.\u201d\nIf the Company does not file and maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants at the time that holders wish to exercise such warrants, they will only be able to exercise them on a \u201ccashless basis\u201d provided that an exemption from registration is available. As a result, the number of shares of Common Stock that holders will receive upon exercise of the warrants will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised its warrant for cash. Further, if an exemption from registration is not available, holders would not be able to exercise on a cashless basis and would only be able to exercise their warrants for cash if a current and effective prospectus relating to the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is\navailable. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, the Company has agreed to use its best efforts to meet these conditions and to file and maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants. However, the Company cannot assure you that it will be able to do so. If the Company is unable to do so, the potential \u201cupside\u201d of the holder\u2019s investment in the Company may be reduced or the warrants may expire worthless.\nEven if the Company consummates the Business Combinations, there is no guarantee that the warrants will ever be in the money, and they may expire worthless and the terms of warrants may be amended.\nThe exercise price for the warrants is $11.50 per share of Common Stock. There is no guarantee that the public warrants will ever be in the money prior to their expiration, and as such, the warrants may expire worthless.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s warrants were issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and the Company. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants to make any other change. Accordingly, the Company may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment. Although the Company\u2019s ability to amend the terms of the warrants with the consent of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares and their respective affiliates and associates have of Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant.\nThe exercise price for our public warrants is higher than in many similar blank check company offerings in the past, and, accordingly, the public warrants are more likely to expire worthless.\nThe exercise price of our public warrants is higher than is typical with many similar blank check companies in the past. Historically, with regard to units offered by blank check companies, the exercise price of a public warrant was generally a fraction of the purchase price of the units in the initial public offering. The exercise price for our public warrants is $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as provided herein. As a result, the public warrants are less likely to ever be in the money and more likely to expire worthless.\nThe Company may amend the terms of the rights in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding rights.\nThe rights are issued in registered form under a right agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as rights agent, and the Company. The right agreement provides that the terms of the rights may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision. The right agreement requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding rights in order to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders.\nWarrants will become exercisable for our Common Stock, which would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.\nOur public warrants are exercisable for 17,250,000 shares of Common Stock as part of our IPO at $11.50 per share. The additional shares of our Common Stock issued upon exercise of our warrants will result in dilution to the then existing holders of Common Stock of the Company and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nStockholders may not know immediately after the Special Meeting whether we have satisfied the closing condition that the Trust Account equal or exceed $150,000,000.\nIf we receive valid redemption requests from holders of public shares prior to the redemption deadline, we may, at our sole discretion, following the redemption deadline and until the Closing Date, seek and permit withdrawals by one or more of such holders of their redemption requests. We may select which holders to seek such\nwithdrawals of redemption requests from based on any factors we may deem relevant, and the purpose of seeking such withdrawals may be to increase the funds held in the trust account, including where we otherwise would not satisfy the closing condition that the amount of cash or cash equivalents that we have from any source equals or exceeds $150,000,000. This process could take a number of days, and there may be a period of time after the special meeting and before the Closing when stockholders do not know whether we have satisfied this closing condition.\nThe Company has no obligation to net cash settle the rights or warrants.\nIn no event will the Company have any obligation to net cash settle the rights or warrants. Furthermore, there are no contractual penalties for failure to deliver securities to the holders of the rights or warrants upon consummation of an initial business combination, including the Business Combinations, or exercise of the warrants. Accordingly, the rights and Warrants may expire worthless.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to successfully effect the Business Combinations and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of its key personnel, including each of UpHealth\u2019s and Cloudbreak\u2019s key personnel, all of whom are expected to join the Company following the Business Combinations. While the Company intends to closely scrutinize any individuals it engages after the Business Combinations, it cannot assure you that its assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to successfully effect the Business Combinations is dependent upon the efforts of key personnel of UpHealth, Cloudbreak and of the Company, including Dr. Avi Katz, the Company\u2019s Executive Chairman Dr. Chirinjeev Kathuria, Executive Chairman of UpHealth, Dr. Mariya Pylypiv, Vice Chairwoman of UpHealth, Ramesh Balakrishnan and Al Gatmaitan, UpHealth\u2019s Co-Chief Executive Officers and Jamey Edwards, Cloudbreak\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. Although the Company expects all of UpHealth\u2019s and Cloudbreak\u2019s key personnel to remain with the post-combination company following the Business Combinations, it is possible that the post-combination company will lose some key personnel, the loss of which could negatively impact the operations and profitability of the post-combination company. While the post-combination company intends to closely scrutinize any individuals it engages after the Business Combinations, it cannot assure you that its assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a public company which could cause the post-combination company to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements. This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues which may adversely affect its operations.\nThe Company, UpHealth and Cloudbreak will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Business Combinations are pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Business Combinations on employees and third parties may have an adverse effect on the Company, UpHealth and Cloudbreak. These uncertainties may impair our, UpHealth\u2019s or Cloudbreak\u2019s ability to retain and motivate key personnel and could cause third parties that deal with any of us or them to defer entering into contracts or making other decisions or seek to change existing business relationships. If key employees depart because of uncertainty about their future roles and the potential complexities of the Business Combination, our, UpHealth\u2019s or Cloudbreak\u2019s business could be harmed.\nWe may waive one or more of the conditions to the Business Combinations.\nWe may agree to waive, in whole or in part, one or more of the conditions to our obligations to complete the Business Combinations, to the extent permitted by our current amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and applicable laws. In addition, if any of the proposed acquisitions or Business Combinations fails to occur, but our stockholders have approved the Business Combinations, we may decide to waive a condition or proceed with the rest of the Business Combinations without resoliciting stockholder. We may not waive the condition that our stockholders approve the Business Combinations.\nThe exercise of discretion by our directors and officers in agreeing to changes to the terms of or waivers of closing conditions in the Business Combination Agreements may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether such changes to the terms of the Business Combination Agreements or waivers of conditions are appropriate and in the best interests of our stockholders.\nIn the period leading up to the Closing, other events may occur that, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreements, would require the Company to agree to further amend the UpHealth Business Combination Agreement and amend the Cloudbreak Business Combination Agreement to consent to certain actions or to waive rights that we are entitled to under those agreements. Such events could arise because of changes in the course of UpHealth\u2019s business, Cloudbreak\u2019s business, a request by UpHealth to undertake actions that would otherwise be prohibited by the terms of the UpHealth Business Combination Agreement, a request by Cloudbreak to undertake actions that would otherwise be prohibited by the terms of the Cloudbreak Business Combination Agreement or the occurrence of other events that would have a material adverse effect on UpHealth\u2019s or Cloudbreak\u2019s business and would entitle the Company to terminate the Business Combination Agreements, as applicable. In any of such circumstances, it would be in the discretion of the Company, acting through the Board, to grant its consent or waive its rights. The existence of the financial and personal interests of the directors described elsewhere in this Annual Report may result in a conflict of interest on the part of one or more of the directors between what he or she may believe is best for the Company and our stockholders and what he or she may believe is best for himself or herself or his or her affiliates in determining whether or not to take the requested action. As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not believe there will be any changes or waivers that our directors and officers would be likely to make after stockholder approval of the Business Combinations has been obtained. While certain changes could be made without further stockholder approval, if there is a change to the terms of the Business Combinations that would have a material impact on the stockholders, we will be required to circulate a new or amended proxy statement or supplement thereto and resolicit the vote of our stockholders with respect to the UpHealth Business Combination Proposal and the Cloudbreak Business Combination Proposal, as applicable.\nWe, UpHealth and Cloudbreak will incur significant transaction and transition costs in connection with the Business Combinations.\nWe, UpHealth and Cloudbreak have both incurred and expect to incur significant, non-recurring costs in connection with consummating the Business Combinations and operating as a public company following the consummation of the Business Combinations. We, UpHealth and Cloudbreak may also incur additional costs to retain key employees. All expenses incurred in connection with the Business Combination Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby (including the Business Combinations), including all legal, accounting, consulting, investment banking and other fees, expenses and costs, will be for the account of the party incurring such fees, expenses and costs or paid by the Company following the Closing.\nThe aggregate transaction expenses as a result of the Business Combinations are expected to be approximately $43,000,000. The per-share amount we will distribute to stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be reduced by the transaction expenses and after such redemptions, the per-share value of shares held by non-redeeming stockholders will reflect our obligation to pay the transaction expenses.\nOur Sponsor, certain members of our Board and our officers have interests in the Business Combinations that are different from or are in addition to other stockholders in recommending that stockholders vote in favor of approval of the UpHealth Business Combination Proposal and the Cloudbreak Business Combination Proposal and approval of the other proposals described in this Annual Report.\nWhen considering our Board\u2019s recommendation that our stockholders vote in favor of the approval of the UpHealth Business Combination Proposal and the Cloudbreak Business Combination Proposal, our stockholders should be aware that the directors and officers of the Company have interests in the Business Combinations that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders. These interests include:\n\u2022\nthe fact that our Initial Stockholders have agreed not to redeem any of the Founder Shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve the Business Combinations;\n\u2022\nthe fact that our Initial Stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Founder Shares if we fail to complete an initial business combination by the applicable deadline;\n\u2022\nif the Trust Account is liquidated, including in the event we are unable to complete an initial business combination within the required time period, our Sponsor has agreed to indemnify us to ensure that the proceeds in the Trust Account are not reduced below $10.00 per public share, or such lesser per public share amount as is in the Trust Account on the liquidation date, by the claims of prospective target businesses with which we have entered into an acquisition agreement or claims of any third party (other than our independent public accountants) for services rendered or products sold to us, but only if such a vendor or target business has not executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account;\n\u2022\nthe continued indemnification of our existing directors and officers and the continuation of our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance after the Business Combinations;\n\u2022\nthe fact that Dr. Avi Katz, Dr. Raluca Dinu and Neil Miotto will remain as board members of the post-combination company and each shall be entitled to receive compensation for serving on the board of directors of the post-combination company;\n\u2022\nthe fact that we engaged the underwriters of our IPO as advisors to assist it in holding meetings with our stockholders to discuss potential business combination, introduce GigCapital2 to potential investors that are interested in purchasing our securities in connection with a potential business combination, assist it in obtaining stockholder approval for the business combination and assist us with our press releases and public filings in connection with a business combination. Pursuant to that agreement, we will pay the underwriters a cash fee for such services upon the consummation of the Business Combinations in an amount equal to, in the aggregate, 3.5% of the gross proceeds of the IPO, including any proceeds from the exercise of the over-allotment option; and\n\u2022\nthe fact that our Sponsor, officers and directors will lose their entire investment in us if an initial business combination is not consummated by the applicable deadline. Prior to GigCapital2\u2019s initial public offering, our Founders purchased an aggregate of 4,307,500 Founder Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.0058 per share (as compared to the $10.00 per share price being used to determine the number of shares of Common Stock being issued to the UpHealth and Cloudbreak equity holders in the Business Combinations or at which the PIPE Investors have agreed to purchase Common Stock), with the Sponsor purchasing 4,018,987 Founder Shares, Northland Investment purchasing 173,108 Founder Shares and the EarlyBird Group purchasing 115,405 Founder Shares. Additionally, the Founders purchased from GigCapital2 an aggregate of 567,500 Private Placement Units at a price of $10.00 per unit simultaneously with the consummation of GigCapital2\u2019s initial public offering for an aggregate purchase price of $5,675,000, with the Sponsor purchasing 481,250 Private Placement Units, Northland Investment purchasing 56,350 Private Placement Units and the EarlyBird Group purchasing 29,900 Private Placement Units. In addition, Northland concurrently purchased 120,000 Private Underwriter Shares at a price of $10.00 per share. Certain of GigCapital2\u2019s directors and executive officers, including Dr. Avi Katz, Dr. Raluca Dinu, Neil Miotto, John Mikulsky and Gil Frostig, also have a direct or indirect economic interest in the 481,250 Private Placement Units and in the 4,018,987 Founder Shares owned by the Sponsor. The 4,018,987 Founder Shares owned by the Sponsor would have had an aggregate market value of $40,230,060 based upon the closing price of $10.01 per public share on the NYSE on March 26, 2021, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this Annual Report. The 481,250 private placement units held by the Sponsor would have had an aggregate market value of $4,817,313 based upon the closing price of $10.01 per public unit on the NYSE on March 26, 2021, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this Annual Report. Additionally, the Sponsor, officers and directors do not currently have any unreimbursed out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the Business Combinations.\nOur Initial Stockholders, including our Sponsor and our independent directors, hold a significant number of shares of our Common Stock. They will lose their entire investment in us if a business combination is not completed.\nOur Initial Stockholders hold in the aggregate 4,995,000 Founder Shares, representing 23% of the total shares outstanding as of the date of this Annual Report. The Founder Shares will be worthless if we do not complete a business combination by the applicable deadline.\nThe Founder Shares are identical to the shares of Common Stock included in the public units, except that: (i) the Founder Shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions; (ii) our Initial Stockholders, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed: (a) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their shares of Common Stock in connection with the completion of our Business Combinations; (b) waive their redemption rights with respect to their shares of Common Stock in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our current amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of the IPO or to provide for redemption in connection with a business combination; and (c) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Initial Stockholder Shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by the applicable deadline (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination by the applicable deadline.\nThe personal and financial interests of our officers and directors may have influenced their motivation in identifying and selecting each of UpHealth and Cloudbreak, completing a business combination with each of UpHealth and Cloudbreak and may influence their operation of the post-combination company following the Business Combinations. This risk may become more acute as the deadline of the applicable deadline for completing an initial business combination nears.\nOur Sponsor, directors or officers or their affiliates may elect to purchase shares or warrants from public stockholders, which may influence a vote on a proposed Business Combinations and the other proposals described in this Annual Report and reduce the public \u201cfloat\u201d of our Common Stock.\nOur Sponsor, directors or officers or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our Business Combinations, although they are under no obligation to do so. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our Sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. The purpose of such purchases could be to vote such shares in favor of the Business Combinations and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the Business Combinations or to satisfy closing conditions in the Business Combination Agreements regarding required amounts of cash or cash equivalents that we have from any source equal or exceeds certain thresholds where it appears that such requirements would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. This may result in the completion of our Business Combinations that may not otherwise have been possible. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.\nIn addition, if such purchases are made, the public \u201cfloat\u201d of our Common Stock and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to obtain or maintain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on the NYSE or another national securities exchange or reducing the liquidity of the trading market for our Common Stock.\nStockholders of the post-combination company may not be able to enforce judgments entered by United States courts against certain of our officers and directors.\nWe are incorporated in the State of Delaware. However, following the Business Combinations, some of our directors and executive officers may reside outside of the U.S. As a result, stockholders of the post-combination company may not be able to effect service of process upon those persons within the U.S. or enforce against those persons judgments obtained in U.S. courts.\nA market for the Company\u2019s securities may not continue, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of its securities.\nFollowing the Business Combinations, the price of the post-combination company\u2019s securities may fluctuate significantly due to the market\u2019s reaction to the Business Combinations and general market and economic conditions. An active trading market for the Company\u2019s securities following the Business Combinations may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. In addition, the price of the post-combination company\u2019s securities after the Business Combinations can vary due to general economic conditions and forecasts, the post-combination company\u2019s general business condition and the release of the post-combination company\u2019s financial reports. Additionally, if the post-combination company\u2019s securities are not listed on, or become delisted from, the NYSE for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board (an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange) or the post-combination company\u2019s securities are not listed on the NYSE and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, the liquidity and price of the post-combination company\u2019s securities may be more limited than if the post-combination company\u2019s securities were quoted or listed on the NYSE or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established or sustained.\nThe ability to execute the post-combination company\u2019s strategic plan could be negatively impacted to the extent a significant number of stockholders choose to redeem their shares in connection with the Business Combinations.\nDepending upon the aggregate amount of cash consideration the Company would be required to pay for all shares of Common Stock that are validly submitted for redemption, the post-combination company may be required to increase the financial leverage the post-combination company\u2019s business would have to support. This may negatively impact its ability to execute on its own future strategic plan and its financial viability.\nIf the post-combination company fails to introduce or acquire new products or services that achieve broad market acceptance on a timely basis, or if its products or services are not adopted as expected, the combined company will not be able to compete effectively.\nThe post-combination company will operate in a highly competitive, quickly changing environment, and the combined company\u2019s future success depends on its ability to develop or acquire, and introduce new products and services that achieve broad market acceptance. The post-combination company\u2019s ability to successfully introduce and market new products is unproven. Because the post-combination company will have a limited operating history and the market for its products, including newly acquired or developed products, is rapidly evolving, it is difficult to predict the combined company\u2019s operating results, particularly with respect to any new products that it may introduce. The post-combination company\u2019s future success will depend in large part upon its ability to identify demand trends in the market in which it will operate and quickly develop or acquire, and design, manufacture and sell, products and services that satisfy these demands in a cost-effective manner.\nIn order to differentiate the post-combination company\u2019s products and services from competitors\u2019 products, the post-combination company will need to increase focus and capital investment in research and development, including software development. If any products currently sold by, and services offered by, either UpHealth or Cloudbreak do not continue, or if the post-combination company\u2019s new products or services fail to achieve widespread market acceptance, or if we are unsuccessful in capitalizing on opportunities in the market in which the post-combination company will operate, the post-combination company\u2019s future growth may be slowed and its business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Successfully predicting demand trends is difficult, and it is very difficult to predict the effect that introducing a new product or service will have on existing product or service sales. It is possible that the post-combination company may not be\nsuccessful with its new products and services, and as a result the post-combination company\u2019s future growth may be slowed and its business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Also, the post-combination company\u2019s may not be able to respond effectively to new product or service announcements by competitors by quickly introducing competitive products and services.\nIn addition, the post-combination company may acquire companies and technologies in the future. In these circumstances, the combined company may not be able to successfully manage integration of the new product and service lines with the combined company\u2019s existing suite of products and services. If the post-combination company is unable to effectively and successfully further develop these new product and service lines, the post-combination company may not be able to increase or maintain sales (as compared to sales of UpHealth or Cloudbreak, as applicable, on a standalone basis), and the post-combination company\u2019s gross margin (as compared to sales of UpHealth or Cloudbreak, as applicable, on a standalone basis) may be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, the success of the post-combination company\u2019s new products will depend on several factors, including, but not limited to, market demand costs, timely completion and introduction of these products, prompt resolution of any defects or bugs in these products, the post-combination company\u2019s ability to support these products, differentiation of new products from those of the post-combination company\u2019s competitors, market acceptance of these products, delays and quality issues in releasing new products and services. The occurrence of one or more of the foregoing factors may result in lower quarterly revenue than expected, and the post-combination company may in the future experience product or service introductions that fall short of its projected rates of market adoption.\nIf the post-combination company\u2019s products and services fail to achieve and sustain sufficient market acceptance, the combined company\u2019s revenue will be adversely affected.\nThe post-combination company\u2019s success will depend on its ability to develop and market products and services that are recognized and accepted as reliable, enabling and cost-effective. Some potential customers of the combined company may already use products or services similar to what UpHealth and Cloudbreak currently offers and similar to what the post-combination company may offer in the future and may be reluctant to replace those products or services with what UpHealth and Cloudbreak currently offers or which the combined company may offer in the future. Market acceptance of the post-combination company\u2019s products, services and technology will depend on many factors, including the post-combination company\u2019s ability to convince potential customers that the post-combination company\u2019s products, services and technology are an attractive alternative to existing products, services and technology. Prior to adopting the post-combination company\u2019s products, services and technology, some potential customers may need to devote time and effort to testing and validating the post-combination company\u2019s systems. Any failure of the post-combination company\u2019s systems to meet these customer benchmarks could result in potential customers choosing to retain their existing systems or to purchase systems other than the combined company\u2019s.\nIf the Business Combinations\u2019 benefits do not meet the expectations of investors, stockholders or financial analysts, the market price of the Company\u2019s securities may decline.\nIf the benefits of the Business Combinations do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of the Company\u2019s securities prior to the Closing may decline. The market values of the Company\u2019s securities at the time of the Business Combinations may vary significantly from their prices on the date the Business Combinations were executed, the date of this Annual Report, or the date on which the Company\u2019s stockholders vote on the Business Combinations.\nIn addition, following the Business Combinations, fluctuations in the price of the Company\u2019s securities could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. Prior to the Business Combinations, there has not been a public market for UpHealth\u2019s or Cloudbreak\u2019s stock and trading in the shares of Company Common Stock has not been active. Accordingly, the valuation ascribed to UpHealth, Cloudbreak and Company Common Stock in the Business Combinations may not be indicative of the price that will prevail in the trading market following the Business Combinations. If an active market for the Company\u2019s securities develops and continues, the trading price of the Company\u2019s securities following the Business Combinations could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on your investment in the Company\u2019s securities and the Company\u2019s securities\nmay trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of the Company\u2019s securities may not recover and may experience a further decline.\nFactors affecting the trading price of the Company\u2019s securities following the Business Combinations may include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in the post-combination company\u2019s quarterly financial results or the\nquarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to the post-combination company;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market\u2019s expectations about the post-combination company\u2019s operating results;\n\u2022\nsuccess of competitors;\n\u2022\nthe post-combination company\u2019s operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning the post-combination company or the market in general;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the post-combination company\u2019s;\n\u2022\nthe post-combination company\u2019s ability to market new and enhanced services and products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting the post-combination company\u2019s business;\n\u2022\ncommencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving the Company;\n\u2022\nchanges in the post-combination company\u2019s capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022\nthe volume of shares of the post-combination company\u2019s securities available for public sale;\n\u2022\nany major change in the board or management;\n\u2022\nsales of substantial amounts of Common Stock by the post-combination company\u2019s directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of the Company\u2019s securities irrespective of its operating performance. The stock market in general and the NYSE have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of the Company\u2019s securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to the Company could depress the Company\u2019s stock price regardless of the Company\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. A decline in the market price of the Company\u2019s securities also could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to issue additional securities and the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nFollowing the Business Combinations, if securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about the Company, its business, or its market, or if they change their recommendations regarding the Company\u2019s securities adversely, the price and trading volume of the Company\u2019s securities could decline.\nThe trading market for the post-combination company\u2019s securities will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about the post-combination company, its business, its market, or its competitors. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on the post-combination company. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of the post-combination company, the post-combination company\u2019s stock price and trading volume would likely be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts who may cover the post-combination company, change their recommendation regarding the post-combination company\u2019s stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about the post-combination company\u2019s competitors, the price of the post-combination company\u2019s securities would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover the post-combination company were to cease coverage of the post-combination company or fail to regularly publish reports on it, the post-combination company could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause its stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe future sales of shares by existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock in the public market could occur at anytime. If the Company\u2019s stockholders sell, or the market perceives that the Company\u2019s stockholders intend to sell, substantial amounts of the Company\u2019s Common Stock in the public market, the market price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock could decline.\nOur public stockholders will experience dilution as a consequence of, among other transactions, the issuance of Common Stock as consideration in the Business Combinations. Having a minority share position may reduce the influence that our current stockholders have on the management of the post-combination company.\nThe issuance of the Common Stock in the Business Combinations will dilute the equity interest of our existing stockholders and may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our public shares and/or public warrants.\nIt is anticipated that, upon completion of the Business Combinations, assuming no redemptions: (i) the Company\u2019s public stockholders will retain an ownership interest of approximately 12.35% in the post-combination company (not including shares beneficially owned by our Sponsor); (ii) the PIPE Investors will own approximately 2.36% of the post-combination company (such that public stockholders, including the PIPE Investors, will own approximately 14.72% of the post-combination company); (iii) our Initial Stockholders (including our Sponsor) will own approximately 3.6% of the post-combination company; (iv) the former UpHealth equity holders will own approximately 74.22% of the post-combination company, assuming $86,200,000 of cash is used to repurchase UpHealth shares and (v) the former Cloudbreak equity holders will own approximately 7.11% of the post-combination company, assuming no cash is used to repurchase Cloudbreak Units. The ownership percentage with respect to the post-combination company following the Business Combinations does not take into account (i) warrants to purchase Common Stock that will remain outstanding immediately following the Business Combinations (ii) conversion of the Convertible Notes into shares of Common Stock or (iii) the issuance of any shares upon completion of the Business Combinations under the Incentive Plan. Depending on the number of public shares redeemed, our current stockholders could own a majority of the voting rights in the post-combination company, but would not have effective control over the post-combination company.\nThe NYSE may not list our securities on its exchange, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nIn connection with the Business Combinations, in order to obtain the listing of the post-combination company\u2019s securities on the NYSE, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with the NYSE\u2019s initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than the NYSE\u2019s continued listing requirements. We will seek to have the post-combination company\u2019s securities listed on the NYSE upon consummation of the Business Combinations. We\ncannot assure you that we will be able to meet all initial listing requirements. Even if the post-combination company\u2019s securities are listed on the NYSE, we may be unable to maintain the listing of its securities in the future.\nIf we fail to meet the initial listing requirements and the NYSE does not list the post-combination company\u2019s securities on its exchange, neither UpHealth nor Cloudbreak would not be required to consummate the Business Combinations. In the event that either UpHealth or Cloudbreak elected to waive this condition, and the Business Combinations were consummated without the post-combination company\u2019s securities being listed on the NYSE or on another national securities exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u2022\nreduced liquidity for our securities;\n\u2022\na determination that our Common Stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our Common Stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u2022\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u2022\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \u201ccovered securities.\u201d If the post-combination company\u2019s securities were not listed on the NYSE, such securities would not qualify as covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities because states are not preempted from regulating the sale of securities that are not covered securities. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state, other than the State of Idaho, having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states.\nResales of the shares of Common Stock included in the stock consideration could depress the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe will have approximately 128,942,357 shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately following the Business Combinations, and there may be a large number of shares of Common Stock sold in the market following the completion of the Business Combinations or shortly thereafter. The shares held by the Company\u2019s public stockholders are freely tradable. In addition, the Company will be obligated to register the resale of shares of Common Stock issued as merger consideration, which shares will become available for resale following the expiration of any applicable lockup period. We also expect that Rule 144 will become available for the resale of shares of our Common Stock that are not registered for resale once one year has elapsed from the date that we file the Current Report on Form 8-K following the Closing that includes the required Form 10 information that reflects we are no longer a shell company. Such sales of shares of Common Stock or the perception of such sales may depress the market price of our Common Stock.\nThe post-combination company may redeem the unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to warrant holders, thereby making their warrants worthless.\nThe post-combination company has the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of the Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date the post-combination company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. If and when the warrants become redeemable by the post-combination company, the post-combination company may exercise its redemption right even if the post-combination company is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding\nwarrants could force you (i) to exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) to sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants. None of the Private Placement Warrants and warrants underlying the units issuable upon conversion of working capital loan will be redeemable by the post-combination company so long as they are held by their initial purchasers or their permitted transferees.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in the proposed Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nThe proposed Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation will contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. The post-combination company is also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for the post-combination company\u2019s securities. These provisions will include:\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of the Board;\n\u2022\nthe right of our Board to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our Board or the resignation, death or removal of a director in certain circumstances, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a meeting of stockholders may only be called by members of our Board or the stockholders holding a majority of our shares, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of New UpHealth or changes in the New UpHealth Board and New UpHealth\u2019s management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the DGCL, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding Common Stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of New UpHealth Common Stock. Any provision of Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Common Stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Common Stock.\nThe JOBS Act permits \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d like us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe currently qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, including: (i) the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements with respect to internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of SOX; (ii) the exemptions from say-on-pay, say-on-frequency and say-on-golden parachute voting requirements; and (iii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. As a result, our stockholders may\nnot have access to certain information they deem important. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year: (a) following October 18, 2023, the fifth anniversary of our IPO; (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion; or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700,000,000 as of the prior June 30th, and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we are an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected to avail ourselves of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our Common Stock less attractive because we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Common Stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Common Stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of SOX, which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. To comply with the requirements of being a public company, the post-combination company will be required to provide management\u2019s assessment on internal controls commencing with the annual report for fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, and we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing additional internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff. The standards required for a public company under Section 404 of SOX are significantly more stringent than those required of UpHealth and Cloudbreak as privately-held companies. Further, as an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the date we are no longer an emerging growth company. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event that it is not satisfied with the level at which the controls of the post-combination company are documented, designed or operating.\nTesting and maintaining these controls can divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. If we identify material weaknesses in the internal control over financial reporting of the post-combination company or are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting when we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our Common Stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nActivities taken by the Company\u2019s affiliates to purchase, directly or indirectly, public shares will increase the likelihood of approval of the UpHealth Business Combination Proposal, the Cloudbreak Business Combination Proposal and the other Proposals and may affect the market price of the Company\u2019s securities.\nThe Company\u2019s Founders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the consummation of the Business Combinations. None of the Company\u2019s Founders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates will make any such purchases when such parties are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or during a restricted period under Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Although none of the Company\u2019s Founders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates currently anticipate paying any premium purchase price for such public shares, in the event such parties do, the payment of a premium may not be in the best interest of those stockholders not receiving any such additional consideration. There is no limit on the number of shares that could be acquired by the Company\u2019s Founders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates, or the price such parties may pay.\nIf such transactions are effected, the consequence could be to cause the Business Combinations to be approved in circumstances where such approval could not otherwise be obtained. Purchases of shares by the persons described above would allow them to exert more influence over the approval of the UpHealth Business Combination Proposal, the Cloudbreak Business Combination Proposal and other proposals and would likely increase the chances that such Proposals would be approved. If the market does not view the Business Combinations positively, purchases of public shares may have the effect of counteracting the market\u2019s view, which would otherwise be reflected in a decline in the market price of the Company\u2019s securities. In addition, the termination of the support provided by these purchases may materially adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s securities.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, no agreements with respect to the private purchase of public shares by the Company or the persons described above have been entered into with any such investor or holder. The Company will file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC to disclose private arrangements entered into or significant private purchases made by any of the aforementioned persons that would affect the vote on the Business Combinations Proposal or other proposals.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, investments and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to laws, regulations and rules enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, the Company is required to comply with certain SEC, NYSE and other legal or regulatory requirements, including the NYSE upon the transfer of its listing. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws, regulations and rules may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws, regulations and rules and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nWe have not registered the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the public warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time, and such registration may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise public warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its public warrants except on a cashless basis and potentially causing such public warrants to expire worthless.\nWe have not registered the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the public warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time. However, under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days after the closing of our initial business combination, we will use our best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement for the registration under the Securities Act of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and thereafter will use our best efforts to cause the same to become effective within 60 business days following our initial business combination and to maintain a current prospectus relating to the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the public warrants, until the expiration of the public warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if, for example, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement or prospectus, the financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current or correct or the SEC issues a stop order. If the shares issuable\nupon exercise of the public warrants are not registered under the Securities Act, we will be required to permit holders to exercise their public warrants on a cashless basis. However, no public warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their public warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder or an exemption from registration is available. Notwithstanding the above, if our Common Stock is at the time of any exercise of a public warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a \u201ccovered security\u201d under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of public warrants who exercise their public warrants to do so on a \u201ccashless basis\u201d in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, and in the event we do not so elect, we will use our best efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any public warrant, or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the public warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the public warrants under applicable state securities laws and there is no exemption available. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the public warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holder of such public warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such public warrant and such public warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their public warrants as part of a purchase of public units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the shares of Common Stock included in the public units. If and when the public warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. We will use our best efforts to register or qualify such shares of Common Stock under the blue sky laws of the state of residence in those states in which the warrants were offered by us in the IPO. However, there may be instances in which holders of our public warrants may be unable to exercise such public warrants but holders of our private warrants may be able to exercise such private warrants.\nOur Board did not obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion in determining whether or not to proceed with the business combination.\nOur Board did not obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion in connection with their determination to approve the Business Combinations. In analyzing the Business Combinations, our Board and management conducted due diligence on each of UpHealth and Cloudbreak and researched the industry in which it operates and concluded that the Business Combinations were in the best interest of our stockholders. Accordingly, investors will be relying solely on the judgment of our Board in valuing each of UpHealth\u2019s business and Cloudbreak\u2019s business, and our Board may not have properly valued such business. The lack of a third-party valuation or fairness opinion may also lead an increased number of stockholders to vote against the proposed business combination or demand redemption of their shares for cash, which could potentially impact the ability to consummate the Business Combinations or the operations of the post-combination company.\nThe Company may be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the applicable rules of the NYSE and, as a result, may qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. If the Company relies on these exemptions, its stockholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nUpon the Closing, depending on the number of shares of Common Stock redeemed by the Company\u2019s public stockholders, the former UpHealth equityholders and former Cloudbreak equityholders may control a majority of the voting power of the post-combination company\u2019s outstanding Common Stock, and the Company may then be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of applicable rules of the NYSE upon the Closing of the Business Combinations. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements:\n\u2022\nthat a majority of the board consists of independent directors;\n\u2022\nfor an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees;\n\u2022\nthat the controlled company has a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022\nthat the controlled company has a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibility.\nIf available, the post-combination company may use these exemptions now or in the future. As a result, the post-combination company\u2019s stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.\nIf the conditions to the Business Combination Agreements are not met, the Business Combination may not occur.\nEven if the Business Combination Agreements are approved by the stockholders of GigCapital2, specified conditions must be satisfied or waived before the parties to the Business Combination Agreements are obligate to complete the Business Combinations. GigCapital2, UpHealth and Cloudbreak may not satisfy all of the closing conditions in the Business Combination Agreements. If the closing conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Business Combinations will not occur, or will be delayed pending later satisfaction or waiver, and such delay may cause GigCapital2, UpHealth and Cloudbreak to each lose some or all of the intended benefits of the Business Combinations.\nThe Company\u2019s proposed Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the sole and exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between the Company and its stockholders, which could limit the Company\u2019s stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers, or employees.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation will require, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against our directors, officers, and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder\u2019s counsel except any action (A) as to which the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction, or (D) any action arising under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as to which the Court of Chancery and the federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or employees which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. However, there is no assurance that a court would enforce the choice of forum provision contained in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. If a court were to find such provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation will provide that the exclusive forum provision will be applicable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nThe future exercise of registration rights may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nCertain of our stockholders will have registration rights for restricted securities. We are obligated to register certain securities, including all of the shares of Common Stock held by the Initial Stockholders, shares of Common Stock received by certain significant UpHealth stockholders as part of the UpHealth Business Combination, shares of Common Stock received by certain significant Cloudbreak members as part of the Cloudbreak Business Combination. We are obligated to (i) file a resale \u201cshelf\u201d registration statement to register such securities (and any shares of UpHealth Common Stock and any Cloudbreak Units into which they may be exercised following the consummation of the Business Combinations) within 15 business days after of the Closing Date and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after the filing. Sales of a substantial number of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the resale registration statement in the public market could occur at any time the registration statement remains effective. In addition, certain registration rights holders can request underwritten offerings to sell their securities. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our Common Stock.\nThere is uncertainty regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the redemption to the holders of our Common Stock.\nThere is some uncertainty regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of our Common Stock who exercise their redemption rights. The uncertainty of tax consequences relates primarily to the individual circumstances of the taxpayer and include (i) whether the redemption results in a dividend or a sale taxable as capital gain, and (ii) whether such capital gain is \u201clong-term\u201d or \u201cshort-term.\u201d Whether the redemption qualifies for sale treatment will depend largely on whether the holder owns (or is deemed to own) any shares of our Common Stock following the redemption, and if so, the total number of shares of our Common Stock held by the holder both before and after the redemption relative to all shares of our Common Stock outstanding both before and after the redemption. The redemption generally will be treated as a sale, rather than a dividend, if the redemption (i) is \u201csubstantially disproportionate\u201d with respect to the holder, (ii) results in a \u201ccomplete termination\u201d of the holder\u2019s interest in GigCapital2 or (iii) is \u201cnot essentially equivalent to a dividend\u201d with respect to the holder. Due to the personal and subjective nature of certain of such tests and the absence of clear guidance from the IRS, there is uncertainty as to whether a holder who elects to exercise its redemption rights will be treated as receiving a dividend or recognizing capital gain.", "PERMNO": 18802, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "GIX"}
