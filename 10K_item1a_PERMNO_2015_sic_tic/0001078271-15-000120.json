{"cik": "1078271", "company": "EXTREME NETWORKS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-09-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThe following is a list of risks and uncertainties which may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The risks and uncertainties set out below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face, and some are endemic to the networking industry.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future because a number of factors could negatively affect our financial results.\nWe have a limited history of profitability and have reported losses in some of our prior fiscal years. In addition, in years when we reported profits, we were not profitable in each quarter during those years. We anticipate continuing to incur significant sales and marketing, product development and general and administrative expenses. Any delay in generating or recognizing revenue could result in a loss for a quarter or full year. Even if we are profitable, our operating results may fall below our expectations and those of our investors, which could cause the price of our stock to fall.\nWe may experience challenges or delays in generating or recognizing revenue for a number of reasons and our revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nwe are dependent upon obtaining orders during a quarter and shipping those orders in the same quarter to achieve our revenue objectives;\n\u2022\ndecreases in the prices of the products that we sell;\n\u2022\nthe mix of products sold and the mix of distribution channels through which products are sold;\n\u2022\nacceptance provisions in customer contracts;\n\u2022\nour ability to deliver installation or inspection services by the end of the quarter;\n\u2022\nchanges in general and/or specific economic conditions in the networking industry;\n\u2022\nseasonal fluctuations in demand for our products and services;\n\u2022\na disproportionate percentage of our sales occurring in the last month of the quarter;\n\u2022\nour ability to ship products by the end of a quarter;\n\u2022\nreduced visibility into the implementation cycles for our products and our customers\u2019 spending plans;\n\u2022\nour ability to forecast demand for our products, which in the case of lower-than-expected sales, may result in excess or obsolete inventory in addition to non-cancelable purchase commitments for component parts;\n\u2022\nsales to the telecommunications service provider market, which represent a significant source of large product orders, are especially volatile and difficult to forecast;\n\u2022\nproduct returns or the cancellation or rescheduling of orders;\n\u2022\nannouncements and new product introductions by our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and support relationships with enterprise customers, service providers and other potential large customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve targeted cost reductions;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in warranty or other service expenses actually incurred;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole- or limited-source components for our products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nincreases in the price of the components that we purchase.\nDue to the foregoing factors, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Enterasys.\nThe success of the acquisition of Enterasys Networks Inc., which we acquired on October 31, 2013, will depend on, among other things, our ability to combine the businesses of Extreme and Enterasys in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing relationships and that allows us to achieve anticipated operational synergies. We have faced and will continue to face significant challenges in combining the two operations into one in a timely and efficient manner. The failure to integrate successfully and to manage successfully the challenges presented by the integration process may result in us not achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\nWe have made certain assumptions relating to the acquisition in our forecasts but the actual results could differ materially.\nWe have made certain assumptions relating to the forecast level of cost savings, synergies and associated costs of the acquisition of Enterasys. Our assumptions relating to the forecast level of cost savings, synergies and associated costs of the acquisition may be inaccurate based on the information available to us, including as the result of the failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition, higher than expected transaction and integration costs, including our ability to service new debt, as well as general economic and business conditions that may adversely affect the combined company following the completion of the acquisition.\nThe global economic environment has and may continue to negatively impact our business and operating results.\nThe challenges and uncertainty currently affecting global economic conditions may negatively impact our business and operating results in the following ways:\n\u2022\ncustomers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services;\n\u2022\ncustomers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, the amounts that they owe us which may adversely affect our cash flow, the timing of our revenue recognition and the amount of revenue;\n\u2022\nincreased pricing pressure may result from our competitors aggressively discounting their products;\n\u2022\naccurate budgeting and planning will be difficult due to low visibility into future sales;\n\u2022\nforecasting customer demand will be more difficult, increasing the risk of either excess and obsolete inventory if our forecast is too high or insufficient inventory to meet customer demand if our forecast is too low; and\n\u2022\nour component suppliers and contract manufacturers have been negatively affected by the economy which may result in product delays and changes in pricing and service levels.\nIf global economic conditions do not show continued improvement, we believe that we could experience material adverse impacts to our business and operating results.\nWe depend upon international sales for a significant portion of our revenue which imposes a number of risks on our business.\nInternational sales constitute a significant portion of our net revenue. Our ability to grow will depend in part on the expansion of international sales. Our international sales primarily depend on the success of our resellers and distributors. The failure of these resellers and distributors to sell our products internationally would limit our ability to sustain and grow our revenue. There are a number of risks arising from our international business, including:\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable collection cycles;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing operations across disparate geographic areas;\n\u2022\ndifficulties associated with enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nhigher credit risks requiring cash in advance or letters of credit;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in safeguarding intellectual property;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic turbulence;\n\u2022\nterrorism, war or other armed conflict;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters and epidemics;\n\u2022\npotential adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\ncompliance with regulatory requirements of foreign countries, including compliance with rapidly evolving environmental regulations;\n\u2022\ncompliance with U.S. laws and regulations pertaining to the sale and distribution of products to customers in foreign countries, including export controls and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and\n\u2022\nthe payment of operating expenses in local currencies, which exposes us to risks of currency fluctuations.\nSubstantially all of our international sales are U.S. Dollar-denominated. Future increases in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets. In the future, we may elect to invoice some of our international customers in local currency, which would expose us to fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and the particular local currency. If we do so, we may decide to engage in hedging transactions to minimize the risk of such fluctuations.\nWe have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the impact of payment of operating expenses in local currencies to some of our operating foreign subsidiaries. However, if we are not successful in managing these foreign currency transactions, we could incur losses from these activities.\nThe combination of our business with the Enterasys' business will continue to require significant management attention, and we expect to incur additional costs due to integration.\nThe combined company requires us to devote significant management attention and other resources to integrating the two businesses. We may not successfully complete the integration of our operations in a timely manner and may experience disruptions in relationships with customers, suppliers and employees as a result.\nThrough June 30, 2015, we have incurred transaction and integration costs in connection with the Enterasys acquisition of $35.9 million. We expect to incur additional costs integrating the companies\u2019 operations, product offerings, and personnel, which cannot be estimated accurately at this time. Although we expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the business will offset incremental transaction, integration and restructuring costs over time, we cannot give any assurance that this net benefit will be achieved. If the total costs of the integration exceed the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe expect the average selling prices of our products to decrease, which is likely to reduce gross margin and/or revenue.\nThe network equipment industry has traditionally experienced an erosion of average selling prices due to a number of factors, including competitive pricing pressures, promotional pricing and technological progress. We anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures, excess inventories, increased sales discounts and new product introductions by us or our competitors. We may experience decreases in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices. To maintain our gross margin, we must develop and introduce on a timely basis new products and product enhancements and continually reduce our product costs. Our failure to do so would likely cause our revenue and gross margin to decline.\nWe may engage in future acquisitions that dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities.\nAs part of our business strategy, we review acquisition and strategic investment prospects that we believe would complement our current product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. In the event of any future acquisitions, we could:\n\u2022\nissue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders' percentage ownership;\n\u2022\nincur substantial debt;\n\u2022\nassume contingent liabilities; or\n\u2022\nexpend significant cash.\nThese actions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or the price of our common stock. Moreover, even if we do obtain benefits in the form of increased sales and earnings, these benefits may be recognized much later than the time when the expenses associated with an acquisition are incurred. This is particularly relevant in cases where it would be necessary to integrate new types of technology into our existing portfolio and new types of products may be targeted for potential customers with which we do not have pre-existing relationships. Acquisitions and investment activities also entail numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations, technologies and/or products;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs associated with the acquisition or investment transaction;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations; and\n\u2022\nsubstantial charges for the amortization of certain purchased intangible assets, deferred stock compensation or similar items.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses, products, technologies, or personnel that we might acquire in the future, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur credit facilities impose financial and operating restrictions on us.\nOur debt instruments impose, and the terms of any future debt may impose, operating and other restrictions on us. These restrictions could affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, among other items, our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nguarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\ndeclare or pay dividends or other distributions to stockholders;\n\u2022\nrepurchase equity interests;\n\u2022\nchange the nature of our business;\n\u2022\nenter into swap agreements;\n\u2022\nissue or sell capital stock of certain of our subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.\nThe agreements governing our credit facilities also require us to achieve and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios.\nA breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments. If any such default occurs, the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. If we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt. If the debt under our credit agreement were to be accelerated, we cannot give assurance that this collateral would be sufficient to repay our debt.\nIf we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under our credit agreement, the lenders under such credit agreement could foreclose on, and acquire control of, substantially all of our assets.\nOur credit agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries. Borrowings under our credit facilities are secured by liens on substantially all our assets, including the capital stock of certain of our subsidiaries, and the assets of our subsidiaries that are loan party guarantors. If we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against this pledged capital stock and take control of substantially all of our assets.\nWe purchase several key components for products from single or limited sources and could lose sales if these suppliers fail to meet our needs.\nWe currently purchase several key components used in the manufacture of our products from single or limited sources and are dependent upon supply from these sources to meet our needs. Certain components such as tantalum capacitors, SRAM, DRAM, and printed circuit boards, have been in the past, and may in the future be, in short supply. We have encountered, and are likely in the future to encounter, shortages and delays in obtaining these or other components, and this could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer orders. Our principal sole-source components include:\n\u2022\nASICs;\n\u2022\nMerchant silicon;\n\u2022\nmicroprocessors;\n\u2022\nprogrammable integrated circuits;\n\u2022\nselected other integrated circuits;\n\u2022\ncustom power supplies; and\n\u2022\ncustom-tooled sheet metal.\nOur principal limited-source components include:\n\u2022\nflash memory;\n\u2022\nDRAMs and SRAMs;\n\u2022\nprinted circuit boards; and\n\u2022\nCAMs\n\u2022\nConnectors\n\u2022\nTiming circuits (crystals & clocks).\nWe use our forecast of expected demand to determine our material requirements. Lead times for materials and components we order vary significantly, and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms and demand for a component at a given time. If forecasts exceed orders, we may have excess and/or obsolete inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. If orders exceed forecasts, we may have inadequate supplies of certain materials and components, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer delivery requirements and to recognize revenue.\nGenerally, we do not have agreements fixing long-term prices or minimum volume requirements from suppliers. From time to time we have experienced shortages and allocations of certain components, resulting in delays in filling orders. Qualifying new suppliers to compensate for such shortages may be time-consuming and costly, and may increase the likelihood of errors in design or production. In addition, during the development of our products, we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our chipsets, which in turn has led to delays in product introductions. Similar delays may occur in the future. Furthermore, the performance of the components as incorporated in our products may not meet the quality requirements of our customers.\nIntense competition in the market for networking equipment could prevent us from increasing revenue and attaining profitability.\nThe market for network switching solutions is intensely competitive and dominated primarily by Brocade Communications Systems, Inc., Cisco Systems Inc., Dell, Hewlett-Packard Company, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., and Juniper Networks, Inc. Most of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, broader product lines and substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources. As a result, these competitors are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products. In addition, they have larger distribution channels, stronger brand names, access to more customers, a larger installed customer base and a greater ability to make attractive offers to channel partners and customers than we do. Some of our customers may question whether we have the financial resources to complete their projects and future service commitments.\nFor example, we have encountered, and expect to continue to encounter, many potential customers who are confident in and committed to the product offerings of our principal competitors. Accordingly, these potential customers may not consider or evaluate our products. When such potential customers have considered or evaluated our products, we have in the past lost, and expect in the future to lose, sales to some of these customers as large competitors have offered significant price discounts to secure these sales.\nThe pricing policies of our competitors impact the overall demand for our products and services. Some of our competitors are capable of operating at significant losses for extended periods of time, increasing pricing pressure on our products and services. If we do not maintain competitive pricing, the demand for our products and services, as well as our market share, may decline. From time to time, we may lower the prices of our products and services in response to competitive pressure. When this happens, if we are unable to reduce our component costs or improve operating efficiencies, our revenue and gross margins will be adversely affected.\nWe may not fully realize the anticipated positive impacts to future financial results from our restructuring efforts.\nWe have undertaken restructuring efforts in the past to streamline operations and reduce operating expenses. Our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from our restructuring efforts within expected time frames is subject to many estimates and assumptions, and may vary materially based on factors such as market conditions and the effect of our restructuring efforts on our work force. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will fully realize the anticipated positive impacts to future financial results from our current or future restructuring efforts. If our estimates and assumptions are incorrect or if other unforeseen events occur, we may not achieve the cost savings expected from such restructurings, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIndustry consolidation may lead to stronger competition and may harm our operating results.\nThere has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. For example, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them with the ability to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Furthermore, particularly in the service provider market, rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers, with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants.\nWe intend to invest in engineering, sales, service, marketing and manufacturing on a long term basis, and delays or inability to attain the expected benefits may result in unfavorable operating results.\nWhile we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses, over the long term, we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering, sales, service, marketing and manufacturing functions as we focus on our foundational priorities, such as leadership in our core products and solutions and architectures for business transformation. We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to continually introduce new products and features that achieve broad market acceptance.\nThe network equipment market is characterized by rapid technological progress, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards. If we do not regularly introduce new products in this dynamic environment, our product lines will become obsolete. These new products must be compatible and inter-operate with products and architectures offered by other vendors. We have and may in the future experience delays in product development and releases, and such delays have and could in the future adversely affect our ability to compete and our operating results.\nWhen we announce new products or product enhancements or end of sale existing products that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing products, customers may defer or cancel orders for our existing products. These actions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results by unexpectedly decreasing sales, increasing inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence.\nEven if we introduce new switching products, alternative technologies could achieve widespread market acceptance and displace the Ethernet technology on which we have based our product architecture. For example, developments in routers and routing software could significantly reduce demand for our products. As a result, we may not be able to achieve widespread market acceptance of our current or future products.\nIf we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts, market needs and opportunities, and develop products and product enhancements that meet those technological shifts, needs and opportunities, or if those products are not made available in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance, we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future technological shifts, market needs and opportunities or be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet such technological shifts, needs or opportunities in a timely manner or at all. For example, the move from traditional network infrastructures towards SDN has been receiving considerable attention. In our view, it will take several years to see the full impact of SDN, and we believe the successful products and solutions in this market will combine hardware and software elements together. If we fail to anticipate market requirements or fail to develop and introduce new products or product enhancements to meet those needs in a timely manner, it could cause us to lose customers, and such failure could substantially decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products, which would significantly harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Even if we are able to anticipate, develop, and commercially introduce new products and enhancements, there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance.\nClaims of infringement by others may increase and the resolution of such claims may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patents, copyrights (including rights to \u201copen source\u201d software), and other intellectual property rights. Because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field, the secrecy of some pending patents and the issuance of new patents at a rapid pace, it is not possible to determine in advance if a product or component might infringe the patent rights of others. Because of the potential for courts awarding substantial damages, the lack of predictability of such awards, and the high legal costs associated with the defense of such patent infringement matters that would be expended to prove lack of infringement, it is not uncommon for companies in our industry to settle even potentially unmeritorious claims for very substantial amounts. Further, the entities with whom we have or could have disputes or discussions include entities with extensive patent portfolios and substantial financial assets. These entities are actively engaged in programs to generate substantial revenue from their patent portfolios and are seeking or may seek significant payments or royalties from us and others in our industry.\nLitigation resulting from claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others has resulted and could in the future result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have received notices from entities alleging that we may be infringing their patents, and we are currently parties to patent litigation as described under Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings. Without regard to the merits of these or any other claims, an adverse court order or a settlement could require us, among other actions, to:\n\u2022\nstop selling our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\nobtain a royalty bearing license to sell or use the relevant technology, and that license may not be available on reasonable terms or available at all;\n\u2022\npay damages; or\n\u2022\nredesign those products that use the disputed technology.\nIn addition, our products include so-called \u201copen source\u201d software. Open source software is typically licensed for use at no initial charge, but imposes on the user of the open source software certain requirements to license to others both the open source software as well as modifications to the open source software under certain circumstances. Our use of open source software subjects us to certain additional risks for the following reasons:\n\u2022\nopen source license terms may be ambiguous and may result in unanticipated obligations regarding the licensing of our products and intellectual property;\n\u2022\nopen source software cannot be protected under trade secret law;\n\u2022\nsuppliers of open-source software do not provide the warranty, support and liability protections typically provided by vendors who offer proprietary software; and\n\u2022\nit may be difficult for us to accurately determine the developers of the open source code and whether the acquired software infringes third-party intellectual property rights.\nWe believe that even if we do not infringe the rights of others, we will incur significant expenses in the future due to defense of legal claims, disputes or licensing negotiations, though the amounts cannot be determined. These expenses may be material or otherwise adversely affect our operating results.\nOur operating results may be negatively affected by defending or pursuing claims or lawsuits.\nWe have and may in the future pursue or be subject to claims or lawsuits in the normal course of our business. In addition to the intellectual property lawsuits described above, we are currently parties to other litigation as described in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Regardless of the result, litigation can be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution of a lawsuit in which we are a defendant could result in a court order against us or payments to other parties that would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Even if we are successful in prosecuting claims and lawsuits, we may not recover damages sufficient to cover our expenses incurred to manage, investigate and pursue the litigation. In addition, subject to certain limitations, we may be obligated to indemnify our current and former directors, officers and employees in certain lawsuits. We do not maintain adequate insurance coverage to cover all of our litigation costs and liabilities.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property, our business could suffer.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. However, we cannot ensure that the actions we have taken will adequately protect our intellectual property rights or that other parties will not independently develop similar or competing products that do not infringe on our patents. We generally enter into confidentiality, invention assignment or license agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties with whom we do business, and control access to and distribution of our intellectual property and other proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise misappropriate or use our products or technology, which would adversely affect our business.\nWhen our products contain undetected errors, we may incur significant unexpected expenses and could lose sales.\nNetwork products frequently contain undetected errors when new products or new versions or updates of existing products are released to the marketplace. In the past, we have experienced such errors in connection with new products and product updates. We have experienced component problems in prior years that caused us to incur higher than expected warranty, service costs and expenses, and other related operating expenses. In the future, we expect that, from time to time, such errors or component failures will be found in new or existing products after the commencement of commercial shipments. These problems may have a material adverse effect on our business by causing us to incur significant warranty, repair and replacement costs, diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from new product development efforts, delaying the recognition of revenue and causing significant customer relations problems. Further, if products are not accepted by customers due to such defects, and such returns exceed the amount we accrued for defective returns based on our historical experience, our operating results would be adversely affected.\nOur products must successfully inter-operate with products from other vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a network, it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems. The occurrence of system errors, whether or not caused by our products, could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses. The occurrence of any such problems would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur dependence on a few manufacturers for our manufacturing requirements could harm our operating results.\nWe primarily rely on our manufacturing partners; Alpha Networks, Inc. headquartered in Hsinchu, Taiwan, Flextronics, Inc. headquartered in Singapore, and select other partners to manufacture our products. We have experienced delays in product shipments from our manufacturing partners in the past, which in turn delayed product shipments to our customers. These or similar problems may arise in the future, such as delivery of products of inferior quality, delivery of insufficient quantity of products, or the interruption or discontinuance of operations of a manufacturer, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. In addition, any natural disaster or business interruption to our manufacturing partners could significantly disrupt our business. While we maintain strong relationships with our manufacturing partners, our agreements with these manufacturers are generally of limited duration and pricing, quality and volume commitments are negotiated on a recurring basis. The failure to maintain continuing agreements with our manufacturing partners could adversely affect our business. We intend to introduce new products and product enhancements, which will require that we rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating our efforts with those of our suppliers and contract manufacturers.\nAs part of our cost-reduction efforts, we will need to realize lower per unit product costs from our manufacturing partners by means of volume efficiencies and the utilization of manufacturing sites in lower-cost geographies. However, we cannot be certain when or if such price reductions will occur. The failure to obtain such price reductions would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe must continue to develop and increase the productivity of our indirect distribution channels to increase net revenue and improve our operating results.\nOur distribution strategy focuses primarily on developing and increasing the productivity of our indirect distribution channels. If we fail to develop and cultivate relationships with significant channel partners, or if these channel partners are not successful in their sales efforts, sales of our products may decrease and our operating results could suffer. Many of our channel partners also sell products from other vendors that compete with our products. Our channel partners may not continue to market or sell our products effectively or to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales, marketing and technical support. We may not be able to successfully manage our sales channels or enter into additional reseller and/or distribution agreements. Our failure to do any of these could limit our ability to grow or sustain revenue.\nOur operating results for any given period have and will continue to depend to a significant extent on large orders from a relatively small number of channel partners and other customers. However, we do not have binding purchase commitments from any of them. A substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to a significant reseller, distributor or other customer could harm our business, operating results and financial condition because our expense levels are based on our expectations as to future revenue and to a large extent are fixed in the short term. Under specified conditions, some third-party distributors are allowed to return products to us and unexpected returns could adversely affect our results.\nThe sales cycle for our products is long and we may incur substantial non-recoverable expenses or devote significant resources to sales that do not occur when anticipated.\nOur products represent a significant strategic decision by a customer regarding its communications infrastructure. The decision by customers to purchase our products is often based on the results of a variety of internal procedures associated with the evaluation, testing, implementation and acceptance of new technologies. Accordingly, the product evaluation process frequently results in a lengthy sales cycle, typically ranging from three months to longer than a year, and as a result, our ability to sell products is subject to a number of significant risks, including risks that:\n\u2022\nbudgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews by customers will result in the loss of potential sales;\n\u2022\nthere may be substantial variation in the length of the sales cycle from customer to customer, making decisions on the expenditure of resources difficult to assess;\n\u2022\nwe may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management time in an attempt to initiate or increase the sale of products to customers, but not succeed;\n\u2022\nif a sales forecast from a specific customer for a particular quarter is not achieved in that quarter, we may be unable to compensate for the shortfall, which could harm our operating results; and\n\u2022\ndownward pricing pressures could occur during the lengthy sales cycle for our products.\nOur revenues may decline as a result of changes in public funding of educational institutions.\nA portion of our revenues comes from sales to both public and private K-12 educational institutions. Public schools receive funding from local tax revenue, and from state and federal governments through a variety of programs, many of which seek to assist schools located in underprivileged or rural areas. The funding for a portion of our sales to educational institutions comes from a federal funding program known as the E-Rate program. E-Rate is a program of the Federal Communications Commission that subsidizes the purchase of approved telecommunications, Internet access, and internal connection costs for eligible public educational institutions. The E-Rate program, its eligibility criteria, the timing and specific amount of federal funding actually available and which Wi-Fi infrastructure and product sectors will benefit, are uncertain and subject to final federal program approval\nand funding appropriation continues to be under review by the Federal Communications Commission and there can be no assurance that this program or its equivalent will continue, and as a result, our business may be harmed. Furthermore, if state or local funding of public education is significantly reduced because of legislative or policy changes or by reductions in tax revenues due to changing economic conditions, our sales to educational institutions may be negatively impacted by these changed conditions. Any reduction in spending on information technology systems by educational institutions would likely materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. This is a specific example of the many factors which add additional uncertainty to our future revenue from our education end-customers.\nTo successfully manage our business or achieve our goals, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and promote key employees, and failure to do so can harm us.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management, engineering, sales and marketing, service and operations personnel, many of whom would be difficult to replace. We do not have employment contracts with these individuals that mandate that they render services for any specific term, nor do we carry life insurance on any of our key personnel. We have experienced and may in the future experience significant turnover in our executive personnel. In addition, retention has generally become more difficult for us, in part because the exercise price of most of the stock options granted to many of our employees is above the market price. As a result, we experienced high levels of attrition. We believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, engineering, sales and marketing, service, finance and operations personnel. The market for these personnel is competitive, and we have had difficulty in hiring employees, particularly engineers, in the time-frame we desire.\nCompanies in the networking industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices. We have from time to time been involved in claims like this with other companies and, although to date they have not resulted in material litigation, we do not know whether we will be involved in additional claims in the future. We could incur substantial costs in litigating any such claims, regardless of the merits.\nFailure to successfully expand our sales and support teams or educate them in regard to technologies and our product families may harm our operating results.\nThe sale of our products and services requires a concerted effort that is frequently targeted at several levels within a prospective customer's organization. We may not be able to increase net revenue unless we expand our sales and support teams in order to address all of the customer requirements necessary to sell our products.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate employees into our company or to educate and train current and future employees in regard to rapidly evolving technologies and our product families. A failure to do so may hurt our revenue growth and operating results.\nFailure of our products to comply with evolving industry standards and complex government regulations may adversely impact our business.\nIf we do not comply with existing or evolving industry standards and government regulations, we may not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply. The network equipment industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid changes in technology and customers' requirements and evolving industry standards. As a result, our success depends on:\n\u2022\nthe timely adoption and market acceptance of industry standards, and timely resolution of conflicting U.S. and international industry standards; and\n\u2022\nour ability to influence the development of emerging industry standards and to introduce new and enhanced products that are compatible with such standards.\nIn the past, we have introduced new products that were not compatible with certain technological standards, and in the future, we may not be able to effectively address the compatibility and interoperability issues that arise as a result of technological changes and evolving industry standards.\nOur products must also comply with various U.S. federal government regulations and standards defined by agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission, standards established by governmental authorities in various foreign countries and recommendations of the International Telecommunication Union. In some circumstances, we must obtain regulatory approvals or certificates of compliance before we can offer or distribute our products in certain jurisdictions or to certain customers. Complying with new regulations or obtaining certifications can be costly and disruptive to our business.\nIf we do not comply with existing or evolving industry standards or government regulations, we will not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply, which may prevent us from sustaining our net revenue or achieving profitability.\nIf we do not adequately manage and evolve our financial reporting and managerial systems and processes, our ability to manage and grow our business may be harmed.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with regulations requires an effective planning and management process. We need to continue improving our existing, and implement new, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. We need to ensure that the businesses acquired are appropriately integrated in our financial systems. We integrated the financial and other key managerial systems of Enterasys with Extreme effective July 1, 2014, the first day of our fiscal 2015. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the integration of acquired businesses, or delay and disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, could harm our ability to record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis, or to forecast future results.\nChanges in the effective tax rate including from the release of the valuation allowance recorded against our net U.S. deferred tax assets, or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns or change in ownership, could adversely affect our results.\nOur future effective tax rates may be volatile or adversely affected by changes in our business or U.S. or foreign tax laws, including: the partial or full release of the valuation allowance recorded against our net U.S. deferred tax assets; expiration of or lapses in the research and development tax credit laws; transfer pricing adjustments; tax effects of stock-based compensation; or costs related to restructuring. In addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. Although we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, there is no assurance that such determinations by us are in fact adequate. Changes in our effective tax rates or amounts assessed upon examination of our tax returns may have a material, adverse impact on our cash flows and our financial condition.\nOur future effective tax rate in particular could be adversely affected by a change in ownership pursuant to U.S. Internal Revenue Code Section 382. If a change in ownership occurs, it may limit our ability to utilize our net operating losses to offset our U.S. taxable income. If U.S. taxable income is greater than the change in ownership limitation, we will pay a higher rate of tax with respect to the amount of taxable income that exceeds the limitation. This could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. On April 26, 2012, we adopted an Amended and Restated Rights Agreement to help protect our assets (the \u201cRights Agreement\u201d). In general, this does not allow a stockholder to acquire more than 4.95% of our outstanding common stock without a waiver from our board of directors, who must take into account the relevant tax analysis relating to potential limitation of our net operating losses. The Rights Agreement is effective through May 31, 2016, subject to ratification by a majority of stockholders at our next annual stockholder meeting expected to be held on November 12, 2015.\nCompliance with laws, rules and regulations relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.\nFederal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as NASDAQ Stock Market rules and regulations, require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures, impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements, set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their Chief Executive Officers, Chief Financial Officers and directors for securities law violations. These laws, rules and regulations and the interpretation of these requirements are evolving, and we are making investments to evaluate current practices and to continue to achieve compliance, which investments may have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nOur headquarters and some significant supporting businesses are located in Northern California and other areas subject to natural disasters that could disrupt our operations and harm our business.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Silicon Valley in Northern California. Historically, this region as well as our R&D centers in North Carolina and New Hampshire have been vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, fires, floods and tropical storms, which at times have disrupted the local economy and posed physical risks to our property. We have contract manufacturers located in Taiwan where similar natural disasters and other risks may disrupt the local economy and pose physical risks to our property and the property of our contract manufacturer.\nIn addition, the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause further disruptions to the economies of the U.S. and other countries. If such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders for our products, our business and operating results will suffer.\nWe currently do not have redundant, multiple site capacity in the event of a natural disaster, terrorist act or other catastrophic event. In the event of such an occurrence, our business would suffer.\nOur stock price has been volatile in the past and our stock price may significantly fluctuate in the future.\nIn the past, our common stock price has fluctuated significantly. This could continue as we or our competitors announce new products, our results or those of our customers or competition fluctuate, conditions in the networking or semiconductor industry change, or when investors, change their sentiment toward stocks in the networking technology sector.\nIn addition, fluctuations in our stock price and our price-to-earnings multiple may make our stock attractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stock rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction, particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law and our adoption of a stockholder rights plan may delay or prevent an acquisition of Extreme, which could decrease the value of our Common Stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors. Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. In addition, our Board of Directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer. Although we believe these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law will provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some of our stockholders.\nOur Rights Agreement provides that if a single stockholder (or group) acquires more than 4.95% of our outstanding common stock without a waiver from our Board of Directors, each holder of one share of our common stock (other than the stockholder or group who acquired in excess of 4.95% of our common stock) may purchase a fractional share of our preferred stock that would result in substantial dilution to the triggering stockholder or group. Accordingly, although this plan is designed to prevent any limitation on the utilization of our net operating losses by avoiding issues raised under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the Rights Agreement could also serve as a deterrent to stockholders wishing to effect a change of control.\nWe rely on the availability of third-party licenses\nSome of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property, including open source software, licensed from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products. There can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products. Further, the failure to comply with the terms of any license, including free open source software, may result in our inability to continue to use such license. Our inability to maintain or re-license any third-party licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain third-party licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements, could require us, if possible, to develop substitute technology or obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost, any of which could delay or prevent product shipment and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches, and cyber-attacks could compromise our proprietary information, disrupt our internal operations and harm public perception of our products, which could adversely affect our business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners on our networks. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Increasingly, companies, including Extreme Networks, are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks on an ongoing basis. Despite our security measures, Extreme Networks' information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to penetration or attacks by computer programmers and hackers, or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks, creating system disruptions or slowdowns and exploiting security vulnerabilities of our products, and the information stored on our networks could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen, which could subject us to liability to our customers, suppliers, business partners and others, and cause us reputational and financial harm. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \"bugs\" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our networks.\nIf an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our network or in the network of a customer of our networking products, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products, the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed. In addition, the economic costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software systems and security vulnerabilities could be significant and may be difficult to anticipate or measure. Because the techniques used by computer programmers and hackers, many of whom are highly sophisticated and well-funded, to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until after they are used, we may be unable to\nanticipate or immediately detect these techniques. This could impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions, which could adversely affect our business.\nMarket conditions and changes in the industry could lead to discontinuation of our products or businesses resulting in asset impairments\nIn response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses. Any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges, such as inventory and technology-related write-offs, workforce reduction costs, charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities, or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products. Our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including purchased intangible assets, could change as a result of such assessments and decisions. Although in certain instances, our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed, our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers. Further, our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions.\nIf our products do not effectively inter-operate with our customers\u2019 networks and result in cancellations and delays of installations our business could be harmed.\nOur products are designed to interface with our customers\u2019 existing networks, each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors. Many of our customers\u2019 networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved. Our products must inter-operate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers\u2019 requirements. If we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers\u2019 networks, we may need to modify our software networking solutions to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will inter-operate and scale with the existing software and hardware, which could be costly and could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, if our products do not inter-operate with those of our customers\u2019 networks, demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be canceled. This could hurt our operating results, damage our reputation, and seriously harm our business and prospects.", "PERMNO": 86822, "SIC": 3576, "TIC": "EXTR"}
