{"cik": "1360214", "company": "Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.\nWe have incurred losses in every year of our operations, and we may never become profitable.\nWe have incurred losses in every year of our operations, including net losses of $(10,118,103) and $(7,643,124) for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, our accumulated deficit was $(41,865,495). On June 26, 2011, we suspended our operations and filed the Chapter 11 Case in the Bankruptcy Court. On December 8, 2011, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order dismissing the Chapter 11 Case following our entry into a line of credit agreement and securities purchase agreement with DermaStar International, LLC. Since the dismissal of the Chapter 11 Case, we have focused on resuming our operations and developing and implementing our business plan. We expect to incur increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to incur costs for commercialization activities and research and development. Although we have been generating revenue from our pharmacy operations following the closing of our acquisitions of Pharmacy Creations on April 1, 2014 and Park on January 1, 2015, our ability to generate significant revenues and achieve profitability will depend on a number of factors, including our ability, alone or with others, to identify promising development opportunities and select appropriate commercialization strategies, develop and commercialize our proprietary compounded formulations, interest physicians and health care organizations in our proprietary formulations, successfully market and sell these formulations, integrate and operate Pharmacy Creations, Park and any other pharmacies or outsourcing facilities we may build or acquire in the future, establish a network of pharmacies with a broad geographic footprint, and comply with federal and state laws related to pharmaceutical compounding and, if applicable, FDA regulations for any formulations for which we pursue FDA approval, as well as the other risk factors described in this Item 1A, many of which are outside of our direct control. Our ultimate success will depend on many factors, including factors outside of our control. These activities are costly and susceptible to failure, and we may never be able to achieve or sustain market acceptance of any of our proprietary formulations or generate sufficient revenue to support our business from our pharmacy operations, or reach the level of sales and revenues necessary to achieve and sustain profitability.\nWe aim to sell certain of our proprietary formulations primarily through a network of compounding pharmacies, but we may not be successful in our efforts to establish such a network or integrate these businesses into our operations.\nA key aspect of our business strategy is to establish a compounding pharmacy network, whether through acquisitions, establishing new pharmacies or entering into licensing arrangements with third-party pharmacies, through which we can market and sell our proprietary formulations and other non-proprietary products in all 50 states. On April 1, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Pharmacy Creations, a New Jersey-based compounding pharmacy, and on January 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Park, a California-based compounding pharmacy, through which we have rights to dispense formulations in 40 states. Additionally, in February 2015, we entered into a lease agreement for space in New Jersey and began construction efforts to build an outsourcing facility, which we expect to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2015. We have limited experience acquiring, building or operating compounding pharmacies or other prescription dispensing facilities or commercializing our formulations through ownership of or licensing arrangements with these pharmacies. We expect to expand our operations and personnel in the pharmacy operations area in order to further develop this compounding pharmacy network, but we may experience difficulties implementing this strategy, including difficulties that arise as a result of our lack of experience, and we may be unsuccessful. For instance, we may not be successful in our efforts to integrate, manage or otherwise realize the benefits we expect from our acquisitions of Pharmacy Creations, Park or any additional pharmacy businesses or outsourcing facilities we seek to acquire or build in the future, we may not be able to satisfy applicable federal and state licensing and other requirements for any such pharmacy businesses in a timely manner or at all, changes to state and federal pharmacy regulations may restrict compounding operations or make them more costly, we may be unable to achieve a sufficient physician and patient customer base to sustain our pharmacy operations, and we may not be able to enter into licensing or other arrangements with third-party pharmacies or outsourcing facilities when desired, on acceptable terms, or at all. Moreover, all such efforts to expand out pharmacy operations and establish a pharmacy network will involve significant costs and other resources, which we may not be able to afford, disrupt our other operations and distract management and our other employees from other aspects of our operations. Our business could materially suffer if we are unable to further develop this pharmacy network and, even if we are successful, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to recover our costs.\nWe are dependent on market acceptance of compounding pharmacies and compounded formulations, and physicians may be unwilling to prescribe, and patients may be unwilling to use, our proprietary customizable compounded formulations.\nWe currently expect to distribute our proprietary formulations through compounding pharmacies. Formulations prepared and dispensed by compounding pharmacies contain FDA-approved ingredients, but are not themselves approved by the FDA. As a result, our formulations have not undergone the FDA approval process and only limited data, if any, may be available with respect to the safety and efficacy of our formulations for any particular indication. In addition, certain compounding pharmacies have been the subject of widespread negative media coverage in recent years, and the actions of these pharmacies have resulted in increased scrutiny of compounding pharmacy activities from the FDA and state governmental agencies. As a result, some physicians may be hesitant to prescribe, and some patients may be hesitant to purchase and use, these non-FDA approved compounded formulations, particularly when an FDA-approved alternative is available. Other reasons physicians may be unwilling to prescribe or patients may be unwilling to use our proprietary customizable compounded formulations could include the following, among others: we are limited in our ability to discuss the efficacy or safety of our formulations with potential purchasers of our formulations to the extent applicable data is available; our pharmacy operations are primarily operating on a cash-pay basis and reimbursement may or may not be available from third-party payors, including the government Medicare and Medicaid programs; and our formulations are not presently being prepared in a manufacturing facility governed by cGMP requirements. Any failure by physicians, patients and/or third-party payors to accept and embrace compounded formulations could substantially limit our market and cause our operations to suffer.\nWe may not receive sufficient revenue through Pharmacy Creations and Park or other compounding pharmacies we may acquire or develop or with which we may partner to fund our operations and recover our development costs.\nOur business plan involves the preparation and sale of our proprietary formulations through a network of compounding pharmacies and outsourcing facilities. We are in the process of establishing an internal sales force to pursue marketing and sales of our proprietary and other formulations in the states in which Pharmacy Creations and Park are authorized to operate under federal and state pharmacy laws. We are also pursuing additional strategic transactions to broaden our geographic reach, including our plans to open our own outsourcing facility in New Jersey, which is currently under construction that we expect to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our Company has limited experience operating pharmacies and commercializing compounded formulations and we may be unable to successfully manage this business or generate sufficient revenue to recover our development costs and operational expenses.\nWe may have only limited success in marketing and selling our proprietary formulations through any network of compounding pharmacies we may develop. Because any of our formulations being commercialized through a compounding pharmacy distribution model will not have obtained FDA approval, only limited data will be available, if any, with respect to the safety and efficacy of our formulations for any particular indication, and we will be subject to regulatory limitations with respect to the information we can provide regarding the safety and efficacy of our formulations even if such data is available. As a result, physicians may not be interested in prescribing our formulations to their patients, and we may not generate significant revenue from sales of our proprietary formulations and other products. In addition, we are substantially dependent on Pharmacy Creations, Park, any other pharmacies or prescription dispensing facilities we acquire or develop and any pharmacy partners with which we may contract to compound and sell our formulations in sufficient volumes to accommodate the number of prescriptions they receive. We may be unable to acquire, build or enter into agreements with pharmacies or outsourcing facilities of sufficient size, reputation and quality to implement our business plan, and our pharmacy partners may be unable to compound our formulations successfully. If physicians and healthcare organizations were to request our formulations in quantities our pharmacies or pharmacy partners are unable to fill, our business would suffer.\nOur business is significantly impacted by state and federal statutes and regulations.\nAll of our proprietary formulations are comprised of active pharmaceutical ingredients that are components of drugs that have received marketing approval from the FDA, although our proprietary compounded formulations have not themselves received FDA approval. FDA approval of a compounded formulation is not required in order to market and sell the compounded formulations, although in select instances we may choose to pursue FDA approval to market and sell certain potential product candidates. The marketing and sale of compounded formulations is subject to and must comply with extensive state and federal statutes and regulations governing compounding pharmacies. These statutes and regulations include, among other things, restrictions on compounding in advance of receiving a patient-specific prescription, prohibitions on compounding drugs that are essentially copies of FDA-approved drugs, prohibitions on compounding drug products for office use without a prescription for an individually identified patient, limitations on the volume of compounded formulations that may be sold across state lines, and prohibitions on wholesaling or reselling. These and other restrictions on the activities of compounding pharmacies may significantly limit the market available for compounded formulations, as compared to the market available for FDA-approved drugs.\nOur pharmacy business is impacted by federal and state laws and regulations governing, among other things: the purchase, distribution, management, compounding, dispensing, reimbursement, marketing and labeling of prescription drugs and related services; FDA and/or state regulation affecting the pharmacy and pharmaceutical industries, including state pharmacy licensure, registration or permit standards; rules and regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA and other state and federal laws related to the use, disclosure and transmission of health information; state and federal controlled substance laws; and statutes and regulations related to FDA approval for the sale and marketing of new drugs and medical devices. Our failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could severely limit or curtail our pharmacy operations, which would materially harm our business and prospects. Further, our business could be affected by changes in these or any newly enacted laws and regulations, as well as federal and state agency interpretations of such statutes and regulations. Such statutory or regulatory changes could require that we make changes to our business model and operations and/or could require that we incur significantly increased costs in order to comply with such regulations.\nIf Pharmacy Creations, Park or any other pharmacy or outsourcing facility we acquire or build or with which we partner fails to comply with the Controlled Substances Act, FDCA, or state statutes and regulations, the pharmacy could be required to cease operations or become subject to restrictions that could adversely affect our business.\nState pharmacy laws require pharmacy locations in those states to be licensed as an in-state pharmacy to dispense pharmaceuticals. In addition, state controlled substance laws require registration and compliance with state pharmacy licensure, registration or permit standards promulgated by the state\u2019s pharmacy licensing authority. Pharmacy and controlled substance laws often address the qualification of an applicant\u2019s personnel, the adequacy of its prescription fulfillment and inventory control practices and the adequacy of its facilities, and subject pharmacies to oversight by state boards of pharmacy and other regulators that could impose burdensome requirements or restrictions on operations if a pharmacy is found not to comply with these laws. For example, on May 14, 2014, Pharmacy Creations entered into a voluntary interim consent order with the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New Jersey and New Jersey State Board of Pharmacy related to its sterile compounding activities, pursuant to which Pharmacy Creations has agreed to conduct four additional mandatory third-party inspections by August 2015. Completing these additional third-party inspections will involve significant additional costs to us and will distract management and Pharmacy Creations employees from other aspects of our business. This consent order is not a disciplinary action or sanction or an admission of liability on the part of the pharmacy, and we believe that Pharmacy Creations is in material compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. However, if Pharmacy Creations or Park fails to comply with such requirements, it could be forced to permanently or temporarily cease or limit its sterile compounding operations, which would severely limit our ability to market and sell our proprietary formulations and would materially harm our operations and prospects. Any such noncompliance could also result in complaints or adverse actions by respective state boards of pharmacy, FDA inspection of the facility to determine compliance with the FDCA, loss of FDCA exemptions provided under Section 503A, warning letters, injunctions, prosecution, fines, loss of required government licenses, certifications and approvals, any of which could involve significant costs and could cause us to be unable to realize the expected benefits of these pharmacies\u2019 operations. Although we ultimately expect to distribute our proprietary formulations through a network of compounding pharmacies, we may not be successful in establishing such a network and the loss or limitation of Pharmacy Creation\u2019s or Park\u2019s ability to compound sterile formulations would have an immediate adverse impact on our ability to successfully and timely implement our business plan.\nMany of the states into which Pharmacy Creations and Park deliver pharmaceuticals have laws and regulations that require out-of-state pharmacies to register with, or be licensed by, the boards of pharmacy or similar regulatory bodies in those states. These states generally permit the dispensing pharmacy to follow the laws of the state within which the dispensing pharmacy is located. However, various state pharmacy boards have enacted laws and/or adopted rules or regulations directed at restricting the operation of out-of-state pharmacies by, among other things, requiring compliance with all laws of the states into which the out-of-state pharmacy dispenses medications, whether or not those laws conflict with the laws of the state in which the pharmacy is located, or requiring the pharmacist-in-charge to be licensed in that state. Further, under federal law Section 503A of the FDCA seeks to limit the amount of compounded products that a pharmacy can dispense interstate. The interpretation and enforcement of that provision is dependent on the FDA entering into a MOU with each state setting forth limits on interstate compounding. In February 2015, the FDA presented a draft MOU that, if adopted, and signed by states would limit the amount of interstate units dispensed from a compounding pharmacy to 30% of all compounded and non-compounded units dispensed or distributed by the pharmacy per month. This MOU, if adopted and signed by states, and any other state laws or requirements that may be enacted that prohibit or restrict the interstate operations of pharmacies could involve significant additional costs to us in order to sell compounded formulations in certain states and could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nThere are many competitive risks related to the marketing and sale of our proprietary formulations and operating a compounding pharmacy business.\nThe pharmaceutical and pharmacy industries are highly competitive. We compete against branded drug companies, generic drug companies, outsourcing facilities and other compounding pharmacies. We are significantly smaller than some of our competitors, and we may lack the financial and other resources needed to develop, produce, distribute, market and commercialize any of our proprietary formulations or compete for market share in these sectors. The drug products available through branded and generic drug companies with which our formulations compete have been approved for marketing and sale by the FDA and are required to be manufactured in facilities compliant with cGMP standards. Although we prepare our compounded formulations in accordance with the standards provided by USP <795> and USP <797> and applicable state and federal law, our proprietary compounded formulations are not required to be, and have not been, approved for marketing and sale by the FDA and, as a result, some physicians may be unwilling to prescribe, and some patients may be unwilling to use, our formulations. Additionally, under state and federal laws applicable to compounding pharmacies, we are not permitted to prepare significant amounts of a specific formulation in advance of a prescription, compound quantities for office use or utilize a wholesaler for distribution of our formulations; instead, our compounded formulations must be prepared and dispensed in connection with a physician prescription for an individually identified patient. Pharmaceutical companies, on the other hand, are able to sell their FDA-approved products to large pharmaceutical wholesalers, who can in turn sell to and supply hospitals and retail pharmacies. As a result, our business may not be scalable on the scope available to our competitors with FDA-approved drugs, which may limit our potential for profitable operations. These facets of our operations may subject our business to limitations our competitors with FDA-approved drugs may not face.\nBiotechnology and related pharmaceutical technologies have undergone and continue to be subject to rapid and significant change. Our future success, if any, will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies. Products developed by our competitors, including FDA-approved drugs and compounded formulations created by other pharmacies, could render our products and technologies obsolete or unable to compete. Any products that we develop may become obsolete before we recover expenses incurred in developing the products, which may require that we seek to raise additional funds to continue our operations that may or may not be available. The competitive environment requires an ongoing, extensive search for medical and technological innovations and the ability to develop and market these innovations effectively, and we may not be competitive with respect to these factors. Other competitive factors that may limit the success of our proprietary formulations include the size of the market for such products, which could be smaller than we expect, the timing of market entry relative to competitive products, the availability of alternative compounded formulations or approved drugs, the price of our formulations and services relative to these alternative products, the availability of third-party reimbursement and the success of our sales and marketing efforts. If our proprietary formulations are unable to compete with the products of our competitors, we may never gain market share or achieve profitability.\nIf a compounded drug formulation provided through our compounding services leads to patient injury or death or results in a product recall, we may be exposed to significant liabilities or reputational harm.\nThe success of our business, including our proprietary formulations and pharmacy operations, is highly dependent upon medical and patient perceptions of us and the safety and quality of our products. We could be adversely affected if we or any other compounding pharmacies or our formulations and technologies are subject to negative publicity. We could also be adversely affected if any of our formulations or technologies, any similar products sold by other companies, or any products sold by other compounding pharmacies prove to be, or are asserted to be, harmful to patients. For instance, to the extent any of the components of approved drugs or other ingredients used by Pharmacy Creations and Park to produce our compounded formulations have quality or other problems that adversely affect the finished compounded preparations, our business could be adversely affected. Also, because of our dependence upon medical and patient perceptions, any adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting from the use or misuse of our products, any similar products sold by other companies or any products sold by compounding pharmacies could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nTo assure compliance with USP guidelines, we have implemented a policy whereby 100% of all sterile compound batches produced by Pharmacy Creations and Park are tested both in-house and externally by an independent, FDA registered laboratory that we understand based on the laboratory\u2019s representations operates in compliance with current good laboratory practices prior to their delivery to patients and physicians. However, we could still become subject to product recalls and termination or suspension of our state pharmacy licenses if we fail to fully implement this policy, if the laboratory testing does not identify all contaminated products, or if our products otherwise cause or appear to have caused injury or harm to patients. In addition, such laboratory testing may produce false positives, which could harm our business and impact our pharmacy operations and licensure even if the impacted formulations are ultimately found to be sterile and no patients were harmed by them. If adverse events or deaths or a product recall, either voluntarily or as required by the FDA or a state board of pharmacy, were associated with one of our proprietary formulations or any compounds prepared by Pharmacy Creations, Park, or any other acquired or developed pharmacy or pharmacy partner, our reputation may suffer, physicians may be unwilling to prescribe our proprietary formulations or order any prescriptions from such pharmacies, we may become subject to product and professional liability lawsuits, or our state pharmacy licenses could be terminated or restricted. If any of these events were to occur, we may be subject to significant litigation or other costs and loss of revenue, and we may be unable to continue our pharmacy operations and further develop and commercialize our proprietary formulations.\nAlthough we have secured product and professional liability insurance for our pharmacy operations and the marketing and sale of our formulations, our current or future insurance coverage may prove insufficient to cover any liability claims brought against us. Because of the increasing costs of insurance coverage, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nOur ability to generate revenues will be diminished if we fail to obtain acceptable prices or an adequate level of reimbursement from third-party payors.\nCurrently, Pharmacy Creations and Park operate on mostly a cash-pay basis and do not submit large amounts of claims for reimbursement through Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, although our customers may choose to seek available reimbursement opportunities to the extent that they exist. We are currently in communications with third-party public and private payors regarding potential reimbursement options for certain of our proprietary formulations, but we may be unsuccessful in these efforts. Many third-party payors have imposed significant restrictions on reimbursement for compounded formulations in recent years. Additionally, even if we were to pursue and obtain FDA-approval for a particular product candidate, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products. Moreover, third-party payors, including Medicare, are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and by refusing, in some cases, to provide coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the FDA has not granted labeling approval. As a result, reimbursement from insurance companies and other third-party payors may never be available for any of our products or, if available, it may not be sufficient to allow us to sell the products on a competitive basis. If government and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for our formulations, the market acceptance for our formulations may be limited.\nWe may not be able to correctly estimate our future operating expenses, which could lead to cash shortfalls.\nOur estimates of our future operating and capital expenditures are based upon our current business plan, the anticipated expenses associated with our Pharmacy Creations and Park operations and our current expectations regarding the commercialization of our proprietary formulations. Our projections have varied significantly in the past as a result of changes to our business model and strategy, including our discontinuation of our historical Impracor program in November 2013, and our acquisitions of Pharmacy Creations, Park and product development opportunities. We have limited experience operating a pharmacy and commercializing compounded formulations, and we may not accurately estimate expenses and potential revenue associated with these activities. Additionally, our operating expenses may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including those discussed in this Item 1A, some of which are outside of our direct control. If we are unable to correctly estimate the amount of cash necessary to fund our business, we could spend our available financial resources much faster than we currently expect. If we do not have sufficient funds to continue to operate and develop our business, we could be required to seek additional financing earlier than we expect, which may not be available when needed or at all, or be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our proposed operations.\nHistorically we have relied on third party relationships to assist in our identification, research, assessment and acquisition of new formulations. If we do not successfully identify and acquire rights to potential formulations and successfully integrate them into our operations, our growth opportunities may be limited.\nWe expect our acquisition of Pharmacy Creations and Park to provide us with limited research and development support and access to additional novel compounded formulations. However, we have historically relied, and we expect to continue to rely, primarily upon third parties to provide us with additional opportunities. In 2013, we entered into three asset purchase agreements for development opportunities as a result of referrals from Professional Compounding Centers of America (PCCA) pursuant to our strategic alliance agreement with PCCA. Although the term of the strategic alliance agreement currently extends until February 18, 2016 and automatically extends for successive one year periods unless either party provides notice of non-renewal, we do not expect to obtain additional referrals and development opportunities through PCCA. In October 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Urigen that provides us with, in exchange for certain royalty and diligence obligations, development and commercialization rights in the U.S. with respect to HLA for the prevention and treatment of lower urinary tract disorders. We may seek to enter into similar arrangements with other third parties and for other formulations in the future, but only if we are able to identify attractive formulations and negotiate agreements with their owners on terms acceptable to us, which we may not be able to do. If we are unable to utilize Pharmacy Creations, Park and our current and future relationships with pharmacists, physicians and other inventors to provide us with additional development opportunities, our growth opportunities may be limited. Moreover, we have limited resources to acquire additional potential product development assets and integrate them into our business and acquisition opportunities may involve competition among several potential purchasers, which could include large multi-national pharmaceutical companies and other competitors that have access to greater financial resources than we do.\nOur pharmacist, physician and research consultants and advisors also provide us with significant assistance in our evaluation of product development opportunities. These third parties generally engage in other business activities and may not devote sufficient time and attention to our research and development activities. If these third parties were to terminate their relationships with us, we may be unable to find other, equally qualified consultants and advisors on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and we may have significant difficulty evaluating potential opportunities and developing and commercializing existing or any new product candidates. As a result, we face financial and operational risks and uncertainties in connection with any future product or technology acquisitions, and those we do complete may not be beneficial to us in the long term.\nWe may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize our proprietary formulations or any other assets we may acquire.\nOur future results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon our ability to successfully develop and commercialize in a timely manner any of the assets we have acquired or to which we will acquire rights in the future. We have entered into three asset purchase agreements for assets related to compoundable formulations and one license agreement for rights to commercialize a compounding formulation since May 2013. We are currently pursuing development and commercialization opportunities with respect to certain of these formulations and we are in the process of assessing certain of our other assets in order to determine whether to pursue their development or commercialization. In addition, we expect to consider the acquisition of additional intellectual property rights or other assets in the future. There are numerous difficulties and risks inherent in acquiring, developing and commercializing new formulations and product candidates, including the risks identified in this Item 1A.\nOnce we determine to pursue a potential product candidate, we develop a commercialization strategy for the product candidate. These commercialization strategies could include, among others, marketing and selling the formulation in compounded form through compounding pharmacies, or pursuing FDA approval of the product candidate. We may incorrectly assess the risks and benefits of our commercialization options with respect to one or more formulations or technologies, and we may not pursue a successful commercialization strategy. If we are unable to successfully commercialize one or more of our proprietary formulations, our operating results would be adversely affected. Even if we are able to successfully sell one or more proprietary formulations, we may never recoup our investment. Our failure to identify and expend our resources on formulations and technologies with commercial potential and execute an effective commercialization strategy for each of our formulations would negatively impact the long-term profitability of our business.\nWe may participate in strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses and distract our management.\nFrom time to time we consider strategic transactions, such as out-licensing or in-licensing of compounds or technologies, acquisitions of companies, and asset purchases. Additional potential transactions we may consider include a variety of different business arrangements, including strategic partnerships, joint ventures, spin-offs, restructurings, divestitures, business combinations and investments. In addition, another entity may pursue us or certain of our assets or aspects of our operations as an acquisition target. Any such transactions may require us to incur charges specific to the transaction and not incident to our operations, may increase our near and long-term expenditures, may pose significant integration challenges, and may require us to hire or otherwise engage personnel with additional expertise, any of which could harm our operations and financial results. Such transactions may also entail numerous other operational and financial risks, including, among others, exposure to unknown liabilities, disruption of our business and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention in order to develop acquired products, product candidates, technologies or businesses.\nAs part of our efforts to complete any significant transaction, we would need to expend significant resources to conduct business, legal and financial due diligence, with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in the transaction. Despite our efforts, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks and, as a result, we may not realize the expected benefits of any such transaction, whether due to unidentified risks, integration difficulties, regulatory setbacks or other events, and we may incur material liabilities for the past activities of acquired businesses. If any of these events were to occur, we could be subject to significant costs and damage to our reputation and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may need additional capital in order to continue operating our business, and such additional funds may not be available when needed, on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe only recently started generating cash from operations, but do not yet receive significant revenues from these operations. Although we believe we have sufficient cash reserves to operate our business for at least the next 12 months, we will need significant additional capital to execute our business plan and fund our proposed business operations. Additionally, our plans for this period may change, our estimates of our operating expenses and working capital requirements could be inaccurate, we may pursue acquisitions of pharmacies or other strategic transactions that involve one-time expenditures or we may experience growth more quickly or on a larger scale than we expect, any of which may result in the depletion of capital resources more rapidly than anticipated and could require us to seek additional financing earlier than we expect to support our operations.\nWe have raised $21.5 million in funds through equity financings since April 2012. We may seek to obtain additional capital through additional equity or debt financings, funding from corporate partnerships or licensing arrangements, sales or assets or other financing transactions. If additional capital is not available when necessary and on acceptable terms, we may need to forego pursuit of potentially valuable development or acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to continue to operate our business pursuant to our business plan or we may be forced to discontinue our operations entirely. If we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution, and the newly issued equity or debt securities may have more favorable terms or rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements or sales of assets, we may be required to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our product candidates or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we raise funds by incurring debt, we may be required to pay significant interest expenses and our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization may increase. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, would increase our liabilities and future cash commitments and may impose restrictions on our activities, such as financial or operational covenants with which we must comply. Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital and/or financing transactions, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we may issue, such as options, convertible notes and warrants, which would adversely impact our financial results.\nIf we are unable to establish, train and maintain an effective sales and marketing infrastructure, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates successfully.\nWe have started to build an internal sales and marketing infrastructure to implement our business plan with the development of internal sales teams and education campaigns to market our proprietary ophthalmology and urology formulations. We will need to expend significant resources to further establish and grow this internal infrastructure and properly train sales personnel with respect to regulatory compliance matters. We may also choose to engage third parties to provide sales and marketing services for us, either in place of or to supplement our internal commercialization infrastructure. We may not be able to secure sales personnel or relationships with third-party sales organizations that are adequate in number or expertise to successfully market and sell our proprietary formulations and pharmacy services. Further, any third-party organizations we may seek to engage may not be able to provide sales and marketing services in accordance with our expectations and standards, may be more expensive than we can afford or may not be available on otherwise acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to establish and maintain compliant and adequate sales and marketing capabilities, through our own internal infrastructure or third-party services, we may be unable to sell our formulations or services or generate revenue.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of cybersecurity and other system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of any third parties with which we partner are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such cybersecurity or system failure, accident or breach to date, if such an event were to occur, it could result in a material disruption of our operations, substantial costs to rectify or correct the failure, if possible, and potentially violation of HIPAA and other privacy laws applicable to our pharmacy operations. If any disruption or security breach resulted in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, further development of our proprietary formulations could be delayed, and our pharmacies could be disrupted, subject to restriction or forced to terminate their operations, any of which could severely harm our business and prospects.\nWe may be unable to demonstrate the safety and efficacy or obtain FDA regulatory approval to market and sell any product candidates for which we seek FDA approval.\nAlthough our current business strategy is focused on developing and commercializing product opportunities as compounded formulations, we may choose to seek FDA regulatory approval to market and sell one or more of our assets as a FDA-approved drug. The process of obtaining FDA approval to market and sell pharmaceutical products is costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. If we choose to pursue FDA approval for one or more product candidates, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may not approve the product candidate on a timely basis or at all. Before we could obtain FDA approval for the sale of any of our potential product candidates, we would be required to demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that the product candidate is safe and effective for each intended use. Preclinical and clinical studies may fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our potential product candidates. Even promising results from preclinical and early clinical studies do not accurately predict positive results in later, large-scale trials. A failure to demonstrate safety and efficacy of a product candidate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction would result in our failure to obtain FDA approval. Moreover, even if the FDA were to grant regulatory approval of a product candidate, the approval may be limited to specific therapeutic areas or limited with respect to its distribution, which could limit revenues, and we would be subject to extensive and costly post-approval requirements and oversight with respect to our commercialization of the product candidate.\nDelays in the conduct or completion of, or the termination of, any clinical and non-clinical trials for any product candidates for which we seek FDA approval could adversely affect our business.\nClinical trials are very expensive, time consuming, unpredictable and difficult to design and implement. The results of clinical trials may be unfavorable, they may continue for several years and may take significantly longer to complete and involve significantly more costs than expected. Delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could significantly affect our product development costs and business plan with respect to any product candidate for which we seek FDA approval. For example, we experienced significant difficulties and delays with respect to initiating our now-terminated former Phase 3 trial for Impracor. The commencement and completion of clinical trials can be delayed and experience difficulties for a number of reasons, including delays and difficulties caused by circumstances over which we may have no control. For instance, approvals of the scope, design or trial site may not be obtained from the FDA and other required bodies in a timely manner or at all, agreements with acceptable terms may not be reached with clinical research organizations (CROs) to conduct the trials, a sufficient number of subjects may not be recruited and enrolled in the trials, and third-party manufacturers of the materials for use in the trials may encounter delays and problems in the manufacturing process, including failure to produce materials in sufficient quantities or of an acceptable quality to complete the trials. If we were to experience delays in the commencement or completion of, or if we were to terminate, any clinical or non-clinical trials we pursue in the future, the commercial prospects for the applicable product candidates may be limited or eliminated, which may prevent us from recouping our investment on research and development efforts for the product candidate and would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe are dependent on third parties to conduct clinical trials and non-clinical studies of our formulations.\nWe do not employ personnel or possess the facilities necessary to conduct many of the activities associated with our non-clinical research activities or any clinical programs we may pursue in the future. We have engaged, and expect to continue to engage consultants, advisors, CROs and others to design, conduct, analyze and interpret the results of studies in connection with the research and development of our products. In addition, we have in the past provided and expect to continue to provide grants to physicians and other healthcare organizations to support investigator-initiated studies of our proprietary formulations. We generally have only very limited contractual rights in connection with the conduct of any such studies. In addition, if we were to participate in clinical trials conducted under an approved investigator-sponsored NDA, correspondence and communication with the FDA pertaining to these trials would strictly be between the investigator and the FDA. The communication and information provided by the investigator may not be appropriate and accurate, which could result in reviews, audits, delays or clinical holds by the FDA that affect the timelines for these studies and potentially risk the completion of these trials. As a result, many important aspects of any studies of our proprietary formulations and clinical or non-clinical trials for any drug candidates we determine to pursue are not in our direct control.\nIf the third parties we engage to perform these activities fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our studies, or if their performance is substandard, it would delay the introduction of our proprietary formulations to the market or the approval of our applications to regulatory agencies. Failure of these third parties to meet their obligations could adversely affect development of our proprietary formations and product candidates and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if we successfully develop any product candidate into an FDA-approved drug, failure to comply with continuing federal and state regulations could result in the loss of approvals to market the drug.\nEven if we successfully develop any product candidate into an FDA-approved drug, we would be subject to extensive continuing regulatory requirements and review, including review of adverse drug experiences and clinical results from any post-marketing tests or continued actions required as a condition of approval. The manufacturer and manufacturing facilities we would use to produce any such drug preparations would be subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA, and we would be reliant on these third parties to maintain their manufacturing processes in compliance with FDA and all other applicable regulatory requirements. Any changes to a product that may have achieved approval, including the way it is manufactured or promoted, would often require FDA approval before the product, as modified, could be marketed. In addition, we and our contract manufacturers would be subject to ongoing FDA requirements for submission of safety and other post-market information. If we or our contract manufacturers failed to comply with these or any other applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may, among other things, issue warning letters, impose civil or criminal penalties, suspend or withdraw regulatory approval, impose restrictions on our operations, close the facilities of our contract manufacturers, seize or detain products or require a product recall.\nRegulatory review also covers a company\u2019s activities in the promotion of its FDA-approved drugs, with significant potential penalties and restrictions for promotion of drugs for an unapproved use. Sales and marketing programs are under scrutiny for compliance with various mandated requirements, such as illegal promotions to health care professionals. We are also required to submit information on our open and completed clinical trials to public registries and databases. Failure to comply with these requirements could expose us to negative publicity, fines and penalties that could harm our business.\nWe are not pursuing further development of Impracor, our historical product candidate, and we do not expect to receive any revenue from Impracor.\nHistorically, our business was focused on developing and commercializing our product candidate Impracor under the regulatory pathway provided by Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. In August 2013, our contract manufacturer for the materials to be used in a proposed Phase 3 clinical trial of Impracor notified us that such materials had demonstrated out of specification and decreasing stability test results, which we believe could likely have resulted in the materials being unusable for the duration of the trial. After considering the totality of circumstances surrounding Impracor, including these unexpected manufacturing and formulation issues, other strategic and competitive considerations related to the Impracor program, the optimal use of our capital and other resources and other potential commercialization opportunities, we have discontinued the previously planned Phase 3 trial for Impracor and terminated all development programs for Impracor. We do not expect we will identify or pursue a successful commercialization pathway for Impracor. Even if we were to pursue commercialization of Impracor or sell compounded formulations utilizing the Impracor technology through our pharmacy operations, we would not expect to achieve sales and revenues necessary to recover our historical costs associated with the Impracor development program.\nIf we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, we may not be able to prevent others from using our intellectual property, which may reduce the competitiveness and value of the related assets.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our formulations and technologies and prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights. We must also operate without infringing upon patents and proprietary rights of others, including by obtaining appropriate licenses to patents or proprietary rights held by third parties if necessary. We will only be able to protect our formulations and technologies from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents cover them. As of March 2, 2015, we owned 12 U.S. patent applications, including nine utility and three provisional patent applications, and we owned five international patent applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. However, the applications we have filed or may file may never yield patents that protect our inventions and intellectual property assets. Failure to obtain patents for our formulations and technologies would limit our protection against other compounding pharmacies and outsourcing facilities, generic drug manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies and other parties who may seek to copy or otherwise produce products substantially similar to ours or use technologies substantially similar to those we own. We have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments in certain of our proprietary formulations prior to the grant of any patents covering these formulations, and we may not receive a sufficient return on these investments in patents or other appropriate intellectual property protection in not obtained and their competitiveness and value decreases.\nThe patent and intellectual property positions of pharmacies and pharmaceutical companies, including ours, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. There is no guarantee that we have or will develop or obtain the rights to products or processes that are patentable, that patents will issue from any pending applications or that claims allowed will be sufficient to protect the technology we develop or have developed or to which we have acquired rights, our contract manufacturing organizations or our other service providers. In addition, we cannot be certain that patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented, including by our competitors, or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us.\nWe also rely on unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation in order to develop our formulations, which we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators and others. We also have invention or patent assignment agreements with our current employees and certain consultants. However, our employees and consultants may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, or our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. In addition, inventions relevant to us could be developed by a person not bound by an invention assignment agreement with us, in which case we may have no rights to use the applicable invention.\nWe may face additional competition outside of the U.S. as a result of a lack of patent coverage in some territories and differences in patent prosecution and enforcement laws in foreign counties.\nFiling, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patents on our proprietary formulations throughout the world is extremely expensive. While we have filed five international patent applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, we do not currently have patent protection outside of the U.S. that covers any of our proprietary formulations or other assets that we are currently pursuing. Competitors may use our technologies to develop their own products in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection. These products may compete with ours and may not be covered by any of our patent claims or other intellectual property rights.\nEven if we were to file international patent applications for any of our current or future proprietary formulations and patents were issued or approved, it is likely that the scope of protection provided by such patents would be different from, and possibly less than, the scope provided by corresponding U.S. patents. The success of our international market opportunity would be dependent upon the enforcement of patent rights in various other countries. A number of countries in which we could file patent applications have a history of weak enforcement and/or compulsory licensing of intellectual property rights. Moreover, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology and/or pharmaceuticals, which would make it difficult for us to stop a party from infringing any of our intellectual property rights. Even if we have patents issued in these jurisdictions, our patent rights may not be sufficient to prevent generic competition or unauthorized use. Moreover, attempting to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nOur proprietary formulations and technologies could potentially conflict with the rights of others.\nThe preparation or sale of our proprietary formulations and use of our technologies may infringe on the patent rights of others. If our products infringe or conflict with the patent or other intellectual property rights of others, third parties could bring legal actions against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin our manufacturing and marketing of affected products. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming and may divert management\u2019s attention and our resources. We may not have sufficient resources to bring any such actions to a successful conclusion. If we are not successful in defending against these legal actions should they arise, we may be subject to monetary liability, be forced to alter our products or cease some or all of our operations relating to the affected products, or seek to obtain a license in order to continue manufacturing and marketing the affected products, which may not available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe are dependent on our CEO, Mark L. Baum, for the continued growth and development of our Company.\nOur CEO, Mark L. Baum, has played a primary role in creating and developing our current business model. Further, Mr. Baum has played a primary role in securing much of our material intellectual property rights and related assets, as well as the means to make and distribute our current products. We are highly dependent on Mr. Baum for the implementation of our business plan and the future development of our assets and our business, and the loss of Mr. Baum\u2019s services to and leadership of our Company would likely materially adversely impact the Company. We presently do not have key man insurance for Mr. Baum.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and consultants, we may be unable to maintain or expand our business.\nWe terminated all of our employees following our filing of the Chapter 11 Case. Since the dismissal of the Chapter 11 Case in December 2011, we have developed a new business model and have focused on rebuilding our management, pharmacy, research and development, sales and marketing and other personnel in order to pursue this business model. However, because of our history, we may have significant difficulty attracting and retaining necessary employees. In addition, because of the specialized nature of our business, our ability to develop products and to compete will remain highly dependent, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain qualified pharmacy, scientific, technical and commercial employees and consultants. The loss of key employees or consultants or the failure to recruit or engage new employees and consultants could have a material adverse effect on our business. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in our industry, and we may be unable to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.\nWe depend upon consultants and outside contractors for key aspects of our business.\nWe are substantially dependent on consultants and other outside contractors and service providers for key aspects of our business, including our research and development activities. Our agreements with our consultants typically provide that the consultant may terminate the agreement with advanced notice to us. If any of our consultants terminates their engagement with us, or we are unable to engage highly qualified replacements as necessary for our business, we may be unable to successfully execute our business plan. We must effectively manage these consultants to ensure that they successfully carry out their contractual obligations and meet expected deadlines. However, if we are unable to effectively manage our outsourced activities or if the quality or accuracy of the services provided by consultants is compromised for any reason, our development activities may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to commercialize our formulations or advance our business. We may not be able to manage our existing consultants or find other competent outside contractors and service providers on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nChanges in the healthcare industry that are beyond our control may have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe healthcare industry is changing rapidly as consumers, governments, medical professionals and the pharmaceutical industry examine ways to broaden medical coverage while controlling the increase in healthcare costs. Such changes could include changes to make the government\u2019s Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement programs more restrictive, which could limit or curtail the potential for our proprietary formulations to obtain eligibility for reimbursement from such payors, or changes to expand the reach of HIPAA or other health privacy laws, which could make compliance with these laws more costly and burdensome. Further, the Health Reform Law may have a considerable impact on the existing U.S. system for the delivery and financing of health care and conceivably could have a material effect on our business, although the details for implementation of many of the requirements under the Health Reform Law will depend on the promulgation of regulations by a number of federal government agencies. It is impossible to predict the final requirements of the Health Reform Law, any other changes to laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry, or the net effect of these requirements or changes on our business, operations or financial performance.\nBecause of their significant stock ownership, some of our existing stockholders are able to exert control over us and our significant corporate decisions, and sales of common stock by these stockholders from time to time could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nOur executive officers and directors own or have the right to acquire within 60 days after March 10, 2015, in the aggregate, approximately 17% of our common stock that would be outstanding following such issuances. In addition, five individual stockholders own, or have the right to acquire within 60 days after March 10, 2015, an additional approximately 41% of our common stock that would be outstanding following such issuances. The sale of even a portion of these shares, or the perception that such sales may occur, would likely have a material adverse effect on our stock price. In addition, these persons, acting together, have the ability to exercise significant influence over or control the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and any significant transaction involving us, and to control our management and affairs. Additionally, since our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws permit our stockholders to act by written consent, a limited number of stockholders may approve stockholder actions without holding a meeting of stockholders. This concentration of ownership may harm the market price of our common stock by, among other things:\n\u25cf\ndelaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of our Company or changes to our board of directors;\n\u25cf\nimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving our Company;\n\u25cf\ncausing us to enter into transactions or agreements that are not in the best interests of all stockholders; or\n\u25cf\ndiscouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our Company.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports, our operating results could be misstated, our reputation may be harmed and the trading price of our stock could decline. As we discuss in Item 9A of this Annual Report, our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2014. However, our controls over financial processes and reporting may not continue to be effective, or we may identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls in the future. Any failure to remediate any future material weaknesses or implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements or other public disclosures. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nA consistently active trading market for shares of our common stock may not be sustained.\nHistorically, trading in our common stock has been sporadic and volatile, and our common stock has been \u201cthinly-traded.\u201d There have been, and may in the future continue to be, extended periods when trading activity in our shares is minimal, as compared to a seasoned issuer with a large and steady volume of trading activity. The market for our common stock is also characterized by significant price volatility compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that such volatility will continue. As a result, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares may disproportionately influence the market price of our common stock. It is possible that a consistently active and liquid trading market in our securities may never develop or be sustained.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf\nchanges in the pharmacy and pharmaceutical industry and markets;\n\u25cf\ncompetitive pricing pressures;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain working capital financing;\n\u25cf\nnew competitors in our market;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nlimited \u201cpublic float\u201d in the hands of a small number of persons whose sales or lack of sales could result in positive or negative pricing pressure on the market price for our common stock;\n\u25cf\nsales of our common stock by us or by stockholders;\n\u25cf\nour ability to execute our business plan;\n\u25cf\noperating results that fall below expectations;\n\u25cf\nloss of any material strategic relationships;\n\u25cf\nindustry or regulatory developments;\n\u25cf\neconomic and other external factors; and\n\u25cf\nthe other risk factors affecting our business discussed in this Item 1A.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have the right to issue shares of preferred stock. If we were to issue preferred stock, it would likely have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of our common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, with such rights, preferences and privileges as may be determined from time-to-time by our board of directors. Following the conversion of our Series A Preferred Stock on June 29, 2012, we have no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. Our board of directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the dividend rights, dissolution or liquidation preferences, redemption prices, conversion rights, voting rights, and other rights, preferences and privileges for any series of our preferred stock. We have no immediate plans to issue shares of preferred stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock, depending on the rights, preferences and privileges attributable to the preferred stock, could adversely reduce the voting rights and powers of the common stock and the portion of our assets allocated for distribution to common stockholders in a liquidation event, and could also result in dilution to the book value per share of our common stock. The preferred stock could also be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method for raising additional capital or discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nThe sale by our stockholders of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur upon the expiration of any statutory holding period, such as under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) upon expiration of any lock-up periods applicable to outstanding shares, or upon our issuance of shares upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, could cause the market price of our common stock to fall. The availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make it more difficult for us to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.", "PERMNO": 13796, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "HROW"}
