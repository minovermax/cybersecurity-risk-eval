{"cik": "714395", "company": "GERMAN AMERICAN BANCORP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following describes some of the principal risks and uncertainties to which our industry in general, and our securities, assets and businesses specifically, are subject; other risks are briefly identified in our cautionary statement that is included under the heading \u201cForward-Looking Statements and Associated Risks\u201d in Part I, Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d Although we seek ways\nto manage these risks and uncertainties and to develop programs to control those that we can, we ultimately cannot predict the future. Future results may differ materially from past results, and from our expectations and plans.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread have adversely impacted the Company\u2019s business and financial results, and the continued impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the severity and duration of the pandemic and further actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties to contain and treat the virus.\nCOVID-19, which has been identified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization and declared a national emergency in the United States, continues to cause disruptions in the global economy (including the states and local economies in which we operate) and instability in financial markets. The outbreak resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place or total lock-down orders and business limitations and shutdowns. Such measures, which could be implemented again in the future, significantly contributed to rising unemployment and negatively impacted consumer and business spending. As a result, the demand for the Company\u2019s products and services has been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted. Furthermore, the pandemic has caused, and could continue to influence, the recognition of credit losses in the Company\u2019s loan portfolio as customers are negatively impacted by economic conditions. The Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses is also subject to further change as customers are impacted by economic fluctuations resulting from the pandemic. In addition, governmental actions taken in response to COVID-19 have resulted in decreased interest rates and yields, which have adversely impacted the Company's interest margins and which may lead to decreases in the Company\u2019s net interest income.\nAs our banking regulators encouraged us to work prudently with borrowers who are unable to meet their contractual payment obligations due to the effects of COVID-19, the Bank provided certain hardship relief primarily in the form of payment deferrals. As a result, the Bank has made short-term loan modifications for borrowers who are current and otherwise not past due. As provided under the CARES Act and extended by the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act, these qualified loan modifications were exempt by law from classification as troubled debt restructures, as defined by GAAP, through January 1, 2022. The potential adverse impact resulting from the inability of these borrowers to repay loans on a timely basis cannot be determined at this time. However, the extent of such impact, as reflected in the Company\u2019s financial statements, may have been muted by these loan modifications, which could have the effect of having delayed loss recognition until after the deferral period.\nThe spread of COVID-19 caused the Company to modify its business practices (including developing work from home and social distancing plans for our employees), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or will otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s business operations have been, and may again in the future be, disrupted due to vendors and third-party service providers being unable to work or provide services effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as its regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic, the potential for seasonal or other resurgences, actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties to contain and treat the virus, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Moreover, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may heighten many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. While we do not yet know the full extent of its impact, the pandemic could cause us to experience higher credit losses in our lending portfolio, impairment of our goodwill and other financial assets, reduced demand for our products and services, and other negative impacts on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, which could be material.\nAs a participating lender in the SBA Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), the Company and the Bank are subject to additional risks of litigation from the Bank\u2019s clients or other parties in connection with the Bank\u2019s processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties.\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act established the PPP, which is administered by the SBA, to fund payroll and operational costs of eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons during the pandemic. The Bank actively participated in assisting its customers with PPP funding during all phases of the program. Because of the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and the April 3, 2020 opening of the PPP, there was some ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the program, which exposes the Company to risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP.\nSince the opening of the PPP, several larger banks have been subject to litigation relating to the policies and procedures that they used in processing applications for the PPP. The Company and the Bank may be exposed to the risk of litigation, from both customers and non-customers that have approached the Bank in connection with PPP loans and its policies and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. If any such litigation is filed against the Company or the Bank and is not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company or the Bank, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP-related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank also has credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Bank, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Company, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the Bank.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has increased cyber-security risks.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has introduced additional risk to our information systems and security procedures, controls and policies as a result of employees, contractors and other corporate partners working remotely. As a result of an increased remote workforce, we have increasingly relied on information technology systems that are outside our direct control, and these systems are also vulnerable to cyber-based attacks and security breaches. In addition, since the beginning of pandemic, there has been an increase attacks by cyber criminals on businesses and individuals, utilizing interest in pandemic-related information and the fear and uncertainty caused by the pandemic to increase phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks designed to trick victims into transferring sensitive data or funds, steal credentials or deploy malware that compromises information systems. If one of our employees were to fall victim to one of these attacks, or our information technology systems are compromised, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer financial loss, reputational loss, loss of customer business or other critical assets, or become exposed to regulatory fines and intervention or civil litigation.\nRisks Related to the Financial Services Industry\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and changes in laws and regulations to which we are subject may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe banking industry in which we operate is subject to extensive regulation and supervision under federal and state laws and regulations. The restrictions imposed by such laws and regulations limit the manner in which we conduct our business, undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing. These regulations are designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers and not to benefit our shareholders.\nSince its passage in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act (discussed in \u201cBusiness - Regulation and Supervision\u201d of Item 1 above) has resulted in sweeping changes in the regulation of financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act contains numerous provisions that affect all banks and bank holding companies. While many of these provisions have been implemented, others are still being drafted. As a result, the impact of the future regulatory requirements continues to be uncertain. However, we expect the way we conduct business to continue to be affected by these regulatory requirements, including through limitations on our ability to pursue certain lines of business, enhanced reporting obligations, increased costs (which adversely affect our profitability) and increased risk that we might not comply in all respects with the new requirements.\nIn addition, significant new laws or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws (including changes in federal or state laws affecting corporate taxpayers generally or financial institutions specifically) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Further, federal monetary policy, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve System, significantly affects credit conditions, and any unfavorable change in these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nWe are required to maintain certain minimum amounts and types of capital and may be subject to more stringent capital requirements in the future. A failure to meet applicable capital requirements could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital that we must maintain. From time to time, banking regulators change these capital adequacy guidelines. For example, as a result of the Basel III Rules required by\nthe Dodd-Frank Act, we are now required to satisfy additional, more stringent, capital adequacy standards than we had in the past. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation and Supervision, Capital Requirements\u201d of Item 1 above for additional information. We currently satisfy the well-capitalized and capital conservation standards set forth in Basel III, and based on our current capital composition and levels, we anticipate that our capital ratios, on a Basel III basis, will continue to exceed the well-capitalized minimum capital requirements and capital conservation buffer standards. However, a failure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a negative impact on our ability to lend, grow deposit balances, make acquisitions or make capital distributions in the form of dividends. Higher capital levels could also lower our return on equity.\nOur FDIC insurance premiums may increase, and special assessments could be made, which might negatively impact our results of operations.\nHigh levels of insured institution failures, as a result of the recent recession, significantly increased losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act mandated the FDIC to increase the level of its reserves for future losses in its Deposit Insurance Fund. Since the Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by premiums and assessments paid by insured banks, our FDIC insurance premium could increase in future years depending upon the FDIC\u2019s actual loss experience, changes in our Bank\u2019s financial condition or capital strength, and future conditions in the banking industry.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Financial Strategies\nEconomic weakness in our geographic markets could negatively affect us.\nWe conduct business from offices that are located in 19 contiguous southern Indiana counties and 14 counties in Kentucky, from which substantially all of our customer base is drawn. Because of the geographic concentration of our operations and customer base, our results depend largely upon economic conditions in this area. Any material deterioration in the economic conditions in these markets could have direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us, or on our customers or on the financial institutions with whom we deal as counterparties to financial transactions. Such deterioration could negatively impact customers\u2019 ability to obtain new loans or to repay existing loans, diminish the values of any collateral securing such loans and could cause increases in the number of the Company\u2019s customers experiencing financial distress and in the levels of the Company\u2019s delinquencies, non-performing loans and other problem assets, charge-offs and provision for credit losses, all of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The underwriting and credit monitoring policies and procedures that we have adopted cannot eliminate the risk that we might incur losses on account of factors relating to the economy like those identified above, and those losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our actual loan losses exceed our estimates, our earnings and financial condition will be impacted.\nA significant source of risk for any bank or other enterprise that lends money arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers, guarantors and related parties may fail (because of financial difficulties or other reasons) to perform in accordance with the terms of their loan agreements. In our case, we originate many loans that are secured, but some loans are unsecured depending on the nature of the loan. With respect to secured loans, the collateral securing the repayment of these loans includes a wide variety of real and personal property that may be insufficient to cover the obligations owed under such loans, due to adverse changes in collateral values caused by changes in prevailing economic, environmental and other conditions, including declines in the value of real estate and other external events.\nWe have adopted new accounting guidance, specifically the current expected credit loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) standard, to account for our credit losses that may be more volatile and may adversely impact our financial statements when forecasted market conditions change.\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which replaces the incurred loss model with an expected loss model, which is referred to as the current expected credit loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) model. The CECL model is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, and reinsurance receivables. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the incurred loss model, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. As a result, the CECL model may create more volatility in our earnings and the level of our allowance for credit losses.\nOur allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for the expected credit losses over the contractual life of the loan portfolio as well as unfunded loan commitments. The Company estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for changes in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, changes in environmental conditions, unemployment rates, risk classifications and collateral values. We have also included assumptions about the severity and duration of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our borrowers, their industry, and on economic conditions in general, all of which are highly uncertain and for which we have no historical experience to draw upon. If our assumptions and judgments used to determine the allowance for credit losses prove to be incorrect, the allowance may not be adequate. We could sustain actual loan losses that are significantly higher than the amount of our allowance for credit losses.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates.\nOur earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, demand for loans, securities and deposits, and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the monetary policies of the FRB. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. We maintain an investment portfolio consisting of various high quality liquid fixed-income securities. The nature of fixed-income securities is such that increases in prevailing market interest rates negatively impact the value of these securities, while decreases in prevailing market interest rates positively impact the value of these securities. Any substantial, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate may have an impact on the our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCertain loans made by us and financing extended to us are made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. In addition, we also have interest rate derivatives that reference LIBOR. After first announcing its intention to do so in July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, the authority regulating LIBOR, announced in March 2021 that, among other things: (i) a majority of the current LIBOR rate settings would cease to exist immediately after December 31, 2021 (including the 1-week and 2-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings); and (ii) the 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings would cease to exist after June 30, 2023.\nTo identify a successor rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the \u201cARRC\u201d), a U.S.-based group convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was formed. On July 29, 2021, the ARRC formally identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. As such, it is different from LIBOR in that it is a backward looking secured rate rather than a forward looking unsecured rate.\nAt this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes, any establishment of alternative reference rates or other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the United States, the United Kingdom or elsewhere or, whether the COVID-19 outbreak will have further effect on LIBOR transition plans. Any replacement interest rate(s) may perform differently and we may incur significant costs to transition both our borrowing arrangements and the loan agreements with our customers from LIBOR, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, amending certain contracts indexed to LIBOR may require consent from impacted counterparties which could be difficult to obtain. The financial and operational impact of the transition is unknown at this time. As federal banking regulators required banks to stop originating new products using LIBOR by December 31, 2021, the Bank began using alternative indices, including SOFR, in originating new loans or other products following such date.\nThe banking and financial services business in our markets is highly competitive.\nWe compete with much larger regional, national, and international competitors, including competitors that have no (or only a limited number of) offices physically located within our markets, many of which compete with us via Internet and other electronic product and service offerings. In addition, banking and other financial services competitors (including newly organized companies) that are not currently represented by physical locations within our geographic markets could establish office facilities within our markets, including through their acquisition of existing competitors. Financial technology, or\n\u201cFinTech,\u201d companies continue to emerge in key areas of banking. Our competitors may have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not or cannot provide. Many of our nonfinancial institution competitors have fewer regulatory constraints, broader geographic service areas, and, in some cases, lower cost structures. Increased competition in our market may also result in a decrease in the amounts of our loans and deposits, reduced spreads between loan rates and deposit rates or loan terms that are more favorable to the borrower. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. See also \u201cBusiness - Competition\u201d and \u201cBusiness - Regulation and Supervision\u201d under Item 1 of Part I of this Report.\nThe manner in which we report our financial condition and results of operations may be affected by accounting changes.\nOur financial condition and results of operations that are presented in our consolidated financial statements, accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements, and selected financial data appearing in this Report, are, to a large degree, dependent upon our accounting policies. The selection of and application of these policies involve estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are subject to change, and the effect of any change in estimates or judgments that might be caused by future developments or resolution of uncertainties could be materially adverse to our reported financial condition and results of operations. In addition, authorities that prescribe accounting principles and standards for public companies from time to time change those principles or standards or adopt formal or informal interpretations of existing principles or standards. Such changes or interpretations (to the extent applicable to us) could result in changes that would be materially adverse to our reported financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in tax laws.\nAny change in federal or state tax laws or regulations, including any increase in the federal corporate income tax rate from the current level of 21%, could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of securities or loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or the terms of which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and borrowings as necessary, we might not be able to replace such funds in the future if, among other things, our results of operations or financial condition or the results of operations or financial condition of our lenders or market conditions were to change.\nThe value of securities in our investment securities portfolio may be negatively affected by disruptions in securities markets.\nPrices and volumes of transactions in the nation\u2019s securities markets can be affected suddenly by economic crises, or by other national or international crises, such as national disasters, acts of war or terrorism, changes in commodities markets, or instability in foreign governments. Disruptions in securities markets may detrimentally affect the value of securities that we hold in our investment portfolio, such as through reduced valuations due to the perception of heightened credit and liquidity risks. There can be no assurance that declines in market value associated with these disruptions will not result in other than temporary impairments of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount due us.\nWe are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel could harm our business.\nCompetition for qualified employees and personnel in the financial services industry (including banking personnel, trust and investments personnel, and insurance personnel) is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of and experience in our local markets. Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain\nqualified loan origination executives, sales executives for our trust and investment products and services, and sales executives for our insurance products and services. We also depend upon the continued contributions of our management personnel, and in particular upon the abilities of our senior executive management, and the loss of the services of one or more of them could harm our business.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur methods of reducing risk exposure may not be effective.\nThe Company maintains a comprehensive risk management program designed to identify, quantify, manage, mitigate, monitor, aggregate, and report risks. However, instruments, systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, financial reporting and strategic risks could be less effective than anticipated. As a result, the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For more information regarding risk management, please see \u201cRISK MANAGEMENT\u201d under Item 7 of this Report (\u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d).\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title.\nIn the course of our business, we may own or foreclose and take title to real estate, and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties (including liabilities for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination), or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property.\nClimate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may materially affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe global business community has increased its political and social awareness surrounding the state of the global environment and the issue climate change. Further, the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies continue to propose numerous initiatives related to climate change. Similar and even more expansive initiatives are expected under the current administration, including potentially increasing supervisory expectations with respect to banks\u2019 risk management practices, accounting for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systemic risk assessments, revising expectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climate-related factors and encouraging investment by banks in climate-related initiatives and lending to communities disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change. The lack of empirical data surrounding the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change make it impossible to predict how specifically climate change may impact our financial condition and results of operations. To the extent our customers experience unpredictable and more frequent weather disasters attributable to climate change, the value of real property securing the loans in our portfolios may be negatively impacted. Additionally, if insurance obtained by our borrowers is insufficient to cover any disaster-related losses sustained to the collateral, or if insurance coverage is otherwise unavailable to our borrowers, the collateral securing our loans may be negatively impacted, which could impact our financial condition and results of operations. Further, the effects of weather disasters attributed to climate change may negatively impact regional and local economic activity, which could lead to an adverse effect on our customers and impact the communities in which we operate. Overall, climate change, its effects and the resulting, unknown impact could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to the Company\u2019s environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on the Company or expose it to new or additional risks.\nCompanies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, health and safety, diversity, labor conditions and human rights. Increased ESG-related compliance costs for the Company as well as among our suppliers, vendors and various other parties within our supply chain could result in increases to our overall operational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could\nnegatively impact our reputation, ability to do business with certain partners, access to capital, and our stock price. New government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe face significant operational risks due to the high volume and the high dollar value nature of transactions we process.\nWe operate in many different businesses in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of our internal control systems or failures of those of our suppliers or counterparties, compliance failures, cyber-attacks or unforeseen problems encountered while implementing new computer systems or upgrades to existing systems, business continuation and disaster recovery issues, and other external events. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. The occurrence of any of these events could cause us to suffer financial loss, face regulatory action and suffer damage to our reputation.\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information, whether through a cyber-attack, other breach of our computer systems or otherwise, could harm our business.\nIn the normal course of our business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential client and customer information on our behalf and on behalf of other third parties. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and / or human errors, or other similar events.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions like us have increased recently in part because of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. In addition to cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers recently have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions, particularly denial of service attacks, designed to disrupt key business services such as customer-facing web sites. We may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types. Although we employ detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents, early detection may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection.\nWe also face risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches in connection with credit card transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding our customers through various third parties. Some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyber-attacks, and because the transactions involve third parties and environments that we do not control or secure, future security breaches or cyber-attacks affecting any of these third parties could impact us through no fault of our own, and in some cases we may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them. We also rely on numerous other third party service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations and face similar risks relating to them. We cannot be sure that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyber-attack or other security breach.\nAny cyber-attack or other security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information could severely damage our reputation, erode confidence in the security of our systems, products and services, expose us to the risk of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption, or security breach of our information systems, we cannot completely ensure that any such failures, interruptions, or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in\na loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon third parties for certain information system, data management and processing services and to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nWe outsource certain information system and data management and processing functions to third party providers. These third party service providers are sources of operational and informational security risk to us, including risks associated with operational errors, information system interruptions or breaches, and unauthorized disclosures of sensitive or confidential client or customer information. If third party service providers encounter any of these issues, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, we could be exposed to disruption of operations, loss of service or connectivity to customers, reputational damage, and litigation risk that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or our business.\nThird party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and core application processing.\nWhile we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise to conduct our business. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nRisks Relating to Expansion of Our Businesses by Acquisition\nAny acquisitions of banks, bank branches, or loans or other financial service assets pose risks to us.\nWe may acquire other banks, bank branches and other financial-service-related businesses and assets in the future. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired assets, operations or company;\n\u2022exposure to potential asset quality issues of the acquired assets, operations or company;\n\u2022environmental liability with acquired real estate collateral or other real estate;\n\u2022difficulty and expense of integrating the operations, systems and personnel of the acquired assets, operations or company;\n\u2022potential disruption to our ongoing business, including diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention;\n\u2022the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired operations or company;\n\u2022difficulty in estimating the value of the acquired assets, operations or company; and\n\u2022potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the acquired assets, operations or company.\nWe may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with mergers or acquisitions.\nAcquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of the Company\u2019s tangible book value per common share or net income per common share (or both) may occur in connection with any future transaction.\nWe may incur substantial costs to expand by acquisition, and such acquisitions may not result in the levels of profits we seek.\nIntegration efforts for any future acquisitions may not be successful and following any future acquisition, after giving it effect, we may not achieve financial results comparable to or better than our historical experience.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock price may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell our common stock at times or at prices acceptable to you.\nOur common stock price constantly changes in response to a variety of factors (some of which are beyond our control), and we expect that our stock price will continue to fluctuate in the future. Factors impacting the price of our common stock include, among others:\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022recommendations or research reports about us or the financial services industry in general published by securities analysts;\n\u2022the failure of securities analysts to cover, or continue to cover, us;\n\u2022operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us;\n\u2022news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry;\n\u2022perceptions in the marketplace regarding us, or our reputation, competitors or other financial institutions;\n\u2022actual or anticipated sales of our equity or equity-related securities;\n\u2022our past and future dividend practice;\n\u2022departure of our management team or other key personnel;\n\u2022new technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;\n\u2022existing or increased regulatory and compliance requirements, changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations, or differing interpretations thereof affecting our business, or enforcement of these laws and regulations; and\n\u2022litigation and governmental investigations.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events (including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, other economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends) could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.", "PERMNO": 79166, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "GABC"}
