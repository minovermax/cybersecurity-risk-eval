{"cik": "1351051", "company": "Genesis Healthcare, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nStatements made by us in this report and in other reports and statements released by us that are not historical facts constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 21 of the Exchange Act. Statements that use words such as \"believe,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"could,\" \"plan,\" \"expect,\" \"project\" or the negative of these, as well as similar expressions, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are necessarily estimates and expectations reflecting the best judgment of our senior management based on our current estimates, expectations, forecasts and projections, and include comments that express our current opinions about trends and factors that may impact future\noperating results. Such statements rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events, many of which are outside of our control, and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements, expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Any such forward-looking statements, whether made in this report or elsewhere, should be considered in the context of the various disclosures made by us about our business and other matters including, without limitation, the risk factors discussed below. We expressly disclaim any duty to update the forward-looking statements and other information contained in this report, except as required by law.\nWe operate in a rapidly changing and highly regulated environment that involves a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are highlighted below and others are discussed elsewhere in this report. In addition, we may be exposed to risks relating to our Combination with FC-GEN. These risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects, operating results or cash flows. The following risk factors are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, natural disasters, general economic conditions and geopolitical events. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nReductions in Medicare reimbursement rates, or changes in the rules governing the Medicare program could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe receive a significant portion of our revenue from Medicare, which accounted for 28.4% of our consolidated revenue during 2014 and 30.9% in 2013. In addition, many private payors base their reimbursement rates on the published Medicare rates or, in the case of our rehabilitation therapy services customers, are themselves reimbursed by Medicare for the services we provide. Accordingly, if Medicare reimbursement rates are reduced or fail to increase as quickly as our costs, or if there are changes in the rules governing the Medicare program that are disadvantageous to our business or industry, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nThe Medicare program and its reimbursement rates and rules are subject to frequent change. These include statutory and regulatory changes, rate adjustments (including retroactive adjustments), administrative or executive orders and government funding restrictions, all of which may materially adversely affect the rates at which Medicare reimburses us for our services. For example, CMS implemented a net 11.1% reduction in its reimbursement rates to skilled nursing facilities effective October 1, 2011. Furthermore, due to the federal sequestration, an automatic 2% reduction in Medicare spending took effect beginning in April 2013 and will remain in effect unless Congress takes action to terminate the automatic reduction or authorize spending increases. Budget pressures often lead the federal government to reduce or place limits on reimbursement rates under Medicare. Implementation of these and other types of measures has in the past and could in the future result in substantial reductions in our revenue and operating margins. Prior reductions in governmental reimbursement rates partially contributed to our predecessor's bankruptcy filing under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in October 2001.\nIn addition, the federal government often changes the rules governing the Medicare program, including those governing reimbursement. Changes that could adversely affect our business include:\n\u2022\nadministrative or legislative changes to base rates or the bases of payment;\n\u2022\nlimits on the services or types of providers for which Medicare will provide reimbursement;\n\u2022\nchanges in methodology for patient assessment and/or determination of payment levels;\n\u2022\nthe reduction or elimination of annual rate increases; or\n\u2022\nan increase in co-payments or deductibles payable by beneficiaries.\nGiven the history of frequent revisions to the Medicare program and its reimbursement rates and rules, we may not continue to receive reimbursement rates from Medicare that sufficiently compensate us for our services or, in some instances, cover our operating costs. Limits on reimbursement rates or the scope of services being reimbursed could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, any delay or default by the federal or state governments in making Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement payments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect the federal and state governments to continue their efforts to contain growth in Medicaid expenditures, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nMedicaid is our largest source of revenue, accounting for 34.1% of our consolidated revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 31.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. Medicaid is a state-administered program financed by both state funds and matching federal funds. Medicaid spending has increased rapidly in recent years, becoming a significant component of state budgets. This, combined with slower state revenue growth, has led both the federal government and many states (including California and Texas, where significant portions of our Medicaid-related business is located) to\ninstitute measures aimed at controlling the growth of Medicaid spending, and in some instances reducing aggregate Medicaid spending. We expect these state and federal efforts to continue for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, not all of the states in which we operate, most notably Texas, have elected to expand Medicaid as part of federal healthcare reform legislation. Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries in Texas participate in a state inter-governmental payment program that provides supplemental Medicaid payments with federal matching funds for skilled nursing facilities that are affiliated with county owned hospital districts. There can be no assurance that the program, or the Company's participation in it, on the current terms or otherwise, will continue for any particular period of time beyond the foreseeable future. If Medicaid reimbursement rates are reduced or fail to increase as quickly as our costs, or if there are changes in the rules governing the Medicaid program that are disadvantageous to our businesses, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRecent federal government proposals could limit the states' use of provider tax programs to generate revenue for their Medicaid expenditures, which could result in a reduction in our reimbursement rates under Medicaid.\nTo generate funds to pay for the increasing costs of the Medicaid program, many states utilize financial arrangements commonly referred to as \"provider taxes.\" Under provider tax arrangements, states collect taxes from healthcare providers and then use the revenue to pay the providers as a Medicaid expenditure, which allows the states to then claim additional federal matching funds on the additional reimbursements. Current federal law provides for a cap on the maximum allowable provider tax as a percentage of the provider's total revenue. There can be no assurance that federal law will continue to provide matching federal funds on state Medicaid expenditures funded through provider taxes, or that the current caps on provider taxes will not be reduced. Any discontinuance or reduction in federal matching of provider tax-related Medicaid expenditures could have a significant and adverse effect on states' Medicaid expenditures, and as a result could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue we receive from Medicare and Medicaid is subject to potential retroactive reduction.\nPayments we receive from Medicare and Medicaid can be retroactively adjusted after examination during the claims settlement process or as a result of post-payment audits. Payors may disallow our requests for reimbursement, or recoup amounts previously reimbursed, based on determinations by the payors or their third-party audit contractors that certain costs are not reimbursable because either adequate or additional documentation was not provided or because certain services were not covered or deemed to not be medically necessary. Significant adjustments, recoupments or repayments of our Medicare or Medicaid revenue, and the costs associated with complying with investigative audits by regulatory and governmental authorities, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, from time to time we become aware, either based on information provided by third parties and/or the results of internal audits, of payments from payor sources that were either wholly or partially in excess of the amount that we should have been paid for the service provided. Overpayments may result from a variety of factors, including insufficient documentation supporting the services rendered or medical necessity of the services, other failures to document the satisfaction of the necessary conditions of payment, or in some cases for providing services that are deemed to be worthless. We are required by law in most instances to refund the full amount of the overpayment after becoming aware of it, and failure to do so within requisite time limits imposed by the law could lead to significant fines and penalties being imposed on us. Furthermore, our initial billing of and payments for services that are unsupported by the requisite documentation and satisfaction of any other conditions of payment, regardless of our awareness of the failure at the time of the billing or payment, could expose us to significant fines and penalties, including pursuant to the Federal False Claims Act (\"FFCA\") and the Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law (\"FCMPL\"). Violations of the FFCA could lead to any combination of a variety of criminal, civil and administrative fines and penalties. The FFCA provides for civil fines ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 per claim plus treble damages. The Civil Monetary Penalties Law similarly provides for civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 per claim plus up to treble damages. We and/or certain of our operating companies could also be subject to exclusion from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid programs in some circumstances as well, in addition to any monetary or other fines, penalties or sanctions that we may incur under applicable federal and/or state law. Our repayment of any such amounts, as well as any fines, penalties or other sanctions that we may incur, could be significant and could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time we are also involved in various external governmental investigations, audits and reviews. Reviews, audits and investigations of this sort can lead to government actions, which can result in the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs. For example, the Office of the Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d) conducts a variety of routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews across our industry. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, becoming subject to these governmental investigations, audits and reviews can also require us to incur significant legal and document production expenses as we cooperate with the government authorities, regardless of whether the particular investigation, audit or review leads to the identification of underlying issues. For example, as discussed under\n\u201cCreekside Hospice Litigation,\u201d \"Therapy Matters Litigation,\" and \"Staffing Matters Litigation\" in Note 13, \"Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Matters\", included elsewhere in this report, the government has investigated and has elected to intervene in two pending qui tam actions that allege violations of the FFCA and the Nevada False Claims Act in connection with the operations of our affiliated Las Vegas, Nevada hospice, and the government is investigating and has expressed its intent to pursue litigation against us in connection with two other pending investigations. We have accrued $6.0 million as a contingent liability in connection with the Creekside Hospice Litigation based on a prior offer of settlement that we made in the matter, but it could ultimately cost more than that amount to settle or otherwise resolve it, including to satisfy any judgment that might be rendered against us if our litigation defense were ultimately unsuccessful. We do not currently have any contingent liabilities accrued in connection with the other two aforementioned investigations because the standards for accrual have not been satisfied in those matters. However, expenses incurred in resolution of either of those matters, as well as the costs of defense should litigation be instituted, could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition.\nOur success is dependent upon retaining key executive and personnel.\nOur senior management team has extensive experience in the healthcare industry. We believe that they have been instrumental in guiding our businesses, instituting valuable performance and quality monitoring, and driving innovation. Our future performance is substantially dependent upon the continued services of our senior management team or their successors. The loss of the services of any of these persons could have a material adverse effect upon us.\nHealth reform legislation could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition.\nIn recent years, there have been numerous initiatives on the federal and state levels for comprehensive reforms affecting the payment for, the availability of and reimbursement for, healthcare services in the United States. These initiatives have ranged from proposals to fundamentally change federal and state healthcare reimbursement programs, including the provision of comprehensive healthcare coverage to the public under governmental funded programs, to minor modifications to existing programs. PPACA was enacted in 2010 and is among the most comprehensive and notable of these legislative efforts. The impact of PPACA remains uncertain to a large degree due to various implementation, timing, cost and regulatory requirements imposed by the legislation. The content or timing of any future health reform legislation, and its impact on us is impossible to predict. However, it is likely that certain provisions in PPACA will impose significant costs on us or that will otherwise negatively affect our operations. For instance, the requirement to offer full time employees \u201caffordable\u201d healthcare insurance that meets specified coverage minimums (or alternatively pay a per-employee penalty to the federal government) could significantly increase our annual healthcare costs or could damage employee morale and/or cause other employee-related issues that are harmful to our operations. If significant reforms are made to the U.S. healthcare system, those reforms may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we incur considerable administrative costs in monitoring the changes made within the various reimbursement programs in which we participate, determining the appropriate actions to be taken in response to those changes, and implementing the required actions to meet the new requirements and minimize the repercussions of the changes to our organization, reimbursement rates and costs.\nAnnual caps that limit the amounts that can be paid for outpatient therapy services rendered to any Medicare beneficiary may negatively affect our results of operations.\nSome of our rehabilitation therapy revenue is paid by the Medicare Part B program under a fee schedule. There are annual caps that limit, subject to certain exceptions, the amounts that can be paid (including deductible and coinsurance amounts) for rehabilitation therapy services rendered to any Medicare beneficiary under Medicare Part B. There is a combined cap for physical therapy and speech-language pathology and a separate cap for occupational therapy that apply subject to certain exceptions. The discontinuation or change in the current cap exception process or future modifications of the Medicare Part B cap structure could have an adverse effect on the revenue that we generate through our rehabilitation therapy business. This could in turn have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, the Medicare Part B therapy pre-approval provisions (MMR) and multiple procedure payment reduction (\"MPPR\") rate reductions that took effect October 1, 2012, have continued to negatively impact our therapy business.\nThe MMR requirement generally provides that, on a per beneficiary basis and subject to limited exceptions, services above $3,700 for physical therapy and speech-language pathology services combined and/or $3,700 for occupational therapy services are subject to manual medical review (typically on a pre-payment basis) by the applicable Medicare contractors. Challenges in obtaining a timely response from the applicable contractors and other difficulties with the MMR system have added significant uncertainty as to whether beneficiaries will have access to the applicable therapy services that are over the cap amount, and whether the provider will be reimbursed for those services. Under the MPPR policy, when physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech-language pathology services are performed on the same day for the same patient and paid under Medicare Part B, then Medicare effectively makes a full reimbursement payment for only one of the procedures and the\nreimbursements for the other procedures are at a reduced rate. The application of the MPPR policy has negatively affected our therapy business and will continue to do so as long as the policy is in effect.\nWe are subject to a Medicare cap amount for our hospice business. Our net patient service revenue and profitability could be adversely affected by limitations on Medicare payments.\nOverall payments made by Medicare to us on a per hospice basis are subject to an annual cap amount. Total Medicare payments received for services rendered during the applicable Medicare hospice cap year by each of our Medicare-certified hospice programs during this period are compared to the cap amount for the relevant period. Payments in excess of the cap are subject to recoupment by Medicare.\nWe monitor the Medicare cap amount and seek to implement corrective measures as necessary. We maintain what we believe are adequate allowances in the event that our individual hospice agencies exceed the Medicare hospice cap in any given fiscal year. However, many of the variables involved in estimating the Medicare hospice cap contractual adjustment are beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will not increase or decrease our estimated contractual allowance in the future, or that we will not be required to surrender amounts we received from Medicare that were in excess of the Medicare hospice cap for any particular period(s).\nWe recorded net hospice cap reserves of $2.7 million in 2014 and $5.6 million in 2013. This adjustment related primarily to patients staying on service longer than estimated which results in the patients' lifetime cap allowances being stretched over multiple cap years. Our ability to comply with the cap limitation depends on a number of factors relating to a given hospice program, including number of admissions, average length of stay, mix in level of care and Medicare patients that transfer into and out of our hospice programs. Our revenue and profitability may be materially reduced if we are unable to comply with this and other Medicare payment limitations. We cannot assure you that our hospice programs will not exceed the cap amount in the future or that our estimate of the Medicare cap contractual adjustment will not differ materially from the actual Medicare cap amount.\nWe are subject to extensive and complex laws and government regulations. If we are not operating in compliance with these laws and regulations or if these laws and regulations change, we could be required to make significant expenditures or change our operations in order to bring our facilities and operations into compliance.\nWe, along with other companies in the healthcare industry, are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things:\n\u2022\nlicensure and certification;\n\u2022\nadequacy and quality of healthcare services;\n\u2022\nqualifications of healthcare and support personnel;\n\u2022\nquality of medical equipment;\n\u2022\nconfidentiality, maintenance and security issues associated with medical records and claims processing;\n\u2022\nrelationships with physicians and other referral sources and recipients;\n\u2022\nconstraints on protective contractual provisions with patients and third-party payors;\n\u2022\noperating policies and procedures;\n\u2022\naddition of facilities and services; and\n\u2022\nbilling for services.\nMany of these laws and regulations are expansive, and we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations. In addition, many of these laws and regulations evolve to include additional obligations and restrictions, and sometimes with retroactive effect. Certain other regulatory developments, such as revisions in the building code requirements for assisted living and skilled nursing facilities, mandatory increases in scope and quality of care to be offered to residents, revisions in licensing and certification standards, mandatory staffing levels, regulations regarding conditions for payment and regulations restricting those we can hire, could also have a material adverse effect on us. In the future, different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses.\nOne development potentially restricting those we may hire was a decision on November 3, 2010 by the Physical Therapy Board of California (\"PT Board\") to rescind a 1990 PT Board resolution which determined that the offering of physical therapy services by a corporation, not organized as a professional corporation, was permitted by the Physical Therapy Practice Act, which is the California statute governing the provision of physical therapy within the state. This rescission purports to prohibit employment of a physical therapist to provide physical therapy services by any professional corporation except those owned by physical therapists and Naturopaths. Lay corporations that hold themselves out as physical therapy corporations would be similarly prohibited. We have a subsidiary that employs physical therapists in California, but is not owned by physical therapists. Our subsidiary contracts with nursing facilities to provide the facilities with personnel who are licensed to provide\nrehabilitation therapy services, including physical therapy, occupational therapy and/or speech language pathology services. Our therapists then provide rehabilitation therapy services to the nursing facilities' patients under the skilled nursing facilities' licenses that authorize the provision of physical therapy (and other rehabilitation therapy services, if applicable). In this relationship, the nursing facilities retain the patient relationship, remain professionally responsible for the healthcare services including therapy, and bill the patient and/or third party payors for the services rendered to their patients. We are unaware of any enforcement actions by the PT Board to date and it is not clear whether the applicable law would ultimately be interpreted to mean that our rehabilitation therapy subsidiary cannot employ and provide physical therapists to nursing facilities in California as it currently does. Nevertheless, the PT Board could seek an enforcement action against our rehabilitation therapy subsidiary and its physical therapist employees and we may have to significantly restructure our California rehabilitation therapy operations to conform to the PT Board's revised interpretation of the law.\nIn addition, federal and state government agencies have increased and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare companies, including skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies and hospice agencies. This includes investigations of:\n\u2022\nfraud and abuse;\n\u2022\nquality of care;\n\u2022\nfinancial relationships with referral sources; and\n\u2022\nthe medical necessity of services provided.\nWe are unable to predict the future course of federal, state and local regulation or legislation, including Medicare and Medicaid statutes and regulations, the intensity of federal and state enforcement actions or the extent and size of any potential sanctions, fines or penalties. Changes in the regulatory framework, our failure to obtain or renew required regulatory approvals or licenses or to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the suspension or revocation of our licenses or our disqualification from participation in federal and state reimbursement programs, or the imposition of other enforcement sanctions, fines or penalties could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Furthermore, should we lose licenses or certifications for a number of our facilities or other businesses as a result of regulatory action, legal proceedings such as those described in Note 13, \"Commitments and Contingencies-Legal Matters,\" or otherwise, we could be deemed to be in default under some of our agreements, including agreements governing outstanding indebtedness and the report of such issues at one of our facilities could harm our reputation for quality care and lead to a reduction in our patient referrals and ultimately our revenue and operating income.\nWe face inspections, reviews, audits and investigations under federal and state government programs and contracts. These audits could have adverse findings that may negatively affect our business.\nAs a result of our participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, we are subject to various governmental inspections, reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with these programs and applicable laws and regulations. Managed care payors may also reserve the right to conduct audits. We also periodically conduct internal audits and reviews of our regulatory compliance. An adverse inspection, review, audit or investigation could result in:\n\u2022\nrefunding amounts we have been paid pursuant to the Medicare or Medicaid programs or from managed care payors;\n\u2022\nstate or federal agencies imposing fines, penalties and other sanctions on us;\n\u2022\ntemporary suspension of payment for new patients to the facility or agency;\n\u2022\ndecertification or exclusion from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid programs or one or more managed care payor networks;\n\u2022\nself-disclosure of violations to applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation;\n\u2022\nthe revocation of a facility's or agency's license; and\n\u2022\nloss of certain rights under, or termination of, our contracts with managed care payors.\nWe have in the past and will likely in the future be required to refund amounts we have been paid and/or pay fines and penalties, as a result of these inspections, reviews, audits and investigations. If adverse inspections, reviews, audits or investigations occur and any of the results noted above occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Furthermore, the legal, document production and other costs associated with complying with these inspections, reviews, audits or investigations could be significant.\nSignificant legal actions, which are commonplace in our professions, could subject us to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nThe long-term care profession has experienced an increasing trend in the number and severity of litigation claims involving punitive damages and settlements. We believe that this trend is endemic to the industry and is a result of a variety of\nfactors, including the number of large judgments, including large punitive damage awards, against long-term care providers in recent years resulting in an increased awareness by plaintiffs' lawyers of potentially large recoveries. While some states have enacted tort reform legislation that limits plaintiffs' recoveries in some respects, should our professional liability and general liability increase significantly in the future, we may not be able to increase our revenue sufficiently to cover the cost increases, our operating income could suffer, and we may not be able to meet our obligations to repay our liabilities. For a discussion of recent litigation claims against us, including the Humboldt County Action, see Note 13, \"Commitments and Contingencies-Legal Matters\", in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nWe also may be subject to lawsuits under the FFCA and comparable state laws for submitting allegedly fraudulent or otherwise inappropriate bills for services to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These lawsuits, which may be initiated by regulatory authorities as well as private party relators, can involve significant monetary damages, fines, attorney fees and the award of bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits, as well as to the government programs. In recent years, government oversight and law enforcement have become increasingly active and aggressive in investigating and taking legal action against potential fraud and abuse.\nWe may incur significant liabilities in conjunction with legal actions against us, including as a result of damages, fines and penalties that may be assessed against us, as well as a result of the sometimes significant commitments of financial and management resources that are often required to defend against such legal actions. The incurrence of such liabilities and related commitments of resources could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could face significant financial difficulties as a result of one or more of the risks discussed in this report, which could cause us to significantly alter our business and/or seek protection under bankruptcy laws or could cause our creditors or government authorities to have a receiver appointed on our behalf.\nWe could face significant financial difficulties if Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement rates are reduced, patient demand for our services is reduced or we incur unexpected liabilities or expenses, including in connection with legal actions, sanctions, penalties or fines or the other risks discussed in this report. This financial difficulty could cause us to significantly alter our business and/or seek protection under bankruptcy laws or could cause our creditors or government authorities to have a receiver appointed on our behalf.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis.\nWe produce our consolidated financial statements in accordance with the requirements of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, to help mitigate the risk of fraud and to operate successfully. We are required by federal securities laws to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nTesting and maintaining our internal control over financial reporting can be expensive and divert our management's attention from other matters that are important to our business. We may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with applicable law, or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able or willing to issue an unqualified attestation report if we conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified attestation report on our internal control, we could be required to take costly and time-consuming corrective measures, be required to restate the affected historical financial statements, be subjected to investigations and/or sanctions by federal and state securities regulators, and be subjected to civil lawsuits by security holders. Any of the foregoing could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and in our company and would likely result in a decline in the market price of our stock and in our ability to raise additional financing if needed in the future. Also, as a result of the Combination with FC-GEN that closed on February 2, 2015, we are evaluating our internal control policies and procedures and may make modifications to the design of our internal control policies and procedures.\nChanges in the acuity mix of patients as well as payor mix and payment methodologies may significantly reduce our profitability or cause us to incur losses.\nOur revenue is affected by our ability to attract a favorable patient acuity mix, and by our mix of payment sources. Changes in the type of patients we attract, as well as our payor mix among private payors, managed care companies, Medicare (both traditional Medicare and \"managed\" Medicare/Medicare Advantage) and Medicaid, significantly affect our profitability because not all payors reimburse us at the same rates. Particularly, if we fail to maintain our proportion of high-acuity patients or if there is any significant increase in the percentage of our population for which we receive Medicaid reimbursement, our financial position, results of operations and cash flow may be adversely affected. Furthermore, in recent periods we have continued to see a shift from to \u201ctraditional\u201d fee-for-service Medicare patients to \u201cmanaged\u201d Medicare (Medicare Advantage) patients. Reimbursement rates are generally lower for services provided to Medicare Advantage patients than they are for the same services provided to traditional fee-for-service Medicare patients. This trend may continue in future periods. Our financial results have been negatively affected by this shift to date. Our financial results will continue to be negatively affected if the trend towards Medicare Advantage continues, and particularly if it accelerates.\nIt can be difficult to attract and retain qualified nurses, therapists, healthcare professionals and other key personnel, which can increase our costs related to these employees\nOur employees are our most important asset. We rely on our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses, therapists and other healthcare professionals. The market for these key personnel is highly competitive, and we could experience significant increases in our operating costs due to shortages in their availability. Like other healthcare providers, we have at times experienced difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, especially facility administrators, nurses, therapists, certified nurses' aides and other important healthcare personnel. We may continue to experience increases in our labor costs, primarily due to higher wages and greater benefits required to attract and retain qualified healthcare personnel, and such increases may adversely affect our profitability. Furthermore, while we attempt to manage overall labor costs in the most efficient way, our efforts to manage them through wage freezes and similar means may have limited effectiveness and may lead to increased turnover and other challenges.\nTight labor markets and high demand for such employees can contribute to high turnover among clinical professional staff. A shortage of qualified personnel at a facility could result in significant increases in labor costs and increased reliance on overtime and expensive temporary staffing agencies, and could otherwise adversely affect operations at the affected facilities. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified professionals, our ability to adequately provide services to our residents and patients may decline and our ability to grow may be constrained.\nIf we are unable to comply with state minimum staffing requirements at one or more of our facilities, we could be subject to fines or other sanctions.\nIncreased attention to the quality of care provided in skilled nursing facilities has caused several states to mandate, and other states to consider mandating, staffing laws that require minimum nursing hours of direct care per resident per day. These minimum staffing requirements further increase the gap between demand for and supply of qualified professionals, and lead to higher labor costs.\nWe operate a number of facilities in California, which enacted legislation aimed at establishing minimum staffing requirements for facilities operating in that state. This legislation required that the California Department of Public Health (\"DPH\"), promulgate regulations requiring each skilled nursing facility to provide a minimum of 3.2 nursing hours per patient day. The DPH finalized regulations in 2009 that required three 8-hour shifts for nurse-to-patient staffing, described documentation and notice requirements, and specified procedures for obtaining a waiver from per-shift staffing requirements at skilled nursing facilities. Although DPH finalized the regulations, initial implementation of the statute authorizing the regulations is contingent on an appropriation in the state's annual budged legislation or another statute. Because no appropriation was made and no additional statutes were enacted, the regulations did not become operational. Therefore, DPH will continue its practice of determining a facility's compliance with the 3.2 hour of nursing services per patient day measure in accordance with its internal policy and through on-site reviews conducted during periodic licensing and certification surveys and in response to complaints. If the DPH determines that a facility is out of compliance with this staffing measure, the DPH may issue a notice of deficiency, or a citation, depending on the impact on patient care. A citation carries with it the imposition of significant monetary fines. DPH has issued guidelines, implementing the provisions of newly enacted California laws, for state audits that verify compliance with the 3.2 nursing hours per patient day staffing requirements. If DPH determines under an audit that a facility has failed to meet the minimum staffing requirement for between 5% and 49% of the audited days, a significant administrative monetary penalty will be assessed. If DPH determines that a facility has failed to meet the minimum staffing requirement for more than 49% of the audited days, then a larger administrative monetary penalty will be assessed. The issuance of either a notice of deficiency or a citation requires the facility to prepare and implement an acceptable plan of correction. The Humboldt County Action included allegations that certain of our California skilled nursing facilities failed to meet state-mandated minimum staffing requirements. The Humboldt County Action, which occurred prior to DPH's adoption of the aforementioned guidelines, resulted in a jury verdict against us and certain of our affiliated skilled nursing companies that awarded $677 million in damages. The case was ultimately settled in September 2010, pursuant to which we were required to deposit into escrow a total of $50 million to cover certain settlement costs. For more information regarding the Humboldt\nCounty Action and the settlement, as well as a description of our February 2013 settlement with the BMFEA which included a new staffing agreement and of an investigation by the DOJ regarding related staffing considerations, see Note 13, \"Commitments and Contingencies-Legal Matters,\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nOur ability to satisfy any minimum staffing requirements depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified healthcare professionals, including nurses, certified nurse's assistants and other personnel. Attracting and retaining this personnel is difficult, given a tight labor market for these professionals in many of the markets in which we operate. Furthermore, if states do not appropriate additional funds (through Medicaid program appropriations or otherwise) sufficient to pay for any additional operating costs resulting from minimum staffing requirements, our profitability may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to attract patients and residents and to compete effectively with other healthcare providers, our revenue and profitability may decline and we may incur losses.\nThe healthcare services industry is highly competitive. Our skilled nursing facilities compete primarily on a local and regional basis with many long-term care providers, from national and regional chains to smaller providers owning as few as a single nursing center. We also compete under certain circumstances with inpatient rehabilitation facilities and long-term acute care hospitals. Our hospices and home health agencies also compete with local, regional and national companies. We anticipate additional competition in the future from accountable care organizations, as well as HMO's and similar healthcare systems that seek to provide a wider variety of healthcare services to their patients/members. Increased competition could limit our ability to attract and retain patients, maintain or increase rates and occupancy, or to expand our business. Our ability to compete successfully varies from location to location and depends on a number of factors, including the number of competitors in the local market, the types of services available, our local reputation for quality care of patients, achieve or maintain desired census levels, the commitment and expertise of our staff and physicians, our local service offerings and treatment programs, the cost of care in each locality, and the physical appearance, location, age and condition of our facilities. If we are unable to attract patients to our facilities and agencies, particularly high-acuity patients, then our revenue and profitability will be adversely affected. Some of our competitors may have greater recognition and be more established in their respective communities than we are, and may have greater financial and other resources than we have. Competing long-term care companies may also offer newer facilities or different programs or services than we do, which, combined with the foregoing factors, may result in our competitors being more attractive to our current patients, to potential patients and to referral sources. Furthermore, while we budget for routine capital expenditures at our facilities to keep them competitive in their respective markets, to the extent that competitive forces cause those expenditures to increase in the future our financial condition may be negatively affected.\nSome of our competitors may accept lower profit margins than we do, which could present significant price competition, particularly for managed care and private pay patients. We believe we utilize a conservative approach in complying with laws prohibiting kickbacks and referral payments to referral sources. However, some of our competitors may use more aggressive methods than we do with this respect to obtaining patient referrals, and as a result competitors may from time to time obtain patient referrals that are not otherwise available to us.\nThe primary competitive factors for our assisted living, rehabilitation therapy, hospice and home health care services are similar to those for our skilled nursing businesses and include reputation, the cost of services, the quality of services, responsiveness to patient/resident needs and the ability to provide support in other areas such as third-party reimbursement, information management and patient recordkeeping. Furthermore, given the relatively low barriers to entry and continuing healthcare cost containment pressures, we expect that the markets we service will become increasingly competitive in the future. Increased competition in the future could limit our ability to attract and retain patients and residents, maintain or increase our fees, or expand our business.\nInsurance coverage may become increasingly expensive and difficult to obtain for health care companies, and our self-insurance may expose us to significant losses.\nIt may become more difficult and costly for us to obtain coverage for patient care liabilities and certain other risks, including property and casualty insurance. Insurance carriers may require health care companies to significantly increase their self-insured retention levels and/or pay substantially higher premiums for reduced coverage for most insurance coverages, including workers' compensation, employee healthcare and patient care liability.\nWe self-insure a significant portion of our potential liabilities for several risks, including certain types of professional and general liability, workers' compensation and employee healthcare benefits. Due to our self-insured retentions under many of our professional and general liability, workers' compensation and employee healthcare benefits programs, including our election to self-insure against workers' compensation claims in Texas, there is no limit on the maximum number of claims or amount for which we can be liable in any policy period. We base our loss estimates and related accruals on actuarial analyses, which determine expected liabilities on an undiscounted basis, including incurred but not reported losses, based upon the available information on a given date. It is possible, however, for the ultimate amount of losses to exceed our estimates and related accruals, as well as our insurance limits as applicable. In the event our actual liability exceeds our estimates for any given period, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted. Additionally, we may from time to time need to increase our accruals as a result of future actuarial reviews and claims that may develop. Such increases could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. An adverse determination in legal proceedings, whether currently asserted or arising in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf our referral sources fail to view us as an attractive health care provider, our patient base would likely decrease.\nWe rely significantly on appropriate referrals from physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers in the communities in which we deliver our services to attract the kinds of patients we target. Our referral sources are not obligated to refer business to us and generally also refer business to other healthcare providers. We believe many of our referral sources refer business to us as a result of the quality of our patient service and our efforts to establish and build a relationship with them. If we lose, or fail to maintain, existing relationships with our referral resources, fail to develop new relationships or if we are perceived by our referral sources for any reason as not providing high quality patient care, our volume of referrals would likely decrease, the quality of our patient mix could suffer and our revenue and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not achieve or maintain a reputation for providing high quality of care, our business may be negatively affected.\nOur ability to achieve and maintain a reputation for providing high quality of care to our patients at each of our skilled nursing and assisted living facilities, or through our rehabilitation therapy, hospice and home health businesses, is important to our ability to attract and retain patients, particularly high-acuity patients. In some instances, our referral sources are affiliated with health care systems that may have affiliated businesses that offer services that compete with ours, and the frequency of this occurring may increase in the future as accountable care organizations are formed in the markets we serve. We believe that the perception of our quality of care by a potential patient or potential patient's family seeking to contract for our services is influenced by a variety of factors, including doctor and other healthcare professional referrals, community information and referral services, newspapers and other print and electronic media, results of patient surveys, recommendations from family and friends, and quality care statistics or rating systems compiled and published by CMS or other industry data. Through our focus on retaining high quality staffing, reviewing feedback and surveys from our patients and referral sources to highlight areas of improvement and integrating our service offerings at each of our facilities, we seek to maintain and improve on the outcomes from each of the factors listed above in order to build and maintain a strong reputation at our facilities. If any of our companies fail to achieve or maintain a reputation for providing high-quality care, or is perceived to provide a lower quality of care than competitors within the same geographic area, our ability to attract and retain patients would be adversely affected. If our businesses fail to maintain a strong reputation in the areas in which we operate, our business, revenue and profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to reduce costs to offset decreases in our patient census levels or other expenses completely.\nWe depend on implementing adequate cost management initiatives in response to fluctuations in levels of patient census in our businesses in order to maintain our current cash flow and earnings levels. Fluctuation in our patient census levels may become more common as we continue our emphasis in our skilled nursing facilities on patients with shorter stays but higher acuities. A decline in patient census levels would likely result in decreased revenue. If we are unable to put in place corresponding reductions in costs in response to decreases in our patient census or other revenue shortfalls, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. There are limits in our ability to reduce the costs of our centers because we must maintain staffing levels.\nWe may not be fully reimbursed for all services that our skilled nursing facilities are able to bill through Medicare's consolidated billing requirements.\nSkilled nursing facilities are required to bill Medicare on a consolidated basis for certain items and services that they furnish to patients and residents, regardless of the amount or costs of services that the patients and residents actually receive. The consolidated billing requirement essentially confers on the skilled nursing facility itself the Medicare billing responsibility for the entire package of care that its residents receive in these situations. Federal law also requires that post-hospitalization skilled nursing services be \u201cbundled\u201d into the hospital's Diagnostic Related Group (\"DRG\") payment in certain circumstances. Where this rule applies, the hospital and the skilled nursing facility must, in effect, divide the payment which otherwise would\nhave been paid to the hospital alone for the patient's treatment, and no additional funds are paid by Medicare for skilled nursing care of the patient. This requirement may, in instances where it is applicable, have a negative effect on skilled nursing facility utilization/census and payments, either because hospitals may find it difficult to place patients in skilled nursing facilities which will not be paid as they previously were, or because hospitals are reluctant to discharge patients to skilled nursing facilities and lose a portion of the payment that the hospital would otherwise receive. This bundling requirement could be extended to more DRGs in the future, which could exacerbate the potentially negative impact on skilled nursing facility utilization/census and payments. As a result of the bundling requirements we may not be fully reimbursed for all services that a facility bills through consolidated billing, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nConsolidation of managed care organizations and other third-party payors or reductions in reimbursement from these payors may adversely affect our revenue and income or cause us to incur losses.\nManaged care organizations and other third-party payors have in many instances consolidated in order to enhance their ability to influence the delivery of healthcare services. Consequently, the healthcare needs of a large percentage of the United States population are increasingly served by a small number of managed care organizations. These organizations generally enter into service agreements with a limited number of providers for needed services. These organizations have become an increasingly important source of revenue and referrals for us. To the extent that such organizations terminate us as a preferred provider or engage our competitors as a preferred or exclusive provider, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, private third-party payors, including managed care payors, are continuing their efforts to control healthcare costs through direct contracts with healthcare providers, increased utilization reviews, or reviews of the propriety of, and charges for, services provided, and greater enrollment in managed care programs and preferred provider organizations. As these private payors increase their purchasing power, they are demanding discounted fee structures and the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk associated with the provision of care. Significant reductions in reimbursement from these sources could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nDelays in reimbursement may cause liquidity problems.\nIf we have information systems problems or payment or other issues arise with Medicare, Medicaid or other payors that affect the amount or timeliness of reimbursements, we may encounter delays in our payment cycle. Any significant payment timing delay could cause us to experience working capital shortages. As a result, working capital management, including prompt and diligent billing and collection, is an important factor in our consolidated results of operations and liquidity. Our working capital management procedures may not successfully mitigate the effects of any delays in our receipt of payments or reimbursements. Accordingly, such delays could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nOur rehabilitation and other related healthcare services are also subject to delays in reimbursement, as we act as vendors to other providers who in turn must wait for reimbursement from other third-party payors. Each of these customers is therefore subject to the same potential delays to which our nursing homes are subject, meaning any such delays would further delay the date we would receive payment for the provision of our related healthcare services. To the extent we grow and expand the rehabilitation and other complementary services that we offer to third parties, we may incur increasing delays in payment for these services, and these payment delays could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. We may also experience delays in reimbursement related to change of ownership applications for our acquired facilities, as well as changes in fiscal intermediaries.\nFuture acquisitions may use significant resources, may be unsuccessful and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities.\nWe intend to selectively pursue acquisitions and development of skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, contract rehabilitation therapy businesses, and other related healthcare operations. Acquisitions may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, operating losses and additional expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating acquired operations, personnel and accounting and information systems, or in realizing projected efficiencies and cost savings;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees or customers of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nentry into markets in which we may have limited or no experience;\n\u2022\nincreasing our indebtedness and limiting our ability to access additional capital when needed;\n\u2022\nassumption of unknown liabilities or regulatory issues of acquired companies, including failure to comply with healthcare regulations or to establish internal financial controls; and\n\u2022\nstraining of our resources, including internal controls relating to information and accounting systems, regulatory compliance, logistics and others.\nFurthermore, certain of the foregoing risks could be exacerbated when combined with other growth measures that we may pursue.\nWe lease a significant number of our facilities and may experience risks relating to lease termination, lease extensions and special charges.\nFollowing the Combination with FC-GEN, Genesis Healthcare, Inc. faces risks because of the number of facilities we lease. As of February 2, 2015, we leased approximately 80% of our centers and 40% of those centers were leased from Health Care REIT, Inc. (\u201cHCN\u201d) and an additional 36% were leased pursuant to master lease agreements with other landlords. The loss or deterioration of our relationship with HCN may adversely affect our business.\nEach of our lease agreements provide that the lessor may terminate the lease, subject to applicable cure provisions, for a number of reasons, including, the defaults in any payment of rent, taxes or other payment obligations or the breach of any other covenant or agreement in the lease. Termination of certain of our lease agreements could result in a cross-default under our debt agreements or other lease agreements.\nOur leases generally provide for renewal or extension options. We expect to renew or extend our leases in the normal course of business; however, there can be no assurance that these rights will be exercised in the future or that we will be able to satisfy the conditions precedent to exercising any such renewal or extension. In addition, if we are unable to renew or extend any of our master leases, we may lose all of the facilities subject to that master lease agreement. If we are not able to renew or extend our leases at or prior to the end of the existing lease terms, or if the terms of such options are unfavorable or unacceptable to us, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.\nOur high percentage of facilities leased pursuant to master lease agreements limits our ability to exit markets. As a result, if some facilities should prove to be unprofitable, we may remain obligated for lease payments even if we decide to withdraw from those locations. We could incur special charges relating to the closing of such facilities, including lease termination costs, impairment charges and other special charges that would reduce our profits and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nGlobal economic conditions may impact our ability to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all and our ability to expand our business may be harmed.\nGlobal market and economic conditions in recent years have been very challenging with tight credit conditions and slow or negative economic growth in most major economies generally expected to continue in 2015 and possibly beyond. Ongoing concerns about the systemic impact of potential long-term and widespread economic recession or stagnation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, sovereign debt issues, the availability and cost of credit, and the global real estate and mortgage markets have contributed to increased market volatility, uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. These conditions, combined with volatile prices for energy, food and other commodities, unstable business and consumer confidence, and significant unemployment, have contributed to pronounced economic volatility.\nAs a result of these market conditions, the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets, interest rate fluctuations and wider credit spreads. Concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers. These factors have led to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike, and a corresponding decrease in global infrastructure spending. Turbulence in the U.S. and international markets and economies and declines or stagnation in business and consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers, including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs.\nIf our ability to borrow under our credit facilities is insufficient for our capital requirements, we will be required to seek additional sources of financing, including issuing equity, which may be dilutive to our current stockholders or incurring additional debt. Our ability to incur additional debt is subject to the restrictions in our credit facilities. There can be no assurance that the restrictions contained in our credit facilities will permit us to borrow the funds that we need to finance our operations, or that additional debt will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Furthermore, market conditions may impede our ability to secure additional sources of financing, whether through the extension of our existing credit facilities or by accessing the debt and/or equity markets. If we are unable to obtain funds sufficient to finance our capital requirements, we may have to forego opportunities to expand our business, including the acquisition or development of additional or expanded facilities.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations.\nWe have now and will for the foreseeable future continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness, both before and after the Combination with FC-GEN. At December 31, 2014, our total indebtedness was approximately $410.8 million.\nFollowing the Combination with FC-GEN, our total funded indebtedness is approximately $970.0 million. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nincrease the cost or limit the availability of additional financing, if needed or desired, to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements, or to carry out other aspects of our business plan;\n\u2022\nrequire us to maintain debt coverage and financial ratios at specified levels, reducing our financial flexibility; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to make strategic acquisitions and develop new or expanded facilities.\nIn addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required debt payments, or if we fail to comply with the various covenants and requirements of our credit facilities or other existing or future indebtedness, we would be in default, which could permit the holders of our indebtedness, including our credit facilities, to accelerate the maturity of indebtedness, as the case may be. Any default under our credit facilities, or our other existing or future indebtedness, as well as any of the above-listed factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition.\nDespite our substantial indebtedness, we may still be able to incur more debt. This could intensify the risks associated with this indebtedness.\nThe terms of our credit facilities contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness. These restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these exceptions could be substantial. Accordingly, we could incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. The more we become leveraged, the more we become exposed to the risks described above under \u201cOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations.\u201d\nFloating rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase.\nFollowing the Combination with FC-GEN, we will have significant indebtedness in multiple instruments that bear interest at variable rates. Interest rate changes could affect the amount of our interest payments, and accordingly, our future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. As a result, an increase in interest rates, whether because of an increase in market interest rates or an increase in our own cost of borrowing, would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could materially reduce our profitability. See Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for a description of the types and level of indebtedness following the Combination.\nOur operations are subject to environmental and occupational health and safety regulations, which could subject us to fines, penalties and increased operational costs.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. Regulatory requirements faced by healthcare providers such as us include those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges, air and water quality control, occupational health and safety (such as standards regarding blood-borne pathogens and ergonomics), management and disposal of low-level radioactive medical waste, biohazards and other wastes, management of explosive or combustible gases, such as oxygen, specific regulatory requirements applicable to asbestos, lead-based paints, polychlorinated biphenyls and mold, other occupational hazards associated with our workplaces, and providing notice to employees and members of the public about our use and storage of regulated or hazardous materials and wastes. Failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to fines, penalties and increased operational costs. Moreover, changes in existing requirements or more stringent enforcement of them, as well as discovery of currently unknown conditions at our owned or leased facilities, could result in additional cost and potential liabilities, including liability for conducting cleanup, and there can be no guarantee that such increased expenditures would not be significant.\nA portion of our workforce is unionized and our operations may be adversely affected by work stoppages, strikes or other collective actions.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately 531 of our 13,025 active employees were represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements. Following the Combination, approximately 8,900 of the combined workforce of approximately 95,000 will be represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements. In addition, certain labor unions have publicly stated that they are concentrating their organizing efforts within the long-term healthcare industry.\nWe cannot predict the effect that continued union representation or future organizational activities will have on our business or future operations. There can be no assurance that we will not experience a material work stoppage in the future.\nDisasters and similar events may seriously harm our business.\nNatural and man-made disasters and similar events, including terrorist attacks and acts of nature such as hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, floods and wildfires, may cause damage or disruption to us, our employees and our facilities, which could have an adverse impact on our patients and our business. In order to provide care for our patients, we are dependent on consistent and reliable delivery of food, pharmaceuticals, utilities and other goods to our facilities, and the availability of employees to provide services at our facilities and other locations. If the delivery of goods or the ability of employees to reach our facilities and patients were interrupted in any material respect due to a natural disaster or other reasons, it would have a significant impact on our business. For example, in connection with Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, several nursing home operators unaffiliated with us were accused of not properly caring for their residents, which resulted in, among other things, criminal charges being filed against the proprietors of those facilities. Furthermore, the impact, or impending threat, of a natural disaster has in the past and may in the future require that we evacuate one or more facilities, which would be costly and would involve risks, including potentially fatal risks, for the patients and employees. The impact of disasters and similar events is inherently uncertain. Such events could harm our patients and employees, severely damage or destroy one or more of our facilities, harm our business, reputation and financial performance, or otherwise cause our business to suffer in ways that we currently cannot predict.\nThe operation of our business is dependent on effective and secure information systems.\nWe depend on several information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our business. The software programs supporting these systems are licensed to us by independent software developers. Our inability or the inability of these developers, to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. In addition, costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. Furthermore, while we budget for changes and upgrades to our information technology systems that we anticipate needing over time, it is possible that we may underestimate the actual costs of those changes and upgrades. Failure to make necessary changes and upgrades due to financial or other concerns could negatively impact the effectiveness of our information technology systems, as well as our operations and financial performance.\nAdditionally, we maintain information necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our patients, employees and others with whom we do business, in digital form. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of tampering, theft and unauthorized access. We develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring, but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of tampering, theft and other unauthorized access cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with each of these remain. If our information technology systems are compromised and personal or other protected information regarding patients, employees or others with whom we do business is stolen, tampered with or otherwise improperly accessed, our ability to conduct our business and our reputation may be impaired. If personal or other protected information of our patients, employees or others with whom we do business is tampered with, stolen or otherwise improperly accessed, and we may incur significant costs to remediate possible injury to the affected persons, compensate the affected persons, pay any applicable fines, or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of the incident, including under HIPAA or the HITECH Act, as applicable.\nFollowing the Combination, we may not be able to successfully integrate our operations with FC-GEN's, which could adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock.\nWe cannot be certain whether, and to what extent, any strategic, operational, financial or other anticipated benefits of the Combination with FC-GEN will be achieved. Even if achieved, such benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization. The success of the Combination will depend, in part, on achieving efficiencies and cost savings, and no assurances can be given that such efficiencies and savings will result following the Combination. Integration may be complex and may cause disruptions in the business of the combined company. Failure to integrate quickly and effectively may negatively impact our earnings.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the Combination if the integration is unsuccessful, delayed or inconsistent with the expectations of financial analysts or investors.\nWe have incurred substantial costs and expect to incur additional transaction and integration costs in connection with the Combination.\nWe have incurred significant transaction costs in connection with the Combination with FC-GEN and expect to incur additional costs in connection with the integration of the combined company. Although we expect to achieve strategic, operational and\nfinancial benefits as a result of the Combination, such benefits may be offset by the costs of integration or otherwise not be realized in the near term, or at all.\nWe may not be able to retain key employees following the acquisition, and such inability to retain employees could adversely affect our business.\nThe success of the combined company following the Combination with FC-GEN will depend in part on the ability to retain key employees who are expected to continue employment. If key employees decide not to remain with the combined company, it is possible we may be unable to secure employment of suitable replacements on reasonable terms. In addition, if key employees terminate their employment, the attention of management of the combined company might be diverted from the efforts to successfully integrate our and FC-GEN's operations to hiring suitable replacements.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe holders of a majority of the voting power of Genesis\u2019 common stock have entered into a voting agreement, and the voting group\u2019s interests may conflict with yours.\nThe holders of a majority of the voting power of Genesis\u2019 common stock have entered into a voting agreement governing the election of our directors following the Combination. These holders constitute a \u201cgroup\u201d (as such term is defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) controlling a majority of the voting power of Genesis\u2019s common stock (the \u201cVoting Group\u201d), and we therefore remain a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d following the Combination. Our Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock each have one vote per share. As of February 2, 2015, the Voting Group owned shares of common stock representing over 63% of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, the Voting Group will generally have the power to control the outcome of matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote. Such matters include the election and removal of directors, the adoption or amendment of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, possible mergers, corporate control contests and significant transactions. Through its control of elections to our board of directors, the Voting Group may also have the ability to appoint or replace our senior management and cause us to issue additional shares of our common stock or repurchase common stock, declare dividends or take other actions. The Voting Group may make decisions regarding our company and business that are opposed to our other stockholders\u2019 interests or with which they disagree. The Voting Group may also delay or prevent a change of control of us, even if the change of control would benefit our other stockholders, which could deprive our other stockholders of the opportunity to receive a premium for their Class A common stock. The significant concentration of stock ownership and voting power may also adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise. To the extent that the interests of our public stockholders are harmed by the actions of the Voting Group, the price of our Class A common stock may be harmed.\nSome of our directors are significant stockholders or representatives of significant stockholders, which may result in the diversion of corporate opportunities and other potential conflicts.\nOur board of directors includes certain of our significant stockholders and representatives of certain of our significant stockholders. Those stockholders and their affiliates may invest in entities that directly or indirectly compete with us, companies with which we transact business, or companies in which they are currently invested or in which they serve as an officer or director may already compete with us. As a result of these relationships, when conflicts between the interests of those stockholders or their affiliates and the interests of our other stockholders arise, these directors may not be disinterested.\nAlso, in accordance with Delaware law, our board of directors adopted resolutions to specify the obligation of certain of our directors to present certain corporate opportunities to the Company. While such directors are required to present to us any corporate opportunities in our core businesses (as they may be expanded by our board of directors) and any other opportunity that is expressly offered as an opportunity for the Company, the resolutions also renounce our rights to certain other business opportunities. The resolutions further provide that such directors will not be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity (other than certain types of opportunities set forth in the resolutions) to any person instead of the Company or is engaged in certain current business activities, or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunities to the Company. Accordingly, we may not be presented with certain corporate opportunities that we may find attractive and may wish to pursue.\nIf our stock price is volatile, purchasers of our Class A common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. The stock market in general often experiences substantial volatility that is seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock. The price for our Class A common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe depth and liquidity of the market for our Class A common stock;\n\u2022\ndevelopments generally affecting the healthcare industry;\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions of us and our business;\n\u2022\nactions by institutional or other large stockholders;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions, such as acquisitions or restructurings, or the introduction of new services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nlitigation and governmental investigations;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nadverse conditions in the financial markets, state and federal government or general economic conditions, including those resulting from statewide, national or global financial and deficit considerations, overall market conditions, war, incidents of terrorism and responses to such events;\n\u2022\nsales of Class B common stock by Onex,\n\u2022\nsales of OP units by the Voting Group or members of our management team;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u2022\nour results of operations, financial performance and future prospects.\nThese and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our Class A common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of Class A common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our Class A common stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending or settling the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock is significantly influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our available cash, if any, for use as working capital and for other general purposes, including to service or repay our debt and to fund the operation and expansion of our business. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NYSE rules and, as a result, qualify for and rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nCertain of our stockholders who are parties to a voting agreement control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Under the NYSE rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by another person or group of persons acting together is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain NYSE corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that:\n\u2022\na majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe nominating and corporate governance committee be entirely composed of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities;\n\u2022\nthe compensation committee be entirely composed of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022\nthere be an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.\nWe elect to be treated as a controlled company and thus utilize some of these exemptions. In addition, although we currently have a board composed of a majority of independent directors and have adopted charters for our audit, corporate governance, quality and compliance and compensation committees, and intend to conduct annual performance evaluations for these committees, none of these committees are composed of independent directors, except for our audit committee. Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of NYSE corporate governance requirements.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage transactions resulting in a change in control, which may negatively affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition to the effect that the concentration of ownership and voting power in our significant stockholders may have, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may enable our management to resist a change in control. These provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a change in the ownership of our company or a change in our management, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, these provisions could limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Class A common stock. The provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws include:\n\u2022\nour board of directors is authorized, without prior stockholder approval, to create and issue preferred stock, commonly referred to as \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, with rights senior to those of our Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholders to nominate individuals to serve on our board of directors or to submit proposals that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nour board of directors is classified so not all of the members of our board of directors are elected at one time, which may make it more difficult for a person who acquires control of a majority of our outstanding voting stock to replace our directors;\n\u2022\nspecial meetings of the stockholders are permitted to be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, our chief executive officer,by a majority of our board of directors or by a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote in connection with the election of directors of Genesis;\n\u2022\nstockholders are not permitted to cumulate their votes for the election of directors;\n\u2022\nnewly created directorships resulting from an increase in the authorized number of directors or vacancies on our board of directors will be filled only by majority vote of the remaining directors;\n\u2022\na majority of our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nthe affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the combined voting power of the shares entitled to vote in connection with the election of directors of Skilled Healthcare is required to amend, alter, change, or repeal, or to adopt any provision inconsistent with the purpose and intent of certain articles of the Restated Charter relating to the management of Genesis\u2019 business and conduct of the affairs; the rights to call special meetings of the stockholders; the ability to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting of stockholders; the obligations of Genesis to indemnify its directors and officers; amendments to the bylaws; and amendments to the certificate of incorporation.\nWe are also subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our amended and rested certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law could discourage acquisition proposals and make it more difficult or expensive for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current board of directors, including delaying or impeding a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure\nWe will be required to pay the other members of FC-GEN for certain tax benefits we may claim as a result of the tax basis step-up we receive in connection with exchanges of the members of FC-GEN for Genesis shares. In certain circumstances, payments under the tax receivable agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual tax benefits we realize.\nFC-GEN Class A Common Units may be exchanged for shares of Class A common stock. Such exchanges of Class A Common Units in FC-GEN may result in increases in the tax basis of the assets of FC-GEN that otherwise would not have been available. Such increases in tax basis are likely to increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions and therefore reduce the amount of income tax we would otherwise be required to pay in the future. These increases in tax basis may also decrease gain (or increase loss) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent the increased tax basis is allocated to those capital assets.\nOn February 2, 2015 we entered into a tax receivable agreement (\"the TRA\") with the members of FC-GEN that provides for the payment by us to such members of FC-GEN of 90% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize as a result of (a) the increases in tax basis attributable to the members of FC-GEN and (b) tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed to be paid by us as a result of this TRA. While the actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the TRA, will vary depending upon a number of factors, the payments that we may make to the members of FC-GEN could be substantial.\nAlthough we are not aware of any issue that would cause the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) to challenge a tax basis increase, the IRS may challenge all or part of these tax basis increases, and a court could sustain such a challenge. In\nsuch event, the FC-GEN members generally will not reimburse us for any payments that may previously have been made to them under the TRA. As a result, in certain circumstances we could make payments to the FC-GEN members under the TRA in excess of our cash tax savings.\nIn addition, the TRA provides that, upon a merger, asset sale or other form of business combination or certain other changes of control or if, at any time, we elect an early termination of the TRA, our (or our successor's) obligations with respect to exchanged or acquired Class A Common Units (whether exchanged or acquired before or after such change of control or early termination) would be based on certain assumptions, including that (i) in a case of an early termination, we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the TRA; (ii) in the case of a change of control, we would have taxable income at least equal to our taxable income for the 12-month period ending on the last day of the month immediately preceding the change of control; and (iii) any Class A Common Units that have not been exchanged will be deemed exchanged for the market value of the Class A common stock at the time of early termination or change of control. Consequently, it is possible, in these circumstances also, that the actual cash tax savings realized by us may be significantly less than the corresponding TRA payments.\nIf Genesis were deemed an \"investment company\" under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a result of its ownership of FC-GEN, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nIf Genesis were to cease participation in the management of FC-GEN, its interests in FC-GEN could be deemed an \"investment security\" for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \"1940 Act\"). Generally, a person is deemed to be an \"investment company\" if it owns investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items), absent an applicable exemption. Genesis has substantially no assets other than its equity interests in the managing member of FC-GEN and FC-GEN\u2019s interests in its subsidiaries. A determination that this interest in FC-GEN was an investment security could result in Genesis being an investment company under the 1940 Act and becoming subject to the registration and other requirements of the 1940 Act. We intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. However, if we were to be deemed an investment company, restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and the price of our Class A common stock.", "PERMNO": 92020, "SIC": 8051, "TIC": "GEN"}
