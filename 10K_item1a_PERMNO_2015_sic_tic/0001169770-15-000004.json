Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities is subject to certain risks. These risk factors should be considered by prospective and current investors in our securities when evaluating the disclosures in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer. In that event, the value of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Recently Completed Branch Acquisition from Banco Popular North America\nThe success of our recently completed acquisition of branches from Banco Popular North America will depend on a number of uncertain factors.\nThe success of our recently completed acquisition of branches (the BPNA Branch Acquisition) from Banco Popular North America (BPNA) will depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully integrate the BPNA branches into our current operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to limit outflow of deposits held by our new customers in the BPNA branches and to retain interest-earning assets (i.e., loans) acquired in the BPNA Branch Acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe credit quality of loans acquired as part of the BPNA Branch Acquisition;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new deposits and to generate new interest-earning assets;\n\u2022\nour success in deploying the cash received in the BPNA Branch Acquisition, on a timely basis, into assets, including loans and investment securities, bearing sufficiently high yields without incurring unacceptable credit or interest rate risk;\n\u2022\nour ability to control the incremental noninterest expense from the BPNA branches in a manner that enables us to maintain a favorable overall efficiency ratio;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain and attract appropriate personnel to staff the BPNA branches; and\n\u2022\nour ability to earn acceptable levels of noninterest income, including fee income, from the BPNA branches.\nNo assurance can be given that we will be able to integrate the BPNA branches successfully, that the BPNA Branch Acquisition will not expose us to unknown material liabilities, that the operation of the BPNA branches will not adversely affect our results of operations, that we will be able to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by our existing banking business, that we will be able to compete effectively in new market areas, or that we will be able to manage growth resulting from the BPNA Branch Acquisition effectively. The difficulties or costs we may encounter in the integration could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe pricing of deposits and loan run-off rates could be substantially different than what we have projected in connection with our planning for the BPNA Branch Acquisition and the integration of the acquired branches.\nIt is not known whether we will be able to retain loan and deposit relationships acquired in the BPNA Branch Acquisition over time.\nWe will need to convert customer loan and deposit data from BPNA\u2019s data processing system to our data processing systems. Problems or errors in the customer account conversion process, and customer interface required to replace certain BPNA products and services with comparable products and services of the Bank, could adversely affect customer relationships, increase run-off of deposit and loan customers and result in unexpected charges and costs. Similarly, run-off could increase if we are not able to cost effectively service particular BPNA loan or deposit products with special features. An unanticipated increase in the run-off rate could increase the effective cost to us of the BPNA Branch Acquisition.\nThe credit quality of loans associated with the BPNA Branch Acquisition may be poorer than expected, which would require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and negatively affect our operating results.\nThe Bank acquired $1.07 billion of loans related to the BPNA branches. As part of our due diligence on the BPNA branches, we reviewed a sample of these loans in various categories and found them to be of acceptable credit quality. Our examination of these loans was made using the same criteria, analyses and collateral evaluations that we have traditionally used in the ordinary course of our business. Although we believe the loans we acquired are of acceptable credit quality, and nonperforming loans, non-accrual loans or other real estate owned were generally excluded from the BPNA Branch Acquisition, no assurance can be given as to the future performance of these loans.\nWe may fail to realize the growth prospects and cost savings anticipated as a result of the BPNA Branch Acquisition.\nThe success of the BPNA Branch Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities and growth prospects we expect to result from the addition of the BPNA branches. We may never realize these business opportunities and growth prospects. Integrating operations will be complex and will require significant efforts and expenditures on the part of both us and BPNA. Our management might have its attention diverted while trying to integrate operations and corporate and administrative infrastructures and the cost of integration may exceed our expectations. We may also be required to make unanticipated capital expenditures or investments in order to maintain, improve or sustain the BPNA branches we acquired or take write-offs or impairment charges or recognize amortization expenses resulting from the BPNA Branch Acquisition and may be subject to unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to the BPNA branches we acquired. We might experience increased competition that limits our ability to expand our business, and we might not be able to capitalize on expected business opportunities, including retaining current customers of BPNA. If any of these factors limit our ability to integrate the new branches successfully or on a timely basis, the expectations of future results of operations following the BPNA Branch Acquisition might not be met.\nIt is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of our ongoing businesses, tax costs or inefficiencies, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, information technology systems, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees or other third parties or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the BPNA Branch Acquisition and could harm our financial performance.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction and acquisition-related integration costs in connection with the BPNA Branch Acquisition.\nWe have developed a plan to integrate the BPNA branches we acquired. Although we anticipate achieving cost synergies in connection with the BPNA Branch Acquisition, we also expect to incur costs to implement such cost savings measures. We have incurred, and anticipate that we will continue to incur certain non-recurring charges in connection with this integration, including charges associated with integrating processes and systems. At this time, we cannot identify the timing, nature and amount of all such charges. Further, we have incurred, and currently expect to continue to incur significant transaction costs that will be charged as an expense in the period incurred. The significant transaction costs and acquisition-related integration costs could materially adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid. The net benefit associated with the anticipated elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the BPNA branches, may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. Accordingly, the cost and operational savings may not be achievable in our anticipated amount or timeframe or at all. Investors should not place undue reliance on the anticipated benefits of the BPNA Branch Acquisition in making an investment decision with respect to our securities.\nRisks Relating to Our Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have recently taken a number of actions to remediate a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. We may be at risk for future material weaknesses, particularly if the new control measures we implemented do not continue to operate effectively.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In 2014, as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2013, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q/A for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2014 and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended June 30, 2014 and September 30, 2014, management identified immaterial errors related to prior financial reporting periods that indicated certain deficiencies existed in our internal control over financial reporting. Management concluded that, for the 2013 reporting period, these deficiencies, when aggregated, could have resulted in a material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements that would not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis, and as such, these control deficiencies resulted in a material weakness.\nA material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As described in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have recently taken a number of actions to remediate the material weakness referred to above. Our management has determined that these remediation actions were effectively designed and demonstrated effective operations for a sufficient period of time to enable us to conclude that this material weakness had been remediated as of December 31, 2014. However, we must continue to monitor and evaluate the new control measures we implemented to ensure that they continue to operate effectively and we may be at risk for future material weaknesses, particularly if these measures do not continue to operate effectively. If additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, this could result in material\nmisstatements in our consolidated financial statements and/or adversely affect our ability to timely file our annual and quarterly reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, either of which could have a negative effect on the trading prices of our securities and our ability to access the capital markets.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Operating Environment\nOur business strategy includes significant growth plans, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\nWe have pursued and intend to continue to pursue an organic and acquisition growth strategy for our business. We regularly evaluate potential acquisitions and expansion opportunities. If appropriate opportunities present themselves, we expect to engage in selected acquisitions of financial institutions, branch acquisitions and other business growth initiatives or undertakings. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify appropriate opportunities, that we will be able to negotiate or finance such activities or that such activities, if undertaken, will be successful.\nThere are risks associated with our growth strategy. To the extent that we grow through acquisitions, we cannot ensure that we will be able to adequately or profitably manage this growth. Acquiring other banks, branches or other assets, as well as other expansion activities, involves various risks including the risks of incorrectly assessing the credit quality of acquired assets, encountering greater than expected costs of integrating acquired banks or branches, the risk of loss of customers and/or employees of the acquired institution or branch, executing cost savings measures, not achieving revenue enhancements and otherwise not realizing the transaction\u2019s anticipated benefits. Our ability to address these matters successfully cannot be assured. In addition, our strategic efforts may divert resources or management\u2019s attention from ongoing business operations, may require investment in integration and in development and enhancement of additional operational and reporting processes and controls, and may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny. To finance an acquisition, we may borrow funds, thereby increasing our leverage and diminishing our liquidity, or raise additional capital, which could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders.\nOur growth initiatives may also require us to recruit experienced personnel to assist in such initiatives. Accordingly, the failure to identify and retain such personnel would place significant limitations on our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy. In addition, to the extent we expand our lending beyond our current market areas, we could incur additional risks related to those new market areas. We may not be able to expand our market presence in our existing market areas or successfully enter new markets.\nIf we do not successfully execute our acquisition growth plan, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and growth prospects. In addition, if we were to conclude that the value of an acquired business had decreased and that the related goodwill had been impaired, that conclusion would result in an impairment of goodwill charge to us, which would adversely affect our results of operations. While we believe we will have the executive management resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage our future growth, there can be no assurance growth opportunities will be available or that we will successfully manage our growth.\nIn addition to the risks presented by the recently completed BPNA Branch Acquisition, our acquisitions of PBOC, The Palisades Group, RenovationReady and CS Financial may present certain risks to our business and operations.\nWe completed our acquisitions of PBOC and The Palisades Group on July 1, 2013 and September 11, 2013, respectively, and our wholly owned subsidiary, the Bank completed the acquisitions of RenovationReady and CS Financial on January 31, 2014 and October 31, 2013, respectively. Difficulties in capitalizing on the opportunities presented by these acquisitions may prevent us from fully achieving the expected benefits from the acquisitions, or may cause the achievement of such expected benefits to take longer than expected.\nFurther, the assimilation of PBOC\u2019s customers and markets could result in higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key employees, disruption of our businesses, or otherwise adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. These matters could have an adverse effect on us for an undetermined period. We will likely be subject to similar risks and difficulties in connection with any future acquisitions.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are dependent on the economy, particularly in the Bank\u2019s market areas. A deterioration in economic conditions in the market areas we serve may impact our earnings adversely and could increase the credit risk of our loan and lease portfolio.\nOur primary market area is concentrated in the greater San Diego, Orange, and Los Angeles counties. Adverse economic conditions in any of these, market areas can reduce our rate of growth, affect our customers\u2019 ability to repay loans and leases\nand adversely impact our financial condition and earnings. General economic conditions, including inflation, unemployment and money supply fluctuations, also may affect our profitability adversely.\nA deterioration in economic conditions in the market areas we serve could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022\nDemand for our products and services may decline;\n\u2022\nLoan and lease delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\nCollateral for our loans and leases may further decline in value; and\n\u2022\nThe amount of our low-cost or non-interest-bearing deposits may decrease.\nWe cannot accurately predict the effect of the weakness in the national economy on our future operating results.\nThe national economy in general and the financial services sector in particular continue to face significant challenges. We cannot accurately predict the possibility of the economy\u2019s return to recessionary conditions or to a period of economic weakness, which would adversely impact the markets we serve. Any deterioration in national or local economic conditions would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and any economic weakness could present substantial risks for the banking industry and for us.\nThere are risks associated with our lending activities and our allowance for loan and lease losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb probable incurred losses in our loan and lease portfolio.\nLending money is a substantial part of our business. Every loan and lease carries a certain risk that it will not be repaid in accordance with its terms or that any underlying collateral will not be sufficient to assure repayment. This risk is affected by, among other things:\n\u2022\nCash flow of the borrower and/or the project being financed;\n\u2022\nIn the case of a collateralized loan or lease, the changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral;\n\u2022\nThe credit history of a particular borrower;\n\u2022\nChanges in economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nThe duration of the loan or lease.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses which we believe is appropriate to provide for probable incurred losses in our loan and lease portfolio. The amount of this allowance is determined by our management through a periodic review and consideration of several factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nAn ongoing review of the quality, size and diversity of the loan and lease portfolio;\n\u2022\nEvaluation of non-performing loans and leases;\n\u2022\nHistorical default and loss experience;\n\u2022\nHistorical recovery experience;\n\u2022\nExisting economic conditions;\n\u2022\nRisk characteristics of the various classifications of loans and leases; and\n\u2022\nThe amount and quality of collateral, including guarantees, securing the loans and leases.\nIf our loan and lease losses exceed our allowance for loan and lease losses, our business, financial condition and profitability may suffer.\nThe determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan and lease portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans and leases. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses, we review our loans and leases and the loss and delinquency experience, and evaluate economic conditions and make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. If our estimates are incorrect, the allowance for loan and lease losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio, resulting in the need for additions to our allowance through an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses. Deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans and leases, identification of additional problem loans and leases and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Our allowance for loan and lease losses was 0.75 percent of total loans and leases held for investment and 76.81 percent of nonperforming loans and leases at December 31, 2014. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses or the recognition of further charge-offs, based on judgments different than that of management. If charge-offs in future periods exceed the\nallowance for loan and lease losses, we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan and lease losses. Any increases in the provision for loan and lease losses will result in a decrease in net income and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by credit risk associated with residential property and declining property values.\nAt December 31, 2014, $1.30 billion, or 33.0 percent of our total loans and leases, was secured by single family residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit. This type of lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. The decline in residential real estate values as a result of the downturn in the California housing markets has reduced the value of the real estate collateral securing these types of loans and increased the risk that we would incur losses if borrowers default on their loans. Residential loans with high combined loan-to-value ratios generally will be more sensitive to declining property values than those with lower combined loan-to-value ratios and therefore may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses. In addition, if the borrowers sell their homes, the borrowers may be unable to repay their loans in full from the sale proceeds. As a result, these loans may experience higher rates of delinquencies, defaults and losses, which will in turn adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to our level of adjustable rate loans.\nA substantial majority of our real estate secured loans held are adjustable-rate loans. Any rise in prevailing market interest rates may result in increased payments for borrowers who have adjustable rate mortgage loans, increasing the possibility of defaults that may adversely affect our profitability.\nOur underwriting practices may not protect us against losses in our loan portfolio.\nWe seek to mitigate the risks inherent in our loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting practices, including: analyzing a borrower\u2019s credit history, financial statements, tax returns and cash flow projections; valuing collateral based on reports of independent appraisers; and verifying liquid assets. Although we believe that our underwriting criteria are, and historically have been, appropriate for the various kinds of loans we make, we have incurred losses on loans that have met these criteria, and may continue to experience higher than expected losses depending on economic factors and consumer behavior. In addition, our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage, and underwrite our customers become less predictive of future behaviors. Finally, we may have higher credit risk, or experience higher credit losses, to the extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral. At December 31, 2014, 80.4 percent of our commercial real estate loans and 93.4 percent of our originated SFR mortgage loans were secured by collateral in Southern California. Deterioration in real estate values and underlying economic conditions in Southern California could result in significantly higher credit losses to our portfolio.\nOur non-traditional and interest-only single-family residential loans expose us to increased lending risk.\nMany of the residential mortgage loans we have originated for investment consisted of non-traditional SFR mortgage loans that do not conform to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines as a result of loan-to-value ratios or debt-to-income ratios, loan terms, loan size (exceeding agency limits) or other exceptions from agency underwriting guidelines.\nMoreover, many of these loans do not meet the qualified mortgage definition established by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB), and therefore contain additional regulatory and legal risks. See \"-Rulemaking changes by the CFPB in particular are expected to result in higher regulatory and compliance costs that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\u201d In addition, the secondary market demand for nonconforming mortgage loans generally is limited, and consequently, we may have a difficult time selling the nonconforming loans in our portfolio were we to decide to do so.\nIn the case of interest-only loans, a borrower\u2019s monthly payment is subject to change when the loan converts to fully-amortizing status. Since the borrower\u2019s monthly payment may increase by a substantial amount, even without an increase in prevailing market interest rates, the borrower might not be able to afford the increased monthly payment. In addition, interest-only loans have a large, balloon payment at the end of the loan term, which the borrower may be unable to pay. Negative amortization involves a greater risk to us because credit risk exposure increases when the loan incurs negative amortization and the value of the home serving as collateral for the loan does not increase proportionally. Negative amortization is only permitted up to 110 percent of the original loan to value ratio during the first five years the loan is outstanding, with payments adjusting periodically as provided in the loan documents, potentially resulting in higher payments by the borrower. The adjustment of these loans to higher payment requirements can be a substantial factor in higher loan delinquency levels because the borrowers may not be able to make the higher payments. Also, real estate values may decline, and credit standards may\ntighten in concert with the higher payment requirement, making it difficult for borrowers to sell their homes or refinance their loans to pay off their mortgage obligations. For these reasons, interest-only loans and negative amortization loans are considered to have an increased risk of delinquency, default and foreclosure than conforming loans and may result in higher levels of realized losses.\nOur income property loans, consisting of commercial and multi-family real estate loans, involve higher principal amounts than other loans and repayment of these loans may be dependent on factors outside our control or the control of our borrowers.\nWe originate commercial and multi-family real estate loans for individuals and businesses for various purposes, which are secured by commercial properties. These loans typically involve higher principal amounts than other types of loans, and repayment is dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service, which may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. For example, if the cash flow from the borrower\u2019s project is reduced as a result of leases not being obtained or renewed in a timely manner or at all, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Commercial and multi-family real estate loans also expose us to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans typically cannot be sold as easily as residential real estate. In addition, many of our commercial and multi-family real estate loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity. Such balloon payments may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property in order to make the payment, which may increase the risk of default or non-payment.\nIf we foreclose on a commercial or multi-family real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than for residential mortgage loans because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Additionally, commercial and multi-family real estate loans generally have relatively large balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Accordingly, if we make any errors in judgment in the collectability of our commercial and multi-family real estate loans, any resulting charge-offs may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our residential or consumer loan portfolios. As of December 31, 2014, our commercial and multi-family real estate loans totaled $1.96 billion, or 49.5 percent of our total loans and leases.\nOur portfolio of Green Loans subjects us to greater risks of loss.\nWe have a portfolio of Green Account home equity loans which generally have a fifteen year draw period with interest-only payment requirements, and a balloon payment requirement at the end of the draw period. The Green Loans include an associated \u201cclearing account\u201d that allows all types of deposit and withdrawal transactions to be performed by the borrower during the term. We ceased originating new Green Loans in 2011; however, existing Green Loan borrowers are entitled to continue to draw on their Green Loans. At December 31, 2014, the balance of Green Loans in our portfolio totaled $128.2 million, or 3.2 percent of our total loans and leases.\nIn 2011, we implemented an information reporting system which allowed us to capture more detailed information than was previously possible, including transaction level data concerning our Green Loans. Although such transaction level data would have enabled us to more closely monitor trends in the credit quality of our Green Loans, we do not possess the enhanced transaction level data relating to the Green Loans for periods prior to the implementation of those enhanced systems. Although we do not believe that the absence of such historical data itself represents a material impediment to our current mechanisms for monitoring the credit quality of the Green Loans, until we compile sufficient transaction level data going forward we are limited in our ability to use historical information to monitor trends in the portfolio that might assist us in anticipating credit problems. Green Loans expose us to greater credit risk than other residential mortgage loans because they are non- amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity. Although the loans require the borrower to make monthly interest payments, we are also subject to an increased risk of loss in connection with the Green Loans because payments due under the loans can be made by means of additional advances drawn by the borrower, up to the amount of the credit limit, thereby increasing our overall loss exposure due to negative amortization. The balloon payment due on maturity may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property in order to make the payment, which may increase the risk of default or non-payment. Our ability to take remedial actions in response to these additional risks of loss is limited by the terms and conditions of the Green Loans and our alternatives consist primarily of the ability to curtail additional borrowing when we determine that either the collateral value of the underlying real property or the credit worthiness of the borrower no longer supports the level of credit originally extended. Additionally, many of our Green Loans have larger balances than traditional residential mortgage loans, and accordingly, if the loans go into default either during the draw period or at maturity, any resulting charge-offs may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with traditional residential loans.\nIf our investments in other real estate owned are not properly valued or sufficiently reserved to cover actual losses, or if we are required to increase our valuation reserves, our earnings could be reduced.\nWe obtain updated valuations in the form of appraisals and broker price opinions when a loan has been foreclosed upon and the property is taken in as other real estate owned (OREO), and at certain other times during the asset\u2019s holding period. Our net book value (NBV) in the loan at the time of foreclosure and thereafter is compared to the updated market value (fair value) of the foreclosed property less estimated selling costs. A charge-off is recorded for any excess in the asset\u2019s NBV over its fair value. If our valuation process is incorrect, the fair value of our investments in OREO may not be sufficient to recover our NBV in such assets, resulting in the need for additional write-downs. Additional write-downs to our investments in OREO could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our bank regulators periodically review our OREO and may require us to recognize further write-downs. Any increase in our write-downs, as required by such regulator, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2014, we had OREO of $423 thousand.\nOur portfolio of \u201cre-performing\u201d loans subjects us to a greater risk of loss.\nWe have a portfolio of re-performing residential mortgage loans which we purchased in several large pools at a discount to the outstanding principal balance on the loans. These re-performing loans were discounted because either (i) the borrower was delinquent at the time of the loan purchase or had previously been delinquent and had become current prior to our purchase of the loan, or (ii) because the loan had been modified from its original terms. We purchased the loans because we believe that we can successfully service the loans and have the borrowers consistently meet their obligations under the loan, which will increase the value of the loans. However, re-performing loans expose us to greater credit risk than other residential mortgage loans because they have a higher risk of delinquency, default and foreclosure than other residential mortgage loans and may result in higher levels of realized losses.\nRepayment of our commercial and industrial loans is often dependent on the cash flows of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may not be sufficient to repay the loan in the event of default.\nWe make our commercial and industrial loans primarily based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Collateral securing commercial and industrial loans may depreciate over time, be difficult to appraise and fluctuate in value. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect the amounts due from its customers. As of December 31, 2014, our commercial and industrial loans totaled $490.9 million, or 12.4 percent of our total loans and leases.\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to real properties which we may acquire.\nIn recent years, due to weakness of the U.S. economy and, more specifically, the California economy, including higher levels of unemployment than the nationwide average and declines in real estate values, many borrowers have been unable to meet their loan repayment obligations and, as a result, we have had to initiate foreclosure proceedings with respect to and take title to an increased number of real properties that had collateralized their loans. As an owner of such properties, we could become subject to environmental liabilities and incur substantial costs for any property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up that may be required due to any environmental contamination that may be found to exist at any of those properties, even though we did not engage in the activities that led to such contamination. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties seeking damages for environmental contamination emanating from the site. If we were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities or costs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.\nThe expansion of our single family residential mortgage loan originations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our loan originations business consists of providing purchase money loans to homebuyers and refinancing existing loans. The origination of purchase money mortgage loans is greatly influenced by independent third parties involved in the home buying process such as realtors and builders. As a result, our ability to secure relationships with such independent third parties will affect our ability to grow our purchase money mortgage loan volume and, thus, our loan originations business. Our retail branches and retail call center also originate refinancings of existing mortgage loans, which are very sensitive to increases in interest rates, and may decrease significantly if interest rates rise.\nOur wholesale originations business operates largely through third party mortgage brokers who are not contractually obligated to do business with us. Further, our competitors also have relationships with our brokers and actively compete with us in our efforts to expand our broker networks. Accordingly, we may not be successful in maintaining our existing relationships or expanding our broker networks.\nWe have made substantial investments to grow our residential mortgage lending business in recent quarters, including adding experienced mortgage loan officers and administrators and management, leasing additional space at our headquarters, opening additional loan production offices, and investing in technology. Our residential mortgage lending business may not generate sufficient revenues to enable us to recover our substantial investment in our residential mortgage lending business, or may not grow sufficiently to contribute to earnings in relation to our investment. Moreover, we may be unable to sell the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market at a profit due to changes in interest rates or a reduction in the demand for mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market. Accordingly, our investment in and expansion of our residential mortgage lending business could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn increase in interest rates, change in the programs offered by governmental sponsored entities (GSE) or our ability to qualify for such programs may reduce our mortgage revenues, which would negatively impact our non-interest income.\nOur mortgage banking operations provide a significant portion of our non-interest income. We generate mortgage revenues primarily from gains on the sale of single-family residential loans pursuant to programs currently offered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and other investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans. Any future changes in these programs, our eligibility to participate in such programs, the criteria for loans to be accepted or laws that significantly affect the activity of such entities could, in turn, materially adversely affect our results of operations. Further, in a rising or higher interest rate environment, our originations of mortgage loans may decrease, resulting in fewer loans that are available to be sold to investors. This would result in a decrease in mortgage revenues and a corresponding decrease in non-interest income. In addition, our results of operations are affected by the amount of non-interest expense associated with mortgage banking activities, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, equipment and data processing expense and other operating costs. During periods of reduced loan demand, our results of operations may be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to reduce expenses commensurate with the decline in loan originations.\nSecondary mortgage market conditions could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and earnings.\nIn addition to being affected by interest rates, the secondary mortgage markets are subject to investor demand for single-family residential loans and mortgage-backed securities and investor yield requirements for those loans and securities. These conditions may fluctuate or even worsen in the future. Our business strategy is to originate conforming conventional and government residential mortgage loans and a portion of our nonconforming jumbo conventional residential mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market. Originating loans for sale enables us to earn revenue from fees and gains on loan sales, while reducing our credit risk on the loans as well as our liquidity requirements. We also can use the loan sale proceeds to generate new loans.\nWe rely on government sponsored entities- Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae - to purchase residential mortgage loans that meet their loan requirements and on other capital markets investors to purchase a portion of our residential mortgage loans that do not meet those requirements - referred to as \u201cnonconforming\u201d loans. Our ability to sell residential mortgage loans readily also is dependent upon our ability to remain eligible for the programs offered by GSEs and other market participants. Any significant impairment of our eligibility to participate in the programs offered by the GSEs and other market participants could materially and adversely affect us. Further, the criteria for loans to be accepted under such programs may be changed from time-to-time by the sponsoring entity which could result in a lower volume of corresponding loan originations or other administrative costs. Reduced demand in the capital markets could cause us to retain more nonconforming loans. In addition, no assurance can be given that GSEs will not materially limit their purchases of conforming loans, including because of capital constraints, or change their criteria for conforming loans (e.g., maximum loan amount or borrower eligibility). Each of the GSEs is currently in conservatorship, with its primary regulator, the Federal Housing Agency acting as conservator. We cannot predict if, when or how the conservatorship will end, or any associated changes to the GSEs business structure and operations that could result. In addition, there are various proposals to reform the role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing finance market. The extent and timing of any such regulatory reform regarding the housing finance market and the GSEs, including whether the GSEs will continue to exist in their current form, as well as any effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results, are uncertain.\nSignificant changes in the secondary mortgage market or a prolonged period of secondary market illiquidity may reduce our loan production volumes and could have a material adverse impact on our future earnings and financial condition.\nIn addition, the secondary market demand for nonconforming jumbo loans generally is not as strong as the demand for conventional loans and can be volatile, reducing the demand or pricing for those loans; consequently, we may have a more difficult time selling the nonconforming jumbo loans that we originate.\nChanges in interest rates may change the value of our mortgage servicing rights, which may increase the volatility of our earnings.\nAs a result of our sales of mortgage loans to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, we have a growing portfolio of mortgage servicing rights. A mortgage servicing right is the right to service a mortgage loan - collect principal, interest and escrow amounts - for a fee. Our mortgage servicing rights support our mortgage banking strategies and diversify revenue streams from our mortgage banking segment.\nWe measure and carry all of our residential mortgage servicing rights using the fair value measurement method. Fair value is determined as the present value of estimated future net servicing income, calculated based on a number of variables, including assumptions about the likelihood of prepayment by borrowers.\nThe primary risk associated with mortgage servicing rights is that in a declining interest rate environment, they will likely lose a substantial portion of their value as a result of higher than anticipated prepayments. Moreover, if prepayments are greater than expected, the cash we receive over the life of the mortgage loans would be reduced. Conversely, these assets generally increase in value in a rising interest rate environment to the extent that prepayments are slower than previously estimated. Although our mortgage servicing rights diversify the revenue streams from our mortgage banking segment, the increasing size of our mortgage servicing rights portfolio may increase our interest rate risk and correspondingly, the volatility of our earnings.\nAt December 31, 2014 and 2013, our mortgage servicing rights had fair values of $19.1 million and $13.5 million, respectively. Changes in fair value of our mortgage servicing rights are recorded to earnings in each period. Depending on the interest rate environment, it is possible that the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights may be reduced in the future. If such changes in fair value significantly reduce the carrying value of our mortgage servicing rights, our financial condition and results of operations would be negatively affected.\nCertain hedging strategies that we use to manage investment in mortgage loans held for sale and interest rate lock commitments may be ineffective to offset any adverse changes in the fair value of these assets due to changes in interest rates and market liquidity.\nWe use derivative instruments to hedge the interest rate risks associated with the fair value of certain mortgage loans held for sale and interest rate lock commitments. Our hedging strategies are highly susceptible to basis risk, market volatility and changes in the shape of the yield curve, among other factors. In addition, hedging strategies rely on assumptions and projections regarding assets and general market factors. If these assumptions and projections prove to be incorrect or our hedging strategies do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, we may incur losses that would adversely impact earnings.\nAny breach of representations and warranties made by us to our residential mortgage loan purchasers or credit default on our loan sales may require us to repurchase residential mortgage loans we have sold.\nWe sell a majority of the residential mortgage loans we originate in the secondary market pursuant to agreements that generally require us to repurchase loans in the event of a breach of a representation or warranty made by us to the loan purchaser. Any fraud or misrepresentation during the mortgage loan origination process, whether by us, the borrower, mortgage broker, or other party in the transaction, or, in some cases, upon any early payment default on such mortgage loans, may require us to repurchase such loans.\nWe believe that, as a result of the increased defaults and foreclosures during the past several years resulting in increased demand for repurchases and indemnification in the secondary market, many purchasers of residential mortgage loans are particularly aware of the conditions under which originators must indemnify or repurchase loans and would benefit from enforcing any repurchase remedies they may have. We believe that our exposure to repurchases under our representations and warranties includes the current unpaid balance of all loans we have sold. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we sold residential mortgage loans aggregating $2.75 billion, $1.86 billion and $477 million, respectively.\nTo recognize the potential loan repurchase or indemnification losses, we recorded a total reserve of $8.3 million at December 31, 2014. Increases to this reserve reduce mortgage banking revenue. The determination of the appropriate level of the reserve inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make estimates of repurchase and indemnification risks and expected losses. The estimates used could be inaccurate, resulting in a level of reserve that is less than actual losses.\nDeterioration in the economy, an increase in interest rates or a decrease in home values could increase customer defaults on loans that were sold and increase demand for repurchases and indemnification and increase our losses from loan repurchases and indemnification. If we are required to indemnify loan purchasers or repurchase loans and incur losses that exceed our reserve, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any claims asserted against us in the future by loan purchasers may result in liabilities or legal expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to maintain a strong core deposit base or other low-cost funding sources.\nWe expect to depend on checking, savings and money market deposit account balances and other forms of customer deposits as the primary source of funding for our lending activities. Our future growth will largely depend on our ability to maintain a strong core deposit base, to provide a less costly and more stable source of funding. It may prove difficult to maintain our core deposit base. There may be competitive pressures to pay higher interest rates on deposits, which would increase our funding costs. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments (or into similar products at other institutions that may provide a higher rate of return), we could lose a relatively low cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income. Additionally, any such loss of funds could result in reduced loan originations, which could materially negatively impact our growth strategy and results of operations.\nOther-than-temporary impairment charges in our investment securities portfolio could result in losses and adversely affect our continuing operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company\u2019s investment securities portfolio consisted of 92 securities, 49 of which were in an unrealized loss position. The majority of unrealized losses are related to the Company\u2019s private label residential mortgage-backed securities and agency residential mortgage-backed securities, as discussed below.\nThe Company\u2019s private label residential mortgage-backed securities that are in a loss position had a fair value of $1.7 million with unrealized losses of $13 thousand at December 31, 2014. The Company\u2019s agency residential mortgage-backed securities that are in a loss position had a fair value of $90.4 million with unrealized losses of approximately $605 thousand at December 31, 2014. The Company monitors to ensure it has adequate credit support and as of December 31, 2014, the Company believes there is no other than temporary impairment (OTTI) and did not have the intent to sell these securities and it is likely that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery. The portfolio is evaluated using either OTTI guidance provided by ASC 320 or ASC 325. Investment securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity are generally evaluated for OTTI under ASC 320. However, certain residential mortgage-backed securities that had credit ratings at time of purchase below AA are evaluated using guidance provided by ASC 325. The residential mortgage-backed securities in the Company\u2019s portfolio referenced above were rated AA or above at purchase and are not within the scope of ASC 325. For more information about ASC 320 and ASC 325, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nWe closely monitor our investment securities for changes in credit risk. The valuation of our investment securities also is influenced by external market and other factors, including implementation of SEC and Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance on fair value accounting. Accordingly, if market conditions deteriorate further and we determine our holdings of other investment securities are OTTI, our future earnings, stockholders\u2019 equity, regulatory capital and continuing operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRising interest rates may hurt our profits.\nTo be profitable, we have to earn more money in interest that we receive on loans and investments than we pay to our depositors and lenders in interest. If interest rates rise, our net interest income and the value of our assets could be reduced if interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, increases more quickly than interest received on interest-earning assets, such as loans, other mortgage-related investments and investment securities. This is most likely to occur if short-term interest rates increase at a faster rate than long-term interest rates, which would cause net income to go down. In addition, rising interest rates may hurt our income, because that may reduce the demand for loans and the value of our securities. In a rapidly changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to manage our interest rate risk effectively, which would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face significant operational risks.\nWe operate many different financial service functions and rely on the ability of our employees, third-party vendors and systems to process a significant number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss from operations, including fraud by\nemployees or outside persons, employees\u2019 execution of incorrect or unauthorized transactions, data processing and technology errors or hacking and breaches of internal control systems.\nOur enterprise risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for losses.\nOur enterprise risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established comprehensive policies and procedures and an internal control framework designed to provide a sound operational environment for the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit risk, market risk (interest rate and price risks), liquidity risk, operational risk, compliance risk, strategic risk, and reputational risk. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our current and future risk management strategies, including risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. In certain instances, we rely on models to measure, monitor and predict risks. However, these models are inherently limited because they involve techniques, including the use of historical data in some circumstances, and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which we operate, nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes. There is no assurance that these models will appropriately capture all relevant risks or accurately predict future events or exposures. Accurate and timely enterprise-wide risk information is necessary to enhance management\u2019s decision-making in times of crisis. If our enterprise risk management framework proves ineffective or if our enterprise-wide management information is incomplete or inaccurate, we could suffer unexpected losses, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving. We may fail to fully understand the implications of changes in our businesses or the financial markets or fail to adequately or timely enhance our enterprise risk framework to address those changes. If our enterprise risk framework is ineffective, either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets, regulatory requirements, our businesses, our counterparties, clients or service providers or for other reasons, we could incur losses, suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates.\nAn important aspect of our enterprise risk management framework is creating a risk culture in which all employees fully understand that there is risk in every aspect of our business and the importance of managing risk as it relates to their job functions. We continue to enhance our enterprise risk management program to support our risk culture, ensuring that it is sustainable and appropriate to our role as a major financial institution. Nonetheless, if we fail to create the appropriate environment that sensitizes all of our employees to managing risk, our business could be adversely impacted. For more information on our risk management framework, see \u201cItem 1. Business-Lending Activities-Governance.\u201d\nManaging reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees.\nThreats to our reputation can come from many sources, including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally, unethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality, compliance deficiencies and questionable or fraudulent activities of our customers. We have policies and procedures in place to promote ethical conduct and protect our reputation. However, these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Negative publicity regarding our business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers, investors and employees, costly litigation, a decline in revenues and increased governmental oversight.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nThe held for sale loan balance in our mortgage banking business represents mortgage loans that are in the process of being sold to various investors. Loan balances steadily accumulate and then decrease at the time of sale. We fund these balances through short term funding, primarily through FHLB advances, which require collateral. In the event we experience a significant increase in our held for sale loan balances, our liquidity could be negatively impacted as we increase our short term borrowings and therefore our required collateral. Although we have access to other sources of contingent liquidity, we could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to effectively manage this risk.\nWe depend on our key employees.\nOur future prospects are and will remain highly dependent on our directors and executive officers. Our success will, to some extent, depend on the continued service of our directors and continued employment of the executive officers. The unexpected loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on our business. Although we have entered into employment agreements with members of our senior management team, no assurance can be given that these individuals will continue to be employed by us. The loss of any of these individuals could negatively affect our ability to achieve our growth strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe currently hold a significant amount of bank-owned life insurance.\nAt December 31, 2014, we held $19.1 million of bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) on certain key and former employees and executives, with a cash surrender value of $19.1 million. The eventual repayment of the cash surrender value is subject to the ability of the various insurance companies to pay death benefits or to return the cash surrender value to us if needed for liquidity purposes. We continually monitor the financial strength of the various companies with whom we carry these policies. However, any one of these companies could experience a decline in financial strength, which could impair its ability to pay benefits or return our cash surrender value. If we need to liquidate these policies for liquidity purposes, we would be subject to taxation on the increase in cash surrender value and penalties for early termination, both of which would adversely impact earnings.\nIf our investment in the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco becomes impaired, our earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity could decrease.\nAt December 31, 2014, we owned $29.8 million in Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock. We are required to own this stock to be a member of and to obtain advances from our FHLB. This stock is not marketable and can only be redeemed by our FHLB. Our FHLB\u2019s financial condition is linked, in part, to the eleven other members of the FHLB System and to accounting rules and asset quality risks that could materially lower their capital, which would cause our FHLB stock to be deemed impaired, resulting in a decrease in our earnings and assets.\nWe rely on numerous external vendors.\nWe rely on numerous external vendors to provide us with products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. Accordingly, our operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements because of changes in the vendor's organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services or strategic focus or for any other reason, could be disruptive to our operations, which in turn could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We also could be adversely affected to the extent such an agreement is not renewed by the third party vendor or is renewed on terms less favorable to us.\nWe are subject to certain risks in connection with our use of technology.\nOur security measures may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of a cyber attack or cyber theft.\nCommunications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships, our general ledger and virtually all other aspects of our business. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, the security of our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code and cyber attacks that could have a security impact. If one or more of these events occur, this could jeopardize our or our customers' confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers or counterparties. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. We could also suffer significant reputational damage.\nSecurity breaches in our internet banking activities could further expose us to possible liability and damage our reputation. Any compromise of our security also could deter customers from using our internet banking services that involve the transmission\nof confidential information. We rely on standard internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of our security measures, which could result in significant legal liability and significant damage to our reputation and our business.\nOur security measures may not protect us from systems failures or interruptions.\nWhile we have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures and interruptions, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do. In addition, we outsource certain aspects of our data processing and other operational functions to certain third-party providers. If our third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty in communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely impacted. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any systems failure or interruption could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to legal liability. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on communications, information, operating and financial control systems technology from third-party service providers, and we may suffer an interruption in those systems.\nWe rely heavily on third-party service providers for much of our communications, information, operating and financial control systems technology, including our online banking services and data processing systems. Any failure or interruption, or breaches in security, of these systems could result in failures or interruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, servicing and/or loan origination systems and, therefore, could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, interruptions in service and security breaches could lead existing customers to terminate their banking relationships with us and could make it more difficult for us to attract new banking customers.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and our operations and income may be affected adversely by changes in laws, rules and regulations governing our operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the FDIC. The Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its fiscal and monetary policies determine in a large part our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest margin. Federal Reserve Board policies can also materially affect the value of financial instruments that we hold, such as debt securities, certain mortgage loans held for sale and mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). Its policies also can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy their obligations to us. Changes in policies of the Federal Reserve Board are beyond our control and the impact of changes in those policies on our activities and results of operations can be difficult to predict.\nThe Company and the Bank are heavily regulated. This regulation is to protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, and not stockholders. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on a bank\u2019s operations, reclassify assets, determine the adequacy of a bank\u2019s allowance for loan and lease losses and determine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed.\nThe federal banking regulatory agencies have adopted rules to implement a new global regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy referred to as Basel III, as well as to implement the capital requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act. The new rules increase minimum capital ratios, add a new minimum common equity ratio, add a new capital conservation buffer, and change the risk-weightings of certain assets. The new rules became effective January 1, 2015, with some changes transitioned to full effectiveness over two to four years.\nCongress and federal agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, new regulations or legislation or additional deposit insurance premiums could have a material adverse impact on our operations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws and applicable regulations are subject to frequent change. Any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or growth prospects. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and supporting regulations could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act provides for, among other things, new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions and their holding companies. These changes may result in additional restrictions on investments and other activities.\nRegulations under the Dodd-Frank Act significantly impact our operations, and we expect to continue to face increased regulation. These regulations may affect the manner in which we do business and the products and services that we provide, affect or restrict our ability to compete in our current businesses or our ability to enter into or acquire new businesses, reduce or limit our revenue or impose additional fees, assessments or taxes on us, intensify the regulatory supervision of us and the financial services industry, and adversely affect our business operations. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, established a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB) with broad authority to administer and enforce a new federal regulatory framework of consumer financial regulation. Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have extended implementation periods and require extensive additional rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by various regulatory agencies. The Dodd-Frank Act calls for many administrative rulemakings by various federal agencies to implement various parts of the legislation. While some rules have been finalized or issued in proposed form, many have yet to be proposed. It is impossible to predict when all such additional rules will be issued or finalized, and what the content of such rules will be. We will have to apply resources to ensure that we are in compliance with all applicable provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and any implementing rules, which may increase our costs of operations and adversely impact our earnings. We expect that the Dodd-Frank Act, including current and future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretations of those rules, will reduce our revenues, increase our expenses, require us to change certain of our business practices, increase the regulatory supervision of us, increase our capital requirements and impose additional assessments and costs on us, and otherwise adversely affect our business.\nRulemaking changes implemented by the CFPB in particular are expected to result in higher regulatory and compliance costs that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs indicated above, the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, a new, independent federal agency with broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the laws referenced above, fair lending laws and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, their service providers and certain non-depository entities such as debt collectors and consumer reporting agencies. In the case of banks, such as the Bank, with total assets of less than $10 billion, this examination and enforcement authority is held by the institution\u2019s primary federal banking regulator (the OCC, in the case of the Bank).\nThe CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages including a determination of the borrower\u2019s ability to repay. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d as defined by the CFPB. The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations.\nThe CFPB has finalized a number of significant rules which impact nearly every aspect of the lifecycle of a residential mortgage loan. Among other things, the rules adopted by the CFPB require banks to: (i) develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with a \u201creasonable ability to repay\u201d test and identify whether a loan meets a new definition for a \u201cqualified mortgage,\u201d in which case a rebuttable presumption exists that the creditor extending the loan has satisfied the reasonable ability to repay test; (ii) implement new or revised disclosures, policies and procedures for originating and servicing mortgages including, but not limited to, pre-loan counseling, early intervention with delinquent borrowers and specific loss mitigation procedures for loans secured by a borrower's principal residence; (iii) comply with additional restrictions on mortgage loan originator hiring and compensation; (iv) comply with new disclosure requirements and standards for appraisals and certain financial products; and (v) maintain escrow accounts for higher-priced mortgage loans for a longer period of time.\nIn order to comply with the CFPB rules, we have made significant changes to our residential mortgage business, including investments in technology, training of our personnel, changes in the loan products we offer, changes in compensation of our loan originators and mortgage brokers that do business with us, and a reduction in fees that we charge, We are continuing to analyze the impact that such rules may have on our business. In addition to the exercise of its rulemaking authority, the CFPB\u2019s supervisory powers entitle the CFPB to examine institutions for violations of consumer lending laws, even in the absence of consumer complaints or damages.\nCompliance with the rules and policies adopted by the CFPB has limited the products we may permissibly offer to some or all of our customers, or limit the terms on which those products may be issued, or may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as previously conducted, including our residential mortgage lending business. We may also be required to add compliance personnel or incur other significant compliance-related expenses. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or competitive position may be adversely affected as a result.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements and new capital rules is uncertain.\nIn July 2013, the FRB and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule to revise their risk-based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with the agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule applies to all banking organizations. Among other things, the rule establishes a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5 percent of risk-weighted assets) and a higher minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital requirement (6 percent of risk-weighted assets) and assigns higher risk weightings (150 percent) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The final rule also limits a banking organization\u2019s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5 percent of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, which is in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The final rule became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015. The capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning January 1, 2016, and ending January 1, 2019, when the full capital conservation buffer requirement will be effective. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such activities.\nWhile our current capital levels exceed the new capital requirements, our capital levels could decrease in the future as a result of factors such as acquisitions, faster than anticipated growth, reduced earnings levels, operating losses and other factors. The application of more stringent capital requirements for us could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in our inability to pay dividends or repurchase shares if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements.\nWe are subject to federal and state and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nFederal and state fair lending laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice, CFPB and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. A successful challenge to our performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact our rating under the CRA and result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNon-compliance with the Patriot Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions or operating restrictions.\nThe Patriot and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions or restrictions that could have a material adverse effect on our strategic initiatives. Several banking institutions have received large fines, or suffered limitations on their operations, for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. Although we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nIncreases in deposit insurance premiums and special FDIC assessments will negatively impact our earnings.\nWe may pay higher FDIC premiums in the future. The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum FDIC deposit insurance reserve ratio from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent. The FDIC has adopted a plan under which it will meet this ratio by the statutory deadline of December 31, 2020. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio on institutions with assets less than $10.0 billion. The FDIC has not announced how it will implement this offset. In addition to the minimum reserve ratio, the FDIC must set a designated reserve ratio. The FDIC has set a designated reserve ratio of 2.0, which exceeds the minimum reserve ratio.\nAs required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has adopted final regulations, under which insurance premiums are based on an institution\u2019s total assets minus its Tier 1 capital instead of its deposits. Although our FDIC insurance premiums were initially reduced by these regulations, it is possible that our future insurance premiums will increase.\nOur holding company relies on dividends from the Bank and The Palisades Group for substantially all of its income and the net proceeds of capital raising transactions are currently the primary source of funds for cash dividends to our preferred and common stockholders.\nOur primary source of revenue at the holding company level is earnings of available cash and securities and dividends from the Bank and The Palisades Group and we currently rely on the net proceeds of capital raising transactions as the primary source of funds for cash dividends to our preferred and common stockholders. To the extent we are limited in our ability to raise capital in the future, our ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders could likewise be limited, especially if we are unable to increase the amount of dividends the Bank pays to us. The OCC regulates and, in some cases, must approve the amounts the Bank pays as dividends to us. If either the Bank or The Palisades Group is unable to pay dividends to us, then we may not be able to service our debt, including our Senior Notes and junior subordinated amortizing notes, pay our other obligations or pay cash dividends on our preferred and common stock. Our inability to service our debt, pay our other obligations or pay dividends to our stockholders could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and the value of your investment in our securities.\nWe may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed.\nWe are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. At some point, we may need to raise additional capital to support continued growth, both organically and through acquisitions.\nOur ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through organic growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company has a significant deferred tax asset that may or may not be fully realized.\nThe Company has a significant deferred tax asset (DTA) and cannot assure that it will be fully realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities computed using enacted tax rates. If we determine that we will not achieve sufficient future taxable income to realize our net deferred tax asset, we are required under generally accepted accounting principles to establish a full or partial valuation allowance. If we determine that a valuation allowance is necessary, we are required to incur a charge to operations. We regularly assess available positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. Realization of a deferred tax asset requires us to apply significant judgment and is inherently speculative because it requires estimates that cannot be made with certainty. At December 31, 2014, the Company had a net deferred tax asset of $16.4 million.\nOur ability to utilize our DTA to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if the Company experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d under the Internal Revenue Code.\nAt December 31, 2014, the Company had net DTA of $16.4 million. The Company\u2019s ability to utilize its DTA to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if the Company experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, referred to herein as the Code. In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in the Company\u2019s ownership by \u201c5-percent or more stockholders\u201d (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. If this were to occur, the Company would be subject to an annual\nlimitation on its pre-ownership change DTA equal to the value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, provided that the annual limitation would be increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year.\nWe may experience future goodwill impairment.\nIf our estimates of the fair value of our goodwill change as a result of changes in our business or other factors, we may determine that an impairment charge is necessary. Estimates of fair value are based on a complex model using, among other things, estimated cash flows and industry pricing multiples. Based on the Company's 2014 goodwill impairment testing, the fair values of the three reporting units, commercial banking, mortgage banking and financial advisory and asset management, were in excess of their carrying value. If the fair values of the three reporting units were less than their book value of total common stockholders' equity for an extended period of time, the Company would consider this and other factors, including the anticipated cash flows of each of the reporting units, to determine whether goodwill is impaired. No assurance can be given that the Company will not record an impairment loss on goodwill in the future and any such impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in accounting standards may affect our performance.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time there are changes in the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we report and record our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in a retrospective adjustment to prior financial statements.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may seek to implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible, which could in turn have a material negative effect on our operating results. New lines of business and/or new products or services also could subject us to additional regulatory requirements, increased scrutiny by our regulators and other legal risks.\nStrong competition within our market areas may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market areas, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors have substantially greater name recognition, resources and lending limits than we do and may offer certain services or prices for services that we do not or cannot provide. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our markets. In addition, our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our clients.\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our stockholders.\nProvisions in our charter and bylaws, the corporate law of the State of Maryland and federal regulations could delay, defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit to our stockholders, or otherwise adversely affect the market price of any class of our equity securities. These provisions include: a prohibition on voting shares of common stock beneficially owned in excess of 10 percent of total shares outstanding, supermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations with any person who beneficially owns more than 10 percent of our outstanding common stock; the election of directors to staggered terms of three years; advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors and for proposing matters that stockholders may act on at stockholder meetings, a requirement that only directors may fill a vacancy in our Board of Directors, supermajority voting requirements to remove any of our directors and the other provisions of our charter. Our charter also authorizes our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock, and preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal. In addition, pursuant to federal banking regulations, as a general\nmatter, no person or company, acting individually or in concert with others, may acquire more than 10 percent of our common stock without prior approval from the our federal banking regulator.\nThese provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for holders of our common stock to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our Board of Directors.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations, including our obligations under the Senior Notes and junior subordinated amortizing notes.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes and junior subordinated amortizing notes, will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes and junior subordinated amortizing notes.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be unable to provide new loans, other products or to fund our obligations to existing customers and otherwise implement our business plans, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes and junior subordinated amortizing notes. As a result, we may be unable to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of sufficient operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions of assets or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nOur debt level may harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $633.0 million of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank, $84.8 million in Senior Notes and $12.5 million in junior subordinated amortizing notes. We also had 82,250 shares of preferred stock outstanding, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, issued and outstanding. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to you, because:\n\u2022\nIt could affect our ability to satisfy our financial obligations, including those relating to the Senior Notes and junior subordinated amortizing notes;\n\u2022\nA portion of our cash flows from operations will have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\nIt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future;\n\u2022\nIt may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and\n\u2022\nIt may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders.\nCampaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term stockholder value through various corporate actions. We have had activist investors acquire ownership positions in our common stock and initiate communications with us or others in order to pursue action we believe is designed to benefit them in a manner that may come at our expense or be to the detriment of other stockholders. Responding to actions by activist stockholders can disrupt our operations, adversely affect our profitability or business prospects, and divert the attention of management and our employees from executing our strategic plan discussed under \u201cItem 1. Business-Strategy.\u201d Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction or strategy arising from activist stockholder initiatives could also cause increased reputational, operational, financial, regulatory and other risks, harm our ability to raise new capital, or adversely affect the market price or increase the volatility of our securities.", "PERMNO": 89482, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BANC"}
