{"cik": "353230", "company": "OMNICARE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. - RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur or our client facilities\u2019 failure to comply with Medicaid and Medicare regulations could jeopardize our eligibility to participate in these programs, subject us to other penalties, or otherwise reduce our revenue from these programs.\nOur business is dependent upon revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which are highly regulated. Our or our client facilities\u2019 failure to comply with applicable regulations, even if inadvertent, could adversely affect our reimbursement under these programs and our ability to continue to participate in these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, our failure to comply with applicable Medicare and Medicaid regulations could subject us to other penalties.\nThe significant portion of our revenue that we derive from agreements with payors, including Medicare Part D Plans, and long-term care facility clients could be reduced if such agreements are terminated or changed.\nIn 2014, approximately 58% of our revenue was derived from beneficiaries covered under the Medicare Part D program. Our reimbursement under Medicare Part D, as well as our reimbursement from certain private third-party payors, is determined pursuant to agreements that we negotiate with those payors or their pharmacy benefit manager representatives. Likewise, our reimbursement from SNFs for drugs is determined pursuant to our agreements with them. Certain of these agreements are terminable upon prior notice by the other party. A SNF\u2019s financial difficulty could lead to payment disputes and ultimately to the termination of our agreement with them. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to replace terminated or expired agreements on terms as favorable as our existing agreements or at all. The termination or modification of these agreements could adversely affect our reimbursement from these sources, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, termination of our agreement with a long-term care facility or similar facility customer generally terminates our provision of services to any of the residents of that facility, resulting in the loss of revenue from any source for those residents. Additionally, the proportion of our Medicare Part D business serviced under specific agreements may change over time based upon beneficiary choice, reassignment of beneficiaries to different Medicare Part D Plans, Medicare Part D Plan consolidation or other factors, which could also adversely affect our revenue. Our payor mix (as a percentage of annual sales) for each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 is presented at \u201cNote 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContinuing efforts to contain healthcare costs may reduce our future revenue.\nOur sales and profitability are affected by the efforts of healthcare payors to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare by lowering reimbursement rates, limiting the scope of covered services, and negotiating reduced or capitated pricing arrangements. Many states are facing budget pressures that could result in increased healthcare cost containment efforts. Any changes that lower reimbursement levels under Medicare, Medicaid or other programs could reduce our future revenue. These changes may include modifications in the timing or processing of payments, and other changes intended to limit or decrease the growth of Medicare, Medicaid or third party expenditures. In addition, our profitability may be adversely affected by any efforts of our suppliers to shift healthcare costs by increasing the net prices on the products we obtain from them.\nFederal and state healthcare legislation has significantly impacted our business, and future legislation and regulations are likely to affect us.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues directly or indirectly from government-sponsored programs, principally the federal Medicare program and to a lesser extent state Medicaid programs. As part of ongoing operations, Omnicare and our customers are subject to legislative and regulatory changes impacting operations and the level of reimbursement received from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. See \u201cGovernment Regulation\u201d above in Item 1 of this Annual Report, which is incorporated by reference herein.\nIn order to limit the growth of healthcare costs, we anticipate that federal and state governments will continue to review and assess alternate healthcare delivery systems, payment methodologies and operational requirements for healthcare providers, including long-term care facilities and pharmacies. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the financial impact on our business of the ACA, or future healthcare initiatives, if any, regarding the cost of healthcare, managed care, universal healthcare coverage, and other healthcare issues. We receive discounts, rebates and other price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers pursuant to contracts for the purchase of their products. There can be no assurance that any changes in legislation or regulations, or the interpretation or application of current law, that would eliminate or significantly reduce the discounts, rebates and other price\nconcessions that we receive from manufacturers or that would otherwise impact payment available for drugs under federal or state healthcare programs will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nOver the long term, funding for federal and state healthcare programs may be impacted by the aging of the population; the growth in enrollees as eligibility is potentially expanded; the escalation in drug costs owing to higher drug utilization among seniors; the impact of the Medicare Part D benefit for seniors; the introduction of new, more efficacious but also more expensive medications; and the long-term financing of the entire Medicare program. Given competing national priorities, we are unable to predict the outcome and impact on our business of any changes in healthcare policy relating to the future funding of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Further, Medicare, Medicaid and/or private payor rates for pharmaceutical supplies and services may not continue to be based on current methodologies or remain comparable to present levels. Any future healthcare legislation or regulation impacting these rates may materially adversely affect our business.\nChanges in industry pricing benchmarks could materially impact our financial performance.\nContracts and fee schedules in the prescription drug industry, including our contracts with various payors and fee schedules under state Medicaid programs, generally use certain published benchmarks, including average wholesale price (\u201cAWP\u201d) and wholesale acquisition cost (\u201cWAC\u201d), to establish pricing for prescription drugs. Most of our contracts and fee schedules utilize the AWP or WAC standard. However, there can be no assurance that payors will continue to utilize AWP, as previously calculated, or that other pricing benchmarks will not be adopted to establish prices within the industry. For example, see \u201cHealthcare Reform and Federal Budget Legislation\u201d under Item 1 of this Annual Report, which is incorporated here by reference, for a description of pricing changes pursuant to the ACA. In addition, CMS has been conducting a national survey of pharmacies to create a national average drug acquisition cost benchmark (\u201cNADAC\u201d), which states may use to set pharmacy payment rates. Effective November 27, 2013, CMS began publishing NADAC prices that are updated on a weekly and monthly basis. CMS also has released for comment draft National Average Retail Price (\u201cNARP\u201d) data, which reflects prices paid to retail community pharmacies for drugs for individuals with Medicaid, cash paying customers, and those with certain third party insurance. Effective July 1, 2013, CMS suspended its NARP survey, pending funding decisions.\nDue to these and other uncertainties, we can give no assurance that the short- or long-term impact of changes to industry pricing benchmarks will not have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Our financial projections, including our earnings guidance for 2015, contemplate what we have estimated to be the most probable impact of changes to industry pricing benchmarks. Actual results may be materially less favorable than those estimated in formulating such projections.\nIf we fail to comply with licensure requirements, fraud and abuse laws, false claims provisions or other applicable laws, we may need to curtail operations, and could be subject to significant penalties.\nOur pharmacy business is subject to extensive and often changing federal, state and local regulations, and our pharmacies are required to be licensed in the states in which they are located or do business. While we regularly monitor and assess the impact on our operations of regulatory activity and we currently have pharmacy licenses for each pharmacy we operate, the failure to obtain or renew any required regulatory approvals or licenses could adversely affect the continued operation of our business. In addition, we are subject to federal and state laws that impose registration, repackaging and labeling requirements on entities that repackage drugs for distribution; state and federal laws regarding the transfer and shipment of pharmaceuticals; and \u201cdrug pedigree\u201d regulations that require prescription drug wholesale distributors to document a history of the transactions in a drug lot\u2019s chain of distribution. These supply chain laws and regulations, which include the DQSA, could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our distribution business. We are also subject to federal and state laws, commonly known as the fraud and abuse laws, that prohibit payments intended to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, a particular provider of items or services. Violation of these laws can result in loss of licensure, civil and criminal penalties, and exclusion from the Medicaid, Medicare and other federal healthcare programs.\nFurther, under the qui tam or \u201cwhistleblower\u201d provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts, private citizens may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of \u201cfalse\u201d claims to federal and/or state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Since the private plaintiff in this type of proceeding is generally entitled to share in any damages a court orders the defendant to pay to federal and state governments under these laws, financial incentives exist for individuals to allege that particular practices or activities constitute a violation of these statutes. A determination that we have violated these laws, or the initiation of a lawsuit alleging a violation of these laws, could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we are subject to various inspections, audits, inquiries, investigations and similar actions by third parties, as well as governmental/regulatory authorities responsible for enforcing the laws and regulations to which we are subject. Federal and state government agencies have increased their focus on and coordination of civil and criminal efforts in the\nhealthcare area, and the ACA and other recent legislation has expanded federal healthcare fraud enforcement authority. The OIG and U.S. Department of Justice have, from time to time, established national enforcement initiatives, targeting all providers of a particular type, that focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of abuse. Further, under the federal False Claims Act and certain state statutes, private parties have the right to bring qui tam, or \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d suits against companies that submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the government. There can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of any such claims, inquiries or investigations, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Moreover, we cannot predict our future costs associated with compliance with such laws.\nOur pharmacies are registered with the appropriate state and federal authorities pursuant to statutes governing the regulation of controlled substances. The Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) increased scrutiny and enforcement of long-term care pharmacy practices under the federal Controlled Substances Act. We believe that this increased scrutiny and, in some cases, stringent interpretation of existing regulations, effectively changed long-standing practices for dispensing controlled substances in the long-term care facility setting. We have been required to modify the controlled substances dispensing procedures at certain of our pharmacies to comply with the regulations as currently interpreted by the DEA. Heightened enforcement of controlled substances regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmacy services, and there can be no assurance that this heightened level of enforcement and DEA or other investigations, or any fines or other penalties resulting therefrom, will not materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nFederal and state laws that protect patient health and other personal information may increase our costs and limit our ability to collect and use that information.\nOmnicare and the healthcare industry generally are required to comply with the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), which mandates, among other things, the adoption of standards to enhance the efficiency and simplify the administration of the healthcare system, as well as to protect the confidentiality of protected health information and electronic protected health information. Many states have similar laws applicable to the Company. In many of our operations, we are a \u201ccovered entity\u201d under HIPAA and, therefore, our operations are required to comply with these standards for which we are subject to significant civil and criminal penalties if we fail to do so. We also provide services to customers that are covered entities, and we are required to provide satisfactory written assurances to those customers through our contractual agreements that we will provide our services in accordance with the requirements of HIPAA. Our failure to comply with these contractual agreements could lead to a loss of customers, contractual liability to our customers or direct action by the federal government, including penalties.\nOn January 25, 2013, the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services published a final rule modifying the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Breach Notification and Enforcement Rules, including revisions made by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d), which, among other things, expanded the privacy and security requirements for business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information for or on behalf of covered entities; increased penalties for noncompliance; and strengthened requirements for reporting breaches of unsecured protected health information. The rule also makes business associates and their subcontractors directly liable for civil monetary penalties for impermissible uses and disclosures of protected health information. The rule required covered entities and business associates to comply, subject to limited exceptions, with the applicable requirements of this final rule by September 23, 2013.\nIn addition to HIPAA, we must adhere to state privacy laws and other state privacy or health information requirements not preempted by HIPAA, including those that provide greater privacy protection for individuals than HIPAA. We believe we fully comply with current HIPAA rules, including the associated changes to HIPAA pursuant to HITECH, and similar state requirements; however, there can be no assurance that the cost of compliance with HIPAA and similar state standards will not increase significantly in the future, which could result in an adverse effect on our operations or profitability, or that of our customers.\nThere are costs and administrative burdens associated with ongoing compliance with information privacy and security laws. Failure to comply carries with it the risk of significant penalties and sanctions. We cannot predict at this time the costs associated with compliance, or the impact of such laws and regulations on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nWe have substantial outstanding debt, including convertible debt, and could incur additional debt in the future. Any failure to meet our debt obligations, including settlement of conversions of our convertible debt securities, would adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2014, our total consolidated long-term debt plus the portion of current debt representing notes and convertible debentures accounted for approximately 43.1% of our total capitalization. Although certain of the instruments governing our current indebtedness contain restrictions on our incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to qualifications and\nexceptions and, under certain circumstances, we could incur substantial additional indebtedness, including in connection with potential acquisition transactions. Additionally, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute debt under the governing documents.\nThe degree to which we are leveraged could have adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022\na substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be required to service interest and principal payments on our debt and may not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions, dividends or general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing in the future may be impaired;\n\u2022\nwe may be more highly leveraged than our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry may be limited; and\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business, our industry or the economy in general.\nSeveral series of our outstanding notes and debentures (collectively, the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d) are convertible into cash and/or shares of our common stock under specified circumstances, including if the closing price of our common stock is more than 130% of the conversion price for such series of Convertible Notes during the applicable measurement period. In general, upon conversion, we will pay cash for the principal amount of the Convertible Notes and shares of common stock for the remainder, if any, based on a daily conversion value during the applicable cash settlement averaging period, provided that we will pay cash in lieu of any fractional shares. Payment occurs at the end of the applicable settlement period, which is generally 30 days after we receive a holder\u2019s notice of conversion. For additional details on the conversion features of the Convertible Notes, see \u201cNote 11 - Debt\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes convertible at any given time is subject to change depending on factors such as the price of our common stock during the applicable measurement period. As of December 31, 2014, approximately $387 million in aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes was convertible, including our 3.75% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2025 (the \u201c2025 Notes\u201d) and our 4.00% Junior Subordinated Convertible Debentures due 2033 (the \u201c2033 Debentures\u201d). Additionally, holders of approximately $186 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.25% Convertible Senior Debentures due 2035 (the \u201cInitial 2035 Debentures\u201d) have the right to require us to repurchase their Initial 2035 Debentures on December 15, 2015 and, therefore, the Initial 2035 Debentures are classified as current debt as of December 31, 2014. We cannot predict the aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes that will be convertible at any given time or how many, if any, holders of such Convertible Notes will present their Convertible Notes for conversion or how many, if any, holders of the Initial 2035 Debentures will require us to repurchase their Initial 2035 Debentures or the impact of any such conversions or repurchases on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows.\nOur ability to make payments on, repurchase or refinance our debt and to satisfy conversions of our Convertible Notes will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, business, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt, satisfy conversions of our Convertible Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity. There can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our debt, including our credit facility, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nWe are subject to risks relating to acquisitions we may consummate.\nFrom time to time, we may pursue and consummate acquisitions as a component of our strategy. Acquisitions involve inherent uncertainties, including our ability to consummate proposed acquisitions on favorable terms or at all, the effect on acquired businesses of integration into a larger organization, and the availability of management resources to oversee the operations of these businesses. Even though an acquired business may have experienced positive financial performance as an independent company prior to an acquisition, we cannot be sure that the business will continue to perform positively after an acquisition.\nWe also may acquire businesses with unknown or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and regulations, and tax contingencies. We have policies and procedures to conduct reviews of potential acquisitions for compliance with healthcare laws and to adapt the acquired businesses to our standards and applicable laws. We also generally seek indemnification from sellers covering these matters. We may, however, incur material liabilities for past activities of acquired businesses.\nWe cannot be sure of the successful completion or integration of any acquisition, or that an acquisition will not have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. We also may not realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of any acquisition.\nCompliance with our Corporate Integrity Agreement imposes significant costs on our business, and our failure to comply would result in penalties or other adverse consequences.\nIn 2009, we entered into an amended and restated Corporate Integrity Agreement (\u201cCIA\u201d) with the OIG, which requires, among other things, that we maintain and augment our compliance program in accordance with the terms of the CIA. The CIA also requires that we, among other things, (i) create procedures designed to ensure that each existing, new or renewed arrangement with any actual or potential source of healthcare business or referrals to Omnicare or any actual or potential recipient of healthcare business or referrals from Omnicare does not violate the Anti-Kickback Statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(b), or related regulations, directives and guidance, including creating and maintaining a database of such arrangements; (ii) retain an independent review organization to review our compliance with the terms of the CIA and report to the OIG regarding that compliance; and (iii) provide training for certain employees as to our obligations under the CIA. The CIA continues the requirements of our prior corporate integrity agreement to create and maintain procedures designed to ensure that all therapeutic interchange programs are developed and implemented by Omnicare consistent with the CIA and federal and state laws for obtaining prior authorization from the prescriber before making a therapeutic interchange of a drug, and to maintain procedures for the accurate preparation and submission of claims for federal healthcare program beneficiaries, including beneficiaries in hospice programs. The requirements of the CIA have resulted in increased costs to maintain our compliance program and greater scrutiny by federal regulatory authorities. Violations of the CIA could subject the Company to significant monetary penalties or other adverse consequences. Consistent with the CIA, we review our customer contracts for compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nWe operate in highly competitive businesses.\nThe long-term care pharmacy business is highly regionalized and, within a given geographic region of operations, highly competitive. Our largest competitor is PharMerica Corporation. In the geographic regions we serve, we also compete with numerous local and regional institutional pharmacies, pharmacies owned by long-term care facilities and local retail pharmacies. While we compete on the basis of quality, price, terms and overall cost-effectiveness, along with the clinical expertise, breadth of services, pharmaceutical technology and professional support we offer, competitive pressures may adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.\nOur SCG business competes throughout the United States with drug wholesalers and pharmaceutical benefit management companies. While we compete on the basis of quality and overall cost effectiveness, along with the breadth of services and professional support we offer, competitive pressures may adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.\nFactors outside of our control could require us to record an asset impairment of goodwill.\nWe are required to analyze goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment. Factors out of our control, including, but not limited to, the economic environment, our market capitalization, and anticipated cash flows could require us to record an impairment charge for goodwill. The accounting guidance establishes a method of testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if an event occurs that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $4 billion of goodwill, which represented 66.5% of our total assets. If we determine that an impairment exists, we will be required to record a non-cash asset impairment charge, which could be significant. For additional information regarding our goodwill, see \u201cNote 7 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and \u201cCritical Accounting Policies - Goodwill\u201d at Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report.\nCybersecurity attacks or other data security incidents could disrupt our operations and expose us to regulatory fines or penalties, liability or reputational damage.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we process, store and transmit data, which may include sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties. Although we have information technology security systems, a successful cybersecurity attack or other data security incident could result in the misappropriation of confidential or personal information, create system interruptions, or deploy malicious software that attacks our systems. Such an attack or incident could result in business interruptions from the disruption of our information technology systems or negative publicity resulting in reputational damage with our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. In addition, the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information could expose us or other third-parties to regulatory fines or penalties, litigation and potential liability, or otherwise harm our business.\nFuture projects related to our information technology systems may result in unexpected costs or business interruptions.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, management completed an assessment of our ongoing project to replace our pharmacy dispensing systems. As a result of the assessment, management decided to abandon the project due to significant costs required to complete the implementation. In connection with this decision, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $60 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to purchased software that will not be used in the future and consulting costs associated with the design and implementation which were previously recorded as property plant and equipment.\nAs we pursue other projects in the future, including the expansion of our existing systems or the design and implementation of new systems, the projects may result in additional costs, business interruptions or the diversion of management\u2019s time and attention away from our operations and strategy. If we do not pursue future projects, we may be hindered in our ability to improve existing operations, support future growth and take advantage of new applications and technologies.", "PERMNO": 63714, "SIC": 5912, "TIC": "OCR"}
