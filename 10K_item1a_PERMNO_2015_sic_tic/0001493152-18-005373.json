RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business as they may have a significant impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance should not be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRelating to Our Business\nOur Revenue Growth Depends on Consumers\u2019 Willingness to Adopt Electric Vehicles.\nOur growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of electric vehicles (\u201cEV\u201d), and we are subject to a risk of any reduced demand for EVs. If the market for EVs does not gain broad market acceptance or develops more slowly than we expect, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be harmed. The market for alternative fuel vehicles is relatively new, rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing technologies, price competition, additional competitors, evolving government regulation and industry standards, frequent new vehicle announcements, long development cycles for EV original equipment manufacturers, and changing consumer demands and behaviors. Factors that may influence the purchase and use of alternative fuel vehicles, and specifically EVs, include:\n\u25cf perceptions about EV quality, safety (in particular with respect to lithium-ion battery packs), design, performance and cost, especially if adverse events or accidents occur that are linked to the quality or safety of EVs;\n\u25cf the limited range over which EVs may be driven on a single battery charge and concerns about running out of power while in use;\n\u25cf improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine;\n\u25cf consumers\u2019 desire and ability to purchase a luxury automobile or one that is perceived as exclusive;\n\u25cf the environmental consciousness of consumers;\n\u25cf volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline;\n\u25cf consumers\u2019 perceptions of the dependency of the U.S. on oil from unstable or hostile countries and the impact of international conflicts;\n\u25cf government regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy;\n\u25cf access to charging stations, standardization of EV charging systems and consumers\u2019 perceptions about convenience and cost to charge an EV; and\n\u25cf the availability of tax and other governmental incentives to purchase and operate EVs or future regulation requiring increased use of nonpolluting vehicles\nThe influence of any of the factors described above may negatively impact the widespread consumer adoption of EVs, which would materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nChanges to the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards May Impact the Electric Vehicle Market and Affect our Business and Results of Operations.\nAs regulatory initiatives have required an increase in the consumption of renewable transportation fuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, consumer acceptance of electric and other alternative vehicles is increasing. To meet higher fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emission standards for passenger vehicles, automobile manufacturers are increasingly using technologies, such as turbocharging, direct injection and higher compression ratios, that require high octane gasoline. If fuel efficiency of vehicles continues to rise, and affordability of vehicles using renewable transportation fuels increases, the demand for electric and high energy vehicles could diminish. If consumers no longer purchase electric vehicles, it would materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nComputer Malware, Viruses, Hacking, Phishing Attacks and Spamming Could Harm Our Business and Results of Operations.\nComputer malware, viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions could lead to interruption and delays in our services and operations and loss, misuse or theft of data. Computer malware, viruses, computer hacking and phishing attacks against online networking platforms have become more prevalent and may occur on our systems in the future.\nAny attempts by hackers to disrupt our website service or our internal systems, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation or brand. Our network security business disruption insurance may not be sufficient to cover significant expenses and losses related to direct attacks on our website or internal systems. Efforts to prevent hackers from entering our computer systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of our services. Though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our products and services and technical infrastructure may harm our reputation, brand and our ability to attract customers. Any significant disruption to our website or internal computer systems could result in a loss of customers and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have previously experienced, and may in the future experience, service disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, third-party service providers, human or software errors and capacity constraints. If our mobile application is unavailable when customers attempt to access it or it does not load as quickly as they expect, customers may seek other services.\nOur platform functions on software that is highly technical and complex and may now or in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been deployed. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered in our code after deployment, inability to identify the cause or causes of performance problems within an acceptable period of time or difficultly maintaining and improving the performance of our platform, particularly during peak usage times, could result in damage to our reputation or brand, loss of revenues, or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve the availability of our platform and to enable rapid releases of new features and products. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and operating results may be harmed.\nWe have a disaster recovery program to transition our operating platform and data to a failover location in the event of a catastrophe and have tested this capability under controlled circumstances, however, there are several factors ranging from human error to data corruption that could materially lengthen the time our platform is partially or fully unavailable to our user base as a result of the transition. If our platform is unavailable for a significant period of time as a result of such a transition, especially during peak periods, we could suffer damage to our reputation or brand, or loss of revenues any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nGrowing Our Customer Base Depends Upon the Effective Operation of Our Mobile Applications with Mobile Operating Systems, Networks and Standards That We Do Not Control.\nWe are dependent on the interoperability of our mobile applications with popular mobile operating systems that we do not control, such as Google\u2019s Android and iOS, and any changes in such systems that degrade our products\u2019 functionality or give preferential treatment to competitive products could adversely affect the usage of our applications on mobile devices. Additionally, in order to deliver high quality mobile products, it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks and standards that we do not control. We may not be successful in developing relationships with key participants in the mobile industry or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, systems, networks or standards.\nWe Need Additional Capital to Fund Our Growing Operations and Cannot Assure You That We Will Be Able to Obtain Sufficient Capital on Reasonable Terms or at All, and We May Be Faced to Limit the Scope of Our Operations.\nWe need additional capital to fund our growing operations and if adequate additional financing is not available on reasonable terms or available at all, we may not be able to undertake expansion or continue our marketing efforts and we would have to modify our business plans accordingly. The extent of our capital needs will depend on numerous factors, including (i) our profitability; (ii) the release of competitive products and/or services by our competition; (iii) the level of our investment in research and development; (iv) the amount of our capital expenditures, including acquisitions; and (v) our growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain capital in the future to meet our needs.\nEven if we do find a source of additional capital, we may not be able to negotiate terms and conditions for receiving the additional capital that are acceptable to us. Any future capital investments could dilute or otherwise materially and adversely affect the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders. In addition, new equity or convertible debt securities issued by us to obtain financing could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our Common Stock. We cannot give you any assurance that any additional financing will be available to us, or if available, will be on terms favorable to us.\nWe Have a History of Significant Losses, and If We Do Not Achieve and Sustain Profitability, Our Financial Condition Could Suffer.\nWe have experienced significant net losses, and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We incurred net losses of approximately $75.4 million and approximately $7.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and as of December 31, 2017, our accumulated deficit was approximately $156.4 million.\nThe net loss was primarily due to an increase in other expenses of approximately $67.5 million from approximately $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to approximately $68.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the non-cash change in fair value of warrant liabilities of approximately $44.7 million, which was primarily attributable to the quantity of warrants held by our Executive Chairman not being subject to our Reverse Stock Split, which, as a result of the Reverse Stock Split, caused them to increase in value.\nOn December 6, 2017, the Company and Mr. Farkas signed a letter agreement, pursuant to which, Mr. Farkas, on behalf of FGI, agreed that upon the closing of a registered offering of the Company\u2019s securities combined with a listing of the Common Stock on a national securities exchange, FGI would cancel 2,930,596 of its shares of Common Stock (of the 2,990,404 received). The Public Offering closed on February 16, 2018. On April 16, 2018, Mr. Farkas cancelled the 2,930,596 shares of common stock.\nIf our revenue grows more slowly than we anticipate, or if our operating expenses are higher than we expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability and our financial condition could suffer. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Whether we can achieve cash flow levels sufficient to support our operations cannot be accurately predicted. Unless such cash flow levels are achieved, we may need to borrow additional funds or sell debt or equity securities, or some combination thereof, to provide funding for our operations. Such additional funding may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nWe May Not Have The Liquidity to Support Our Future Operations and Capital Requirements.\nWhether we can achieve cash flow levels sufficient to support our operations cannot be accurately predicted. Unless such cash flow levels are achieved, in addition to the proceeds from the Public Offering, we may need to borrow additional funds or sell debt or equity securities, or some combination thereof, to provide funding for our operations. Such additional funding may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available when needed, our financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected and we may not be able to operate our business without significant changes in our operations, or at all.\nWe Have Failed to Pay Certain State and Federal Taxes and May be Subject to Penalties as a Result.\nWe are delinquent in filing and, in certain instances, paying sales taxes collected from customers in specific states that impose a tax on sales of our products. We have accrued an approximate $178,000 and $218,000 liability as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, related to this matter. In addition, the Company is currently delinquent in remitting approximately $632,000 and $244,000 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, of federal and state payroll taxes withheld from employees. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company sent two letters to the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) notifying the IRS of its intention to resolve the delinquent taxes upon the receipt of additional working capital. Additionally, on March 27, 2018, the Company has submitted its Forms 940 and 941 for the year ended December 31, 2017 with the IRS. The Company has made continued IRS payroll tax payments starting from the payroll period ending on October 31, 2017 to date, and expects to continue to make regular payments on an on-going basis moving forward. Through the date of filing, the Company is currently seeking settlement with the appropriate taxing authorities for past due amounts.\nAlthough Our Shares and Warrants are Currently Listed on NASDAQ, We Can Provide No Assurance That Our Common Stock and Warrants Will Continue to Meet NASDAQ Listing Requirements. If We Fail to Comply With The Continuing Listing Standards of NASDAQ, Our Securities Could Be Delisted.\nOur Common Stock and warrants are currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) under the symbols \u201cBLNK\u201d and \u201cBLNKW\u201d, respectively. If, however, we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of NASDAQ, such as the corporate governance requirements, stockholder equity requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, NASDAQ may take steps to delist our Common Stock and warrants. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our Common Stock and warrants and would impair your ability to sell or purchase Common Stock and warrants underlying the units when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we can provide no assurance that any action taken by us to restore compliance with listing requirements would allow our Common Stock and warrants to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our Common Stock and warrants, prevent our Common Stock from dropping below the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements.\nIf We Are Unable to Keep Up With Advances in EV Technology, We May Suffer a Decline in Our Competitive Position.\nThe EV industry is characterized by rapid technological change. If we are unable to keep up with changes in EV technology, our competitive position may deteriorate which would materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. As technologies change, we plan to upgrade or adapt our EV charging stations and Blink Network software in order to continue to provide EV charging services with the latest technology. However, due to our limited cash resources, our efforts to do so may be limited. For example, the EV charging network that we acquired from ECOtality was originally funded, in part, by the U.S. Department of Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d), which funding is no longer available to us. As a result, we may be unable to grow, maintain and enhance the network of charging stations that we acquired from ECOtality at the same rate and scale as ECOtality did prior to the acquisition or at levels comparable our current competitors. Any failure of our charging stations to compete effectively with other manufacturers\u2019 charging stations will harm our business, operating results and prospects.\nWe Need to Manage Growth in Operations to Realize Our Growth Potential and Achieve Our Expected Revenues, and Our Failure to Manage Growth Will Cause a Disruption of Our Operations Resulting in the Failure to Generate Revenue and an Impairment of Our Long-Lived Assets.\nIn order to take advantage of the growth that we anticipate in our current and potential markets, we believe that we must expand our marketing operations. This expansion will place a significant strain on our management and our operational, accounting, and information systems. We expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial controls, operating procedures and management information systems. We will also need to effectively train, motivate and manage our employees. Our failure to manage our growth could disrupt our operations and ultimately prevent us from generating the revenues we expect.\nIn order to achieve the above-mentioned targets, the general strategies of our Company are to maintain and search for hard-working employees who have innovative initiatives, as well as to keep a close eye on expansion opportunities through merger and/or acquisition.\nIf Our Estimates or Judgments Relating to Our Critical Accounting Policies Prove to Be Incorrect, Our Financial Condition And Results of Operations Could Be Adversely Affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as discussed under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our consolidated financial statements included herein. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, impairment of goodwill, indefinite-lived and long-lived assets, pension and other post-retirement benefits, product warranty, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, valuation of common stock warrants, and share-based compensation. Our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our Common Stock.\nWe Face Risks Arising From Acquisitions.\nWe may pursue strategic acquisitions in the future. Risks in acquisition transactions include difficulties in the integration of acquired businesses into our operations and control environment, difficulties in assimilating and retaining employees and intermediaries, difficulties in retaining the existing clients of the acquired entities, assumed or unforeseen liabilities that arise in connection with the acquired businesses, the failure of counterparties to satisfy any obligations to indemnify us against liabilities arising from the acquired businesses, and unfavorable market conditions that could negatively impact our growth expectations for the acquired businesses. Fully integrating an acquired company or business into our operations may take a significant amount of time. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with acquisitions and other strategic transactions. These risks may prevent us from realizing the expected benefits from acquisitions and could result in the failure to realize the full economic value of a strategic transaction or the impairment of goodwill and/or intangible assets recognized at the time of an acquisition. These risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time.\nWe Could Be Forced To Pay Damages In Connection With Litigation Involving 350 Green.\nOn September 9, 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit of Chicago, Illinois affirmed the ruling of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in the matter of JNS Power & Control Systems, Inc. (\u201cJNS\u201d) v. 350 Green, LLC in favor of JNS, which affirmed the sale of certain assets by our former subsidiary 350 Green to JNS and the assumption of certain 350 Green liabilities by JNS. On April 7, 2016, JNS amended the complaint to add the Company alleging an unspecified amount of lost revenues from the chargers, among other matters, caused by the defendants. JNS also seeks indemnity for its unspecified costs in connection with enforcing the asset purchase agreement dated April 13, 2013 between 350 Green and JNS in courts in New York and Chicago. As of December 31, 2017, the Company accrued a $750,000 liability in connection with its settlement offer to JNS. On February 2, 2018, the parties entered into an asset purchase agreement whereby the parties agreed to settle the litigation. The Company purchased back the EV chargers it previously sold to JNS for: (a) shares of Common Stock worth $600,000 with a price per share equal to $4.25 (the price per share of the Public Offering); (b) $50,000 cash payment within ten days of the closing of the Public Offering; and (c) $100,000 cash payment within six months following the closing of the Public Offering. The Public Offering closed on February 16, 2018. The Company issued 141,176 shares on March 16, 2018. The Company made the $50,000 payment on March 16, 2018. JNS filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice on March 23, 2018 and the judge granted the motion on March 26, 2018. JNS will file a motion to convert the dismissal without prejudice to dismissal with prejudice within three business days of the $100,000 payment. On March 16, 2018, the Company issued 23,529 shares of Common Stock to JNS to be held in escrow as security for the $100,000 payment. At the time the $100,000 payment is made by the Company, the 23,529 shares currently held in escrow will be cancelled.\nWe Have Limited Insurance Coverage, and Any Claims Beyond Our Insurance Coverage May Result in Our Incurring Substantial Costs and a Diversion of Resources\nWe hold employer\u2019s liability insurance generally covering death or work-related injury of employees. We hold public liability insurance covering certain incidents involving third parties that occur on or in the premises of our Company. We hold directors and officers liability insurance. We do not maintain key-man life insurance on any of our senior management or key personnel, or business interruption insurance. Our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover any claim for product liability, damage to our fixed assets or employee injuries. Any liability or damage to, or caused by, our facilities or our personnel beyond our insurance coverage may result in our incurring substantial costs and a diversion of resources.\nOur Future Success Depends, in Part, on the Performance and Continued Service of Our Officers.\nWe presently depend to a great extent upon the experience, abilities and continued services of our management team, which consists of Mr. Calise (our CEO), Mr. Farkas (our Executive Chairman), and Mr. Feintuch (our Chief Operating Officer). The loss of services of Mr. Calise, Mr. Farkas, or Mr. Feintuch could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation. Failure to maintain our management team could prove disruptive to our daily operations, require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Future Success Depends, in Part, on Our Ability to Attract and Retain Highly Qualified Personnel.\nOur future success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. We are in the process of building our management team. Among other positions, we need to hire a Chief Financial Officer with public company experience. Mr. Calise currently acts as our interim principal financial officer and our interim principal accounting officer. Although we intend to hire a permanent Chief Financial Officer soon, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. Our accounting controls may continue to be deficient unless we obtain the services of an experienced Chief Financial Officer who can help us address material weaknesses. In addition, expansion of our business and the management and operation of our Company will require additional managers and employees with industry experience, and our success will be highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel and other employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified personnel. As our industry continues to evolve, competition for skilled personnel with the requisite experience will be significant. This competition may make it more difficult and expensive to attract, hire and retain qualified managers and employees.\nWe Are in an Intensely Competitive Industry and There Can Be No Assurance That We Will Be Able to Compete with Our Competitors Who May Have Greater Resources.\nWe face strong competition from competitors in the EV charging services industry, including competitors who could duplicate our model. Many of these competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing and development resources and other capabilities than us. In addition, there are very few barriers to entry into the market for our services. There can be no assurance, therefore, that any of our current and future competitors, many of whom may have far greater resources, will not independently develop services that are substantially equivalent or superior to our services. Therefore, an investment in our Company is very risky and speculative due to the competitive environment in which we may operate.\nOur competitors may be able to provide customers with different or greater capabilities or benefits than we can provide in areas such as technical qualifications, past contract performance, geographic presence and price. Furthermore, many of our competitors may be able to utilize substantially greater resources and economies of scale to develop competing products and technologies, divert sales away from us by winning broader contracts or hire away our employees by offering more lucrative compensation packages. In the event that the market for EV charging stations expands, we expect that competition will intensify as additional competitors enter the market and current competitors expand their product lines. In order to secure contracts successfully when competing with larger, well-financed companies, we may be forced to agree to contractual terms that provide for lower aggregate payments to us over the life of the contract, which could adversely affect our margins. Our failure to compete effectively with respect to any of these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results.\nWe Have Experienced Significant Customer Concentration in Recent Periods, And Our Revenue Levels Could Be Adversely Affected if Any Significant Customer Fails To Purchase Products From Us At Anticipated Levels.\nWe are subject to customer concentration risk as a result of our reliance on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues. The relative magnitude and the mix of revenue from our largest customers have varied significantly quarter to quarter. During the year ended December 31, 2017, two customers have accounted for 29% of our revenues varying by period, to our Company. In addition, one customer accounted for 32% of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2017. The loss of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf a Third Party Asserts That We Are Infringing Upon Its Intellectual Property, Whether Successful or Not, It Could Subject Us to Costly and Time-Consuming Litigation or Expensive Licenses, and Our Business May Be Harmed.\nThe EV and EV charging industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets. As we face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. Additionally, although we have acquired from other companies\u2019 proprietary technology covered by patents, we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Intellectual property infringement claims against us could harm our relationships with our customers, may deter future customers from subscribing to our services or could expose us to litigation with respect to these claims. Even if we are not a party to any litigation between a customer and a third party, an adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us to defend our intellectual property in any subsequent litigation in which we are a named party. Any of these results could harm our brand and operating results.\nAny intellectual property rights claim against us or our customers, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management resources and attention. An adverse determination also could prevent us from offering our services to our customers and may require that we procure or develop substitute services that do not infringe.\nWith respect to any intellectual property rights claim against us or our customers, we may have to pay damages or stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights. We may have to seek a license for the technology, which may not be available on reasonable terms, may significantly increase our operating expenses or require us to restrict our business activities in one or more respects. The technology also may not be available for license to us at all. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense.\nThe Success of Our Business Depends in Large Part on Our Ability to Protect and Enforce Our Intellectual Property Rights.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, service mark, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection. We cannot assure you that any patents will issue with respect to our currently pending patent applications, in a manner that gives us the protection that we seek, if at all, or that any future patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Our currently issued patents and any patents that may issue in the future with respect to pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection or they may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. Also, we cannot assure you that any future service mark registrations will be issued with respect to pending or future applications or that any registered service marks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights.\nWe endeavor to enter into agreements with our employees and contractors and agreements with parties with whom we do business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology or the reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our legal actions against these infringers being successful, but we cannot be sure these actions will be successful, even when our rights have been infringed.\nFurthermore, effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services are available over the Internet. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in EV-related industries are uncertain and still evolving.\nChanges to Federal, State or International Laws or Regulations Applicable To Our Company Could Adversely Affect Our Business.\nOur business is subject to a variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations, including those with respect government incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy, electric vehicles and others. These laws and regulations, and the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could change. Any reduction, elimination or discriminatory application of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy changes, fiscal tightening or other reasons may result in diminished revenues from government sources and diminished demand for our products. In addition, new laws or regulations affecting our business could be enacted. These laws and regulations are frequently costly to comply with and may divert a significant portion of management\u2019s attention. If we fail to comply with these applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to significant liabilities which could adversely affect our business.\nThere are many federal, state and international laws that may affect our business, including measures to regulate charging systems, electric vehicles, and others. If we fail to comply with these applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to significant liabilities which could adversely affect our business.\nThere are a number of significant matters under review and discussion with respect to government regulations which may affect the business we intend to enter and/or harm our customers, and thereby adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Ability to Use Our Net Operating Loss Carryforwards May Be Limited.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes of approximately $70.6 million. We generally are able to carry NOLs forward to reduce taxable income in future years. These NOLs may be offset against future taxable income through 2035, if not utilized before that time. However, our ability to utilize the NOLs is subject to the rules of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cSection 382\u201d). Section 382 generally restricts the use of NOLs after an \u201cownership change.\u201d An ownership change generally occurs if, among other things, the stockholders (or specified groups of persons) who own, have owned or are treated as owning, directly or indirectly, five percent or more of our stock increase their aggregate percentage ownership of our stock by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock owned by these persons over a three-year rolling period. In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income that we may offset with NOLs. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable expiration date for the respective NOLs.\nThe rules of Section 382 are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Because of our numerous capital raises, uncertainty exists as to whether we may have undergone an ownership change in the past or will undergo one as a result of the various transactions discussed herein or other future transactions. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that our NOLs will be fully available or utilizable.\nIf We Fail to Establish and Maintain an Effective System of Internal Control, We May Not Be Able to Report Our Financial Results Accurately or Prevent Fraud. Any Inability to Report and File Our Financial Results Accurately and Timely Could Harm Our Reputation and Adversely Impact the Trading Price of Our Common Stock.\nEffective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. As a result, our small size and any current internal control deficiencies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and access to capital. We have also experienced complications reporting as a result of material weaknesses and have at times been delinquent in our reporting obligations. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the most recent period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses described below.\nDuring July 2017, we appointed Robert Schweitzer to our audit committee, who we have determined meets the requirements of a financial expert as defined under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and who has the requisite financial sophistication as defined under the applicable rules and regulations of NASDAQ. Our Board has considered the independence and other characteristics of each of the three members of our audit committee, and our Board believes that each member meets the independence and other requirements of NASDAQ and the SEC. As part of its duties, the audit committee will assist our management in the establishment and monitoring of our internal controls and procedures.\nIn November 2017, the audit committee, as currently comprised, conducted its first review of the interim financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2017. Our management believes that the controls implemented in relation to the audit committee are sufficient to address the material weakness related to the audit committee on a go forward basis and, accordingly, they concluded that, as of December 31, 2017, the material weakness that had existed previously at December 31, 2016 had been remediated.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, within the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) Audit Standard No. 5, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that as of December 31, 2017 our internal controls over financial reporting (\u201cICFR\u201d) were not effective at the reasonable assurance level:\n1. We do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which is applicable to us for the year ended December 31, 2017. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness.\n2. We do not have sufficient resources in our accounting function, which restricts the Company\u2019s ability to gather, analyze and properly review information related to financial reporting in a timely manner. As a result, as of the date of filing, we have not completed our implementation process related to revenue recognition pursuant to ASC 606. In addition, due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness.\n3. We have inadequate controls to ensure that information necessary to properly record transactions is adequately communicated on a timely basis from non-financial personnel to those responsible for financial reporting. Management evaluated the impact of the lack of timely communication between non-financial personnel and financial personnel on our assessment of our reporting controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency represented a material weakness.\n4. Certain control procedures were unable to be verified due to performance of the procedure not being sufficiently documented. As an example, some procedures requiring review of certain reports could not be verified due to there being no written documentation of such review. Management evaluated the impact of its failure to maintain proper documentation of the review process on its assessment of its reporting controls and procedures and has concluded that the controls deficiencies represented a material weakness.\nWe intend to continue to address these weaknesses as resources permit.\nNotwithstanding the assessment that our ICFR was not effective and that there are material weaknesses as identified herein, we believe that our consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the years covered thereby in all material respects.\nRisks Associated with Our Common Stock\nShares of Our Common Stock Which May Be Issued Upon Conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock being Issued in Exchange for Outstanding Indebtedness by JMJ May Dilute the Ownership Interests of Our Stockholders.\nOn October 7, 2016, we executed a Promissory Note in favor of JMJ Financial, a Nevada sole proprietorship owned by Justin Keener (\u201cJMJ\u201d) in the amount up to $3,725,000 bearing interest on the unpaid balance at the rate of six percent. The initial amount borrowed under the Promissory Note was $500,000, with the remaining amounts permitted to be borrowed under the Promissory Note being subject to us achieving certain milestones.\nWe initially issued one warrant to JMJ to purchase a total of 14,286 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price equal to the lesser of: (i) 80% of the Common Stock price of the Public Offering, (ii) $35.00 per share, (iii) 80% of the unit price of the Public Offering (if applicable), (iv) the exercise price of any warrants issued in the Public Offering, or (v) the lowest conversion price, exercise price, or exchange price, of any security issued by us that is outstanding on October 13, 2016.\nThe initial amount borrowed under the Promissory Note was $500,000, with the remaining amounts permitted to be borrowed under the Promissory Note being subject to us achieving certain milestones. With the achievement of certain milestones in November 2016 (the filing with the SEC of a Preliminary Information Statement on Schedule 14C regarding the Reverse Stock Split), an additional advance of $500,000 under the Promissory Note occurred on November 28, 2016. Another warrant to purchase 14,286 shares of our Common Stock was issued as of November 28, 2016. With the achievement of certain milestones in February 2017 (the filing with the SEC of a revised Preliminary Information Statement and a Definitive Information Statement, each on Schedule 14C regarding the Reverse Stock Split), additional advances of $225,100 and $300,000 under the Promissory Note occurred on February 10 and February 27, respectively. Thus, two more warrants to purchase the Company\u2019s Common Stock were issued, one for 6,431 shares and the other for 8,571 shares, respectively.\nAll advances after February 28, 2017 were at the discretion of JMJ without regard to any specific milestones occurring. Additional advances of $250,000 and $30,000 under the Promissory Note occurred on March 14, 2017 and March 24, 2017, respectively, and two more warrants to purchase the Company\u2019s Common Stock were issued, one for 7,143 shares and the other for 857 shares. An additional advance of $400,000 occurred on April 5, 2017 and another warrant to purchase 11,429 shares of our Common Stock was issued on the same date. An additional advance of $295,000 occurred on May 9, 2017 and another warrant to purchase 8,429 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock was issued on the same date. On July 27, 2017, an additional advance of $50,000 was made to the Company and another warrant to purchase 1,429 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock was issued to JMJ. JMJ and the Company entered into a Lockup, Conversion, and Additional Investment Agreement dated October 23, 2017 (the \u201cAdditional Agreement\u201d), however, it became effective upon the document being fully executed on October 24, 2017. In accordance with the terms of the Additional Agreement, on October 24, 2017, JMJ advanced to the Company $949,900 available pursuant to previous agreements with JMJ and another warrant to purchase 27,140 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock was issued to JMJ. As of the closing of the Public Offering, ten (10) warrants to purchase a total of 100,001 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock had been issued to JMJ. The aggregate exercise price was $3,500,000.\nThe Additional Agreement extended the maturity date of the JMJ loans to December 15, 2017. On November 29, 2017, the Company and JMJ entered into the first amendment to the Additional Agreement, extending the maturity date to December 31, 2017. On January 4, 2018, the Company and JMJ entered into the second amendment to the Additional Agreement, extending the maturity date to January 31, 2018. On February 1, 2018, the Company and JMJ entered into the third amendment to the Additional Agreement, extending the maturity date to February 10, 2018. On February 7, 2018, the Company and JMJ entered into the fourth amendment to the Additional Agreement, extending the maturity date to February 15, 2018.\nIn addition, JMJ claimed that the Company would owe JMJ $12 million as a mandatory default amount pursuant to previous agreements with the Company. JMJ, in the Additional Agreement, agreed to allow the Company to have two options for settling a previously issued note (including settling the mandatory default amount for either $1.1 million or $2.1 million), securing a lockup agreement from JMJ, and exchanging previously issued warrants for shares of Common Stock. Each of these options depended upon the Public Offering closing by December 15, 2017 (subsequently extended to February 15, 2018). The option chosen was at the Company\u2019s sole discretion.\n\u201cOrigination Shares\u201d was defined in the purchase agreement with JMJ as the following: on the fifth (5th) trading day after the closing of our public offering we would deliver to JMJ shares of our Common Stock equal to 48% of the consideration paid by JMJ under the Promissory Note divided by the lowest of (i) $35.00 per share, or (ii) the lowest daily closing price of our Common Stock during the ten days prior to delivery of the Origination Shares (subject to adjustment for stock splits), or (iii) 80% of the Common Stock price of this offering, or (iv) 80% of the unit price of this offering (if applicable), or (v) the exercise price of any warrants issued in this offering. The number of shares to be issued was to be determined based on the offering price of the public offering.\nThe first option was that the Company, upon the closing of the Public Offering: (a) would pay $2.0 million in cash to JMJ; and (b) would issue shares of Common Stock to JMJ with a value of $9,005,000 (including the Origination Shares). The second option was that the Company, upon the closing of the Public Offering, would not pay any cash to JMJ and would issue shares of Common Stock to JMJ with a value of $12,005,000 (including the Origination Shares).\nUpon the closing of the Public Offering (February 16, 2018), the Company chose the second option and did not pay any cash to JMJ. Although the Public Offering closed one day after the February 15, 2018 Maturity Date, JMJ accepted payment on February 16, 2018 and did not declare a default.\nIn each case, the Company was to issue such number of duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock equal to the amount in question divided by the lowest of (i) $35.00 per share, or (ii) the lowest daily closing price of the Common Stock during the ten days prior to delivery of shares (subject to adjustment for stock splits), or (iii) 80% of the Common Stock price of the Public Offering, or (iv) 80% of the unit price of the Public Offering (if applicable), or (v) the exercise price of any warrants issued in the Public Offering.\nPrior to the Company choosing the option at the closing (with the first option including some cash and the second option not including any cash), JMJ could elect to receive some or all of the share consideration (to be issued pursuant to either option) in the form of convertible preferred stock. On January 29, 2018, JMJ made the election to receive all of the share consideration in the form of shares of convertible preferred stock.\nPursuant to the second option and to the election by JMJ to receive convertible preferred stock instead of common stock as permitted by the Additional Agreement, the Company, on February 16, 2018 issued to JMJ shares of Series D Preferred Stock convertible into 3,847,756 shares of Common Stock, to reflect the full payment of all dollar amounts and share amounts owed in connection with the JMJ Financing. Because the Series D Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of our Common Stock, upon JMJ\u2019s conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock into shares of our Common Stock, holders of our Common Stock will experience dilution.\nWe refer herein to these transactions with JMJ as the \u201cJMJ Financing\u201d.\nSeparately from and unrelated to the JMJ Financing, JMJ lent $250,000 to the Company on January 22, 2018. We agreed with JMJ to issue units of unregistered shares of Common Stock and warrants as repayment of this $250,000 advance at the closing of the Public Offering (with each unit consisting of one share of Common Stock and two warrants each to purchase one share of Common Stock). On March 16, 2018, the Company issued 73,529 shares of Common Stock to JMJ and on April 9 the Company issued 147,058 warrants to JMJ.\nOur Shares of Common Stock Are Very Thinly Traded, and the Price May Not Reflect Our Value and There Can Be No Assurance That There Will Be an Active Market for Our Shares of Common Stock Either Now or in the Future.\nOur shares of Common Stock are very thinly traded, and the price, if traded, may not reflect our value. There can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of Common Stock either now or in the future. The market liquidity will be dependent on the perception of our operating business and any steps that our management might take to increase awareness of our Company with investors. There can be no assurance given that there will be any awareness generated. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business. If a more active market should develop, the price may be highly volatile. Because there may be a low price for our shares of Common Stock, many brokerage firms may not be willing to effect transactions in the securities. Even if an investor finds a broker willing to effect a transaction in the shares of our Common Stock, the combination of brokerage commissions, transfer fees, taxes, if any, and any other selling costs may exceed the selling price. Further, many lending institutions will not permit the use of such shares of Common Stock as collateral for loans.\nWe Have a Significant Number of Shares of Our Common Stock Issuable Upon Conversion of Certain Outstanding Options, Warrants, and Convertible Preferred Stock, and The Issuance of Such Shares Upon Exercise or Conversion Will Have a Significant Dilutive Impact On Our Stockholders. Sales of a Substantial Number of Shares of Our Common Stock Following The Expiration of Lock-Ups May Adversely Affect the Market Price of Our Common Stock and the Issuance of Additional Shares Will Dilute All Other Stockholders.\nAs of April 16, 2018, there are 11,056,480 warrants and 74,968 options outstanding.\nAs of April 16, 2018, there are 3,847,756 shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of our Series D Preferred Stock.\nIn addition, our articles of incorporation, as amended, permits the issuance of up to approximately 463 million additional shares of Common Stock. Thus, we have the ability to issue substantial amounts of Common Stock in the future, which would dilute the percentage ownership held by stockholders.\nWe and our officers, directors and certain stockholders have agreed, subject to customary exceptions, not to, without the prior written consent of Joseph Gunnar & Co., LLC, the representative of the underwriters of the Public Offering, during the period ending 180 days from February 16, 2018 (the date of the closing of the Public Offering) in the case of us and our directors and officers and 90 days or 270 days from February 16, 2018 in the case of certain stockholders, directly or indirectly, offer to sell, sell, pledge or otherwise transfer or dispose of any of shares of our Common Stock, enter into any swap or other derivatives transaction that transfers to another any of the economic benefits or risks of ownership of shares of our Common Stock, make any demand for or exercise any right or cause to be filed a registration statement, including any amendments thereto, with respect to the registration of any shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock or any other securities of our Company or publicly disclose the intention to do any of the foregoing.\nAfter the lock-up agreements with certain stockholders pertaining to the Public Offering expire: (i) 270 days from February 16, 2018 unless waived earlier by the representative, up to 8,367,879 of the shares that had been locked up; and (ii) 90 days from February 16, 2018 unless waived earlier by the representative, up 338,969 of the shares that had been locked up, will be eligible for future sale in the public market. After the lock-up agreements with our directors and officers, Horton Capital, and JMJ expire 180 days from February 16, 2018 unless waived earlier by the representative, up to 7,707,819 of the shares (including shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of our Series D Preferred Stock) (net of any shares also restricted by lock-up agreements with certain stockholders) that had been locked up will be eligible for future sale in the public market. Sales of a significant number of these shares of Common Stock in the public market could reduce the market price of the Common Stock.\nFuture Issuance of Our Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Options and Warrants Could Dilute the Interests of Existing Stockholders.\nWe may issue additional shares of our Common Stock, preferred stock, options and warrants in the future. The issuance of a substantial amount of Common Stock, options and warrants could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our current stockholders. In addition, the sale of a substantial amount of Common Stock or preferred stock in the public market, or the exercise of a substantial number of warrants and options either in the initial issuance or in a subsequent resale by the target company in an acquisition which received such Common Stock as consideration or by investors who acquired such Common Stock in a private placement could have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe Do Not Intend to Pay Dividends for the Foreseeable Future, and You Must Rely on Increases in the Market Prices of Our Common Stock for Returns on Your Investment.\nFor the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Common Stock. Accordingly, investors must be prepared to rely on sales of their Common Stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our Common Stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors the Board deems relevant.\nOur Executive Officers and Directors, Including Our Executive Chairman Mr. Farkas and His Affiliates, Possess Significant Voting Power With Respect to Our Common Stock, Which Will Limit Your Influence on Corporate Matters.\nAs of April 16, 2018, our directors and executive officers collectively beneficially own approximately 43.80% of the shares of our Common Stock on a fully-diluted basis including the beneficial ownership of Mr. Farkas and his affiliates of 39.74% of the shares of our Common Stock on a fully-diluted basis.\nAs a result, our insiders have the ability to significantly influence our management and affairs through the election and removal of our Board and all other matters requiring stockholder approval, including any future merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated voting power could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change-of-control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. Furthermore, this concentrated control will limit the practical effect of your influence over our business and affairs, through any stockholder vote or otherwise. Any of these effects could depress the price of our Common Stock.\nOur Executive Chairman Mr. Farkas Will Be Able To Influence The Outcome of Stockholder Votes. Mr. Farkas\u2019 Interests May Differ From Other Stockholders.\nAs of April 16, 2018, Mr. Farkas and his affiliates beneficially own 39.74% of the shares of our Common Stock on a fully-diluted basis.\nSubject to any fiduciary duties owed to our other stockholders under Nevada law, Mr. Farkas will be able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, and will have some control over our management and policies. Mr. Farkas may have interests that are different from yours. For example, Mr. Farkas may support proposals and actions with which you may disagree. The concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change in control of our Company or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of our Company, which in turn could reduce the price of our stock. In addition, Mr. Farkas could use his voting influence to maintain our existing management and directors in office, delay or prevent changes in control of our Company, or support or reject other management and board proposals that are subject to stockholder approval, such as amendments to our employee stock plans and approvals of significant financing transactions.\nOur Articles of Incorporation Grants Our Board The Power to Issue Additional Shares of Common And Preferred Shares And to Designate Other Classes of Preferred Shares, All Without Stockholder Approval.\nOur authorized capital consists of 540,000,000 shares of capital stock of which 40,000,000 shares are authorized as preferred stock. Our Board, without any action by our stockholders, may designate and issue shares of preferred stock in such series as it deems appropriate and establish the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares, including dividends, liquidation and voting rights, provided it is consistent with Nevada law.\nThe rights of holders of our preferred stock that may be issued could be superior to the rights of holders of our shares of Common Stock. The designation and issuance of shares of capital stock having preferential rights could adversely affect other rights appurtenant to shares of our Common Stock. Furthermore, any issuances of additional stock (common or preferred) will dilute the percentage of ownership interest of then-current holders of our capital stock and may dilute our book value per share.\nCertain Provisions of Our Corporate Governing Documents And Nevada Law Could Discourage, Delay, or Prevent A Merger or Acquisition at a Premium Price.\nCertain provisions of our organizational documents and Nevada law could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company, or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock. For example, our articles of incorporation and bylaws permit us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, up to 40,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and, with respect to each series, to fix the number of shares constituting the series and the designation of the series, the voting powers (if any) of the shares of the series, and the preferences and relative, participating, optional, and other special rights, if any, and any qualifications, limitations, or restrictions of the shares of the series.\nOur Stock Price Could Fall and We Could Be Delisted in Which Case Broker-Dealers May Be Discouraged from Effecting Transactions in Shares of Our Common Stock Because They May Be Considered Penny Stocks and Thus Be Subject to the Penny Stock Rules.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) has adopted a number of rules to regulate \u201cpenny stocks\u201d that restricts transactions involving stock which is deemed to be penny stock. Such rules include Rules 3a51-1, 15g-1, 15g-2, 15g-3, 15g-4, 15g-5, 15g-6, 15g-7, and 15g-9 under the Exchange Act. These rules may have the effect of reducing the liquidity of penny stocks. \u201cPenny stocks\u201d generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 per share (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market. Our securities have in the past constituted, and may again in the future constitute, \u201cpenny stock\u201d within the meaning of the rules. The additional sales practice and disclosure requirements imposed upon U.S. broker-dealers may discourage such broker-dealers from effecting transactions in shares of our Common Stock, which could severely limit the market liquidity of such shares and impede their sale in the secondary market.\nA U.S. broker-dealer selling penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or \u201caccredited investor\u201d (generally, an individual with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or an annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with his or her spouse) must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must receive the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. In addition, the \u201cpenny stock\u201d regulations require the U.S. broker-dealer to deliver, prior to any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock\u201d, a disclosure schedule prepared in accordance with SEC standards relating to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. A U.S. broker-dealer is also required to disclose commissions payable to the U.S. broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, a U.S. broker-dealer is required to submit monthly statements disclosing recent price information with respect to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d held in a customer\u2019s account and information with respect to the limited market in \u201cpenny stocks\u201d.\nStockholders should be aware that, according to the SEC, the market for \u201cpenny stocks\u201d has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (i) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (ii) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (iii) \u201cboiler room\u201d practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (iv) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (v) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, resulting in investor losses. Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities.\nWe May Need Additional Capital, and the Sale of Additional Shares or Equity or Debt Securities Could Result in Additional Dilution to Our Stockholders.\nWe believe that our existing cash is sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months. We may, however, require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments. If these resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain one or more credit facilities. The sale of additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a Common Stock holder. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. It is uncertain whether financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nIf we raise additional funds through government grants, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue stream or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nIf Securities or Industry Analysts Do Not Publish Research or Reports About Our Business, or Publish Inaccurate or Unfavorable Research Reports About Our Business, Our Share Price and Trading Volume Could Decline.\nThe trading market for our Common Stock will, to some extent, depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us from time to time should downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our business prospects, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our Company or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nSubstantial Future Sales of Shares of Our Common Stock In The Public Market Could Cause Our Stock Price To Fall.\nStockholders can now use Rule 144 pursuant to the Securities Act to sell shares of our Common Stock. Additional sales of a substantial number of our shares of our Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our Common Stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock in the public market could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline. If there are more shares of Common Stock offered for sale than buyers are willing to purchase, then the market price of our Common Stock may decline to a market price at which buyers are willing to purchase the offered shares of Common Stock and sellers remain willing to sell the shares.", "PERMNO": 17313, "SIC": 7500, "TIC": "BLNK"}
