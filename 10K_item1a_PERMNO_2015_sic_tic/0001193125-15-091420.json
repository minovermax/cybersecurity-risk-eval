{"cik": "1137091", "company": "POWER SOLUTIONS INTERNATIONAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks, including those described below, which in turn may affect the value of our securities. In addition, other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects, perhaps materially. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and actual results and events may differ substantially from those discussed or highlighted in these forward-looking statements. Before making an investment decision with respect to any of our securities, you should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this report. See also \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to our Business and our Industry\nThe market for alternative fuel spark-ignited power systems may not continue to develop according to our expectations and, as a result, our business may not grow as planned and our business plan may be adversely affected.\nOur future growth is dependent upon the market for efficient alternative fuel spark-ignited power systems (including natural gas and propane) expanding as a result of our customers and potential customers substituting alternative fuel power systems for diesel power systems. Part of our business plan is dependent on our market forecasts with respect to this expected substitution trend. However, there can be no assurance that we can accurately predict the potential impact of new diesel emission regulations, which we assume will help drive this trend by increasing the cost and product footprint of diesel power systems, nor can we assure that customers or potential customers would substitute natural gas and propane powered power systems for diesel power systems in response to these regulations. In addition, to the extent that diesel power system manufacturers develop the ability to design and produce emission-compliant diesel power systems that they can sell at a lower price and have smaller product footprints than we currently expect, diesel power systems will be more competitive with\nour alternative fuel power systems, and customers and potential customers may be less likely to substitute alternative fuel power systems for diesel power systems. Furthermore, even if alternative fuel power systems are substituted for diesel power systems, there can be no assurance that our power systems would capture any portion of the potential market increase. If the industrial OEM market generally, or more specifically any of the industrial OEM categories which represent a significant portion of our business or in which we anticipate significant growth opportunities for our power systems, fails to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate, the growth of our business and our business plan could be materially adversely affected.\nOur 8.8 liter engine block is the first engine block manufactured in-house by our company, and may not be successful.\nWe have introduced a newly designed 8.8 liter, fuel flexible engine block that we have internally developed to replace an engine that we previously purchased from a third party engine supplier. This is our first engine produced in-house by us. We may not be successful in obtaining acceptance of this product in the marketplace, particularly given that it is in part the replacement for an engine block produced by a well-known and long-time engine manufacturer. Even if this product is accepted in the marketplace, we do not have sufficient history with this engine to assess whether it will succeed without significant performance issues.\nThe discovery of any significant problems with these engines, or any of the other engines we develop, could result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, potential product liability claims, reputational risk and brand risk. More specifically, sales of our own internally developed engine could lead to significantly higher warranty costs to service this engine if it does not perform to expectations, as we would be unable to rely on a warranty provided by a third-party engine manufacturer. Additionally, any performance issues with our internally developed engine could also result in increased product liability claims, and we would be unable to rely on any indemnification provided by a third-party engine manufacturer. Potential losses could also arise from other unforeseen issues associated with the internal production of our own base engine block. For additional detail regarding the risk of introducing a new product such as our 8.8 liter engine, see \u201c- New products, including new engines we develop, may not achieve widespread adoption.\u201d For additional detail regarding the risk of warranty costs and product liability claims, see \u201c- We could suffer warranty claims that could materially and adversely affect our business\u201d and \u201c- We could become subject to product liability claims.\u201d\nWe may not succeed with the expansion of our product into the on-road market.\nOur current products have historically been sold and used in the off-road industrial markets. We have announced our intention to expand our product line to on-road markets into which we have not previously sold.\nThe costs and regulations involved with certifying an engine for on-road applications may be more than expected, which could affect our ability to successfully expand our product line into these markets. Additionally, the stresses and demands on engines and power systems used for on-road applications could result in unexpected issues. Not only are we attempting to expand into markets into which we have not previously sold, we are attempting to do so using our newly designed and internally developed 8.8 liter engine. This unproven engine for on-road applications (and other additional applications) may not gain acceptance as an alternative to proven engines already used in on-road applications, and our company may not generally gain acceptance as a supplier to on-road markets. For additional detail regarding the risks related to our newly developed 8.8 liter engine, see \u201c- Our 8.8 liter engine block is the first engine block manufactured in-house by our company, and may not be successful.\u201d\nAs we begin to sell into these markets, we may expose ourselves to additional costs associated with on-road engine failures. These costs could be significant, not only if the vehicle into which the engine is installed becomes damaged, but because of the increased potential for injuries or fatalities that could arise from a malfunction or manufacturing defect in an engine used for on-road applications. Finally, we may face significantly increased competition in the on-road markets from competitors with longer operating histories, greater name recognition and greater financial and marketing resources than our current competitors in the off-\nroad industrial markets. For additional detail regarding the competition faced by our company, see \u201c- We currently face, and will continue to face, significant competition, which could result in a decrease in our revenue.\u201d\nWe have expanded our on-road product line by entering a multi-year supply agreement with General Motors for 4.8-liter and 6.0-liter engines. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in expanding our on-road product line which could have an adverse impact on our on-road supply agreement with General Motors.\nNew products, including new engines we develop, may not achieve widespread adoption.\nOur growth may depend on our ability to develop and/or acquire new products, and/or refine our existing products and power system technology, to complement and enhance the breadth of our power system offerings with respect to engine class and the industrial OEM market categories into which we supply our products. We will generally seek to develop or acquire new products, or enhance our existing products and power system technology, if we believe they will provide significant additional revenues and favorable profit margins. However, we cannot know beforehand whether any new or enhanced products will successfully penetrate our target markets. There can be no assurance that newly developed or acquired products will perform as well as we expect, or that such products will gain widespread adoption among our customers.\nAdditionally, there are greater design and operational risks associated with new products. The inability of our suppliers to produce technologically sophisticated components for our new engines and power systems, the discovery of any product or process defects or failures associated with production of any new products and any related product returns could each have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If new products for which we expend significant resources to develop or acquire are not successful, our business could be adversely affected.\nChanges in environmental and regulatory policies could hurt the market for our products.\nOur business is affected by government environmental policies, mandates and regulations around the world, most significantly with respect to emission standards in the United States. Examples of such regulations include those that (1) restrict the sale of power systems that do not meet emission standards, (2) impose penalties on sellers of non-compliant power systems, and (3) require the use of more expensive ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel. There can be no assurance that these policies, mandates and regulations will be continued or expanded as assumed in our growth strategy. Incumbent industry participants with a vested interest in gasoline and diesel, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do, may invest significant resources in an effort to influence environmental regulations in ways that delay or repeal requirements for more stringent carbon, particulate matter (a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air that contain a variety of chemical components, such as dust, dirt, soot or smoke) and other emissions.\nWe generally must obtain product certification from both the EPA and CARB to sell our products in the United States. We may attempt to expand sales of our certified power systems to industrial OEMs that sell their products in Europe, which also has stringent emissions requirements. Accordingly, future sales of our product will depend upon their being certified to meet the existing and future air quality and energy standards imposed by the relevant regulatory agencies. While we incur significant research and developments costs to ensure that our products comply with emission standards and meet certification requirements in the regions where our products are sold, we cannot provide assurance that our products will continue to meet these standards. The failure to comply with certification requirements would not only adversely affect future sales but could result in the recall of our products or civil or criminal penalties.\nThe adoption of new, more stringent and burdensome government emission regulations, whether at the foreign, federal, state, or local level, in markets in which we supply our power systems, may require modification of our emission certification and other manufacturing processes for our power systems. Thus, we might incur unanticipated expenses in meeting future compliance requirements, and may be required to increase our research\nand product development expenditures. Increases in such costs and expenses could necessitate increases in the prices we charge our OEM customers for our power systems, which could adversely affect demand for them.\nWe currently face, and will continue to face, significant competition, which could result in a decrease in our revenue.\nThe market for our products and related services is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and sensitive to new product and service introductions and changes in technical requirements. New developments in power system technology may negatively affect the development or sale of some or all of our power systems or make our power systems uncompetitive or obsolete. Other companies, some of which have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and greater financial and marketing resources than us, are currently engaged in the development of products and technologies that are similar to, or may be competitive with, certain of our products and power system technologies. If the markets for our products (including particular industrial OEM market categories) grow as we anticipate, competition may intensify, as existing and new competitors identify opportunities in such markets.\nWe face competition from companies that employ current power system technologies, and may face competition in the future from additional companies as new power system technologies are adopted. Among our competitors are fuel system providers such as Westport Innovations, Inc., Fuel System Solutions and Woodward Governor, Inc., which supply engines and engine system components to the industrial OEM marketplace. Additionally, we may face competition from companies developing technologies such as cleaner diesel engines, bio-diesel, fuel cells, advanced batteries and hybrid battery/internal combustion power systems. We may not be able to incorporate such technologies into our product offerings, or may be required to devote substantial resources to do so. The success of our business depends in large part on our ability to provide single assembly, integrated, comprehensive, technologically sophisticated power systems to our customers. The development or enhancement by our competitors of similar capabilities could adversely affect our business.\nOur industrial OEM customers may not continue to outsource their power system needs.\nThe purchasers of our power systems are industrial OEMs that manufacture industrial equipment. As a result of the significant resources and expertise required to develop and manufacture emission-certified power systems, these customers have historically chosen to outsource production of power systems to us. Our business depends in significant part on our industrial OEMs continuing to outsource design and production of power systems, power system components and subsystems. However, there can be no assurance that our OEM customers will continue to outsource, or outsource as much of, their power system production in the future. Industrial OEMs that otherwise might use our power systems may instead seek to internalize the production of these power systems and related components. Increased levels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers\u2019 business strategies, acquisition by a customer of a power system manufacturer or the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries.\nWe are dependent on certain products and industrial OEM market categories for a significant share of our revenues and profits.\nDuring fiscal 2014, a significant portion of our revenues were derived from sales of our power systems to be incorporated into equipment used in the power generation and forklift market categories, and we anticipate that sales of power systems in these market categories will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. We further believe that our growth may depend in a significant part upon our ability to increase sales of our power systems in the material handling and oil and gas market categories, as well as certain other industrial OEM categories. There can be no assurance that the material handling and oil and gas market categories, or any other industrial market category into which we sell our power systems, will grow as quickly or as significantly as we expect (if at all), or that the current, or any future, demand for our power systems in any of these market categories will not decrease.\nWe are dependent on relationships with our OEM customers and any change in our relationships with any of our key OEM customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nOur power systems are integrated into our OEM customers\u2019 equipment for subsequent sales and distribution to end-users of off-highway industrial equipment. Three of our customers represented more than 10% of our sales in each of the last three fiscal years. We do not currently have formal, written agreements with certain of these customers or some of our other largest customers. There can be no assurance that our current material customers, or industrial OEMs in general, will continue manufacturing equipment that uses our power systems or, if they do manufacture such equipment, that the end-users of our OEM customers will choose to purchase products into which our power systems are incorporated. Any integration, design, manufacturing or marketing problems encountered by our OEM customers could adversely affect the demand for our power systems and the ability of our OEM customers to timely pay us amounts due for our products and services. Any change in our relationships with any of our key OEM customers, whether as a result of economic or competitive pressures or otherwise, including any decision by our OEM customers to reduce their commitments to purchase our power systems in favor of competing products, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIn addition, we may be subject to disputes arising from agreements and other arrangements with our OEM customers. Disputes with our OEM customers could lead to termination of arrangements with our OEM customers and delays in collaborative development or commercialization of power systems that we design for, and supply to, these customers. Moreover, disagreements may arise with our OEM customers over rights to proprietary technology and other intellectual property incorporated in our power systems and our customers\u2019 products into which our power systems are integrated. Significant disagreements with our OEM customers could result in costly and time-consuming litigation. Any such conflicts with our OEM customers could negatively impact our relationships, reduce the number of power systems which we supply, and negatively impact our ability to obtain future business, in each case with these and other OEM customers.\nWe are dependent on relationships with our material suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these key suppliers, or the failure to find replacement suppliers or manufacturers in a timely manner, could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to our internally produced engines, we source engines from third party suppliers. We have established relationships with these third party engine suppliers and other suppliers from which we source our components for our power systems. We are substantially dependent on our three key engine suppliers, General Motors, Perkins/Caterpillar and Doosan. Sales of our power systems incorporating engines from General Motors, Perkins/Caterpillar and Doosan represented approximately 38%, 8% and 36% of our total sales for fiscal 2014, respectively, and represented approximately 50%, 10% and 25% of our total sales for fiscal 2013, respectively. If any of these three engine suppliers were to fail to provide engines in a timely manner or to supply engines that meet our quality, quantity or cost requirements, or were to discontinue manufacturing any engines we source from them or providing any such engines to us, and we were unable to obtain substitute sources in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us, our ability to manufacture our products could be materially adversely affected. In addition, we currently source other important components used in our power systems, such as catalysts, engine controllers, fuel mixers, wiring harnesses, engine sensors and intake manifolds, from a limited number of suppliers. Much of the technology incorporated into these components that we source from a limited number of suppliers is technologically sophisticated, and we do not believe that our competitors have access to some of this sophisticated technology. Our business could be harmed by adverse changes in our relationships with our non-engine component suppliers, or if our competitors gain access to the technology. Further, if our suppliers are unable to provide components to us in a timely manner, or are unable to meet our quality, quantity or cost requirements, we may not in all cases be able to promptly obtain substitute sources. Any extended delay in receiving engines or other critical components could impair our ability to deliver products to our OEM customers.\nWe do not have formal, written agreements with many of our component suppliers. Most of our non-engine component supply agreements do not extend past the end of 2015. In any event, a component supplier may fail to provide components on a timely basis, or fail to meet our specifications or other requirements for a component, regardless of whether we have a written contract with such supplier.\nWe derive a substantial majority of our diesel power systems revenues from our relationships with Perkins and Caterpillar.\nWe derive a significant portion of our diesel power systems business from our distribution agreement with Perkins, our packaging and distribution agreements with Caterpillar engine dealers and our association with Caterpillar. Our business with Perkins and Caterpillar represented approximately 10% and 13% of our revenues in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. Any material change in our relationships with Perkins and Caterpillar, including the termination of our distribution agreement with Perkins, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nThe quality and performance of our power systems are, in part, dependent on the quality of their component parts that we obtain from various suppliers, which makes us susceptible to performance issues that could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation and financial results.\nOur power systems are sophisticated and complex, and the success of our power systems is dependent, in part, upon the quality and performance of key components, such as engines, fuel systems, generators, breakers, and complex electrical components and associated software. There can be no assurance that the power system parts and components will not have performance issues from time to time, and the warranties provided by our suppliers may not always cover the potential performance issues. We may face disputes with our suppliers with respect to those performance issues and their warranty obligations, and our customers could claim damages as a result of such performance issues.\nIf any of the component parts we obtain from our suppliers are defective, we may incur liabilities for warranty claims. The supplier in any such case may not fully compensate us for any such liabilities. We may also be responsible for obtaining replacement parts and incur liability related thereto.\nWe maintain a significant investment in inventory, and a decline in our customers\u2019 purchases could lead to a decline in our sales and profitability and cause us to accumulate excess inventory.\nWe cannot always predict the timing, frequency or size of the future orders of our OEM customers. Our ability to accurately forecast our sales is further complicated by the continuing global economic uncertainty. We maintain significant inventories in an effort to ensure that our OEM customers have a reliable source of supply. If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our customers and accurately forecast our customer demands, our customers may not continue to place orders with us, and we may accumulate significant inventories of products that we will be unable to sell or return to our suppliers. This may result in a significant decline in the value of our inventory and a decrease in our future gross profit.\nChanges in our product mix could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe margins on our revenues from some of our product and service offerings are higher than the margins on some of our other product and service offerings. In particular, the margins vary between sales of our power systems as compared to sales of our aftermarket parts and components. A decrease in demand for our higher margin products and service offerings, such as our heavy duty power systems, could have a negative impact on our profitability. Our margins can also fluctuate based upon competition, alternative products and services, operating costs and contractual factors. In addition, we may not be able to accurately estimate the margins of some of our new and developing products and services due to our limited operating history with sales of these products. Our new products and services may have lower margins than our current products and services.\nOur financial position, results of operations and cash flows have been, and may in the future be, negatively impacted by challenging global economic conditions.\nChallenging global economic conditions, which can have a particularly severe impact on industrial markets, have had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our business. More specifically, such conditions resulted in significantly reduced demand in 2009 for our power systems and other products from our industrial OEM customers, as those customers faced sharp declines in market demand for their products into which our power systems are incorporated. Our net sales decreased from 2008 to 2009, primarily due to lower power system shipment volumes and aftermarket parts sales resulting from this reduced demand. This sales decrease was reflected across our base of customers in all of the OEM categories in which our power systems are used. Difficult market conditions can also cause us to experience pricing pressure, negatively impacting our margins.\nFuture economic downturns may materially impact our OEM customers, as well as suppliers and other parties with which we do business. Economic conditions that adversely affect our customers may cause them to terminate existing supply agreements or to reduce the volume of power systems they purchase from us in the future. In the case of another economic downturn, we may have significant receivables owing from customers that face liquidity issues. Failure to collect a significant portion of amounts due on those receivables could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Similarly, with adverse market conditions, our key suppliers from which we source power system components may be unable to provide components to us or extend us credit. Furthermore, we may not be able to successfully anticipate, plan for and respond to changing economic conditions, and our business could be negatively affected.\nFuel price differentials are hard to predict and may have an adverse impact on the demand for our products in the future.\nThe prices of various fuel alternatives are subject to fluctuation, based upon many factors, including changes in resource bases, pipeline transportation capacity for natural gas, refining capacity for crude oil and government excise and fuel tax policies. The price differential among various fuel alternatives can impact OEMs and their decisions to buy power systems from us. For example, if fossil fuel prices increase significantly, OEMs may choose to seek power systems powered by electric motors instead of ones that use fossil fuels. Furthermore, if OEMs do decide to purchase power systems from us, relative fuel prices may affect which power systems they purchase from us. The margins on our sale of certain of our power systems are higher than the margins on other power systems that we sell to our OEM customers. See \u201cChanges in our product mix could materially and adversely affect our business.\u201d\nThe volatility of oil and gas prices may indirectly affect our stock price.\nWhile our company develops alternative fuel spark-engine power systems for off-road industrial equipment and the 8.8 liter engine for on-highway vehicles, we may be indirectly affected by the price of oil and gas. The investing public may categorize our stock with other fuel or alternative energy stocks, thus the volatility of the price of oil and gas may affect the price of our stock. In particular, when the price of oil declines, oil becomes a more favorable source of fuel in the short term and alternative fuel and energy producers suffer as a result. This, as with any commodity volatility, will occur from time to time and may adversely affect the price of our stock.\nPrice increases in some of the key components in our power systems could materially and adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nThe prices of some of the key components of our power systems are subject to fluctuation due to market forces beyond our control, including changes in the costs of raw materials incorporated into these components. Such price increases occur from time to time due to spot shortages of commodities, increases in labor costs or longer-term shortages due to market forces. In particular, the prices of certain precious metals used in our emissions control systems fluctuate frequently and often significantly. Substantial increases in the prices of raw\nmaterials used in components which we source from our suppliers may result in increased prices charged by our suppliers. If we incur price increases from our suppliers for key components in our power systems, our production costs will increase. Given competitive market conditions, we may not be able to pass all or any of those cost increases on to our OEM customers in the form of higher sales prices. To the extent our competitors do not suffer comparable component cost increases to our customers, we may have even greater difficulty passing along price increases and our competitive position may be harmed. As a result, increases in costs of key components may adversely affect our margins and otherwise adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nMany of our power systems involve long and variable design and sales cycles, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations for any given quarter or year.\nThe design and sales cycle for our customized power systems, from initial contact with our potential OEM customer to the commencement of shipments of our power systems, may be lengthy. Customers generally consider a wide range of issues before making a decision to purchase our power systems. Before an industrial OEM commits to purchase our power systems, they often require a significant technical review, assessment of competitive products and approval at a number of management levels within their organization. During the time our customers are evaluating our products, we may incur substantial sales and marketing, engineering and research and development expenses to customize our power systems to the customer\u2019s needs. We may also expend significant management efforts, increase manufacturing capacity, order long-lead-time components or purchase significant amounts of power system components and other inventory prior to receiving an order. Even after this evaluation process, a potential customer may not purchase our products.\nOur existing debt or new debt that we incur could adversely affect our business and growth prospects.\nWe are obliged under a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, NA. Failure or inability to meet our obligations under our current credit agreement or any new credit facility could materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, our debt obligations could make us more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions and could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate. Our indebtedness, the cash flow needed to satisfy our debt and the covenants contained in current and potential future credit agreements have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting funds otherwise available for financing our capital expenditures by requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest on this debt;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities, including mergers, acquisitions and other strategic transactions;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage to those of our competitors that are less indebted than we are;\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable to rising interest rates;\n\u2022\nand making us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business.\nMore specifically, pursuant to our current credit agreement with our senior lender, we have agreed to certain financial covenants, including maintaining certain ratios between our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and our fixed charges. In addition, our current credit agreement places limitations on our ability to make acquisitions of other companies. Any failure by us to comply with the financial covenants set forth in our current credit agreement in the future, if not cured or waived, could result in our senior lender accelerating the maturity of our indebtedness or preventing us from accessing availability under our credit facility. If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash resources to satisfy our debt obligations and we may not be able to continue our operations as planned.\nFurthermore, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face, as described above, could intensify.\nOur quarterly operating results are subject to variability from quarter to quarter.\nOur quarter-to-quarter and quarter-over-quarter operating results (including our sales, gross profit and net income) and cash flows have been, and in the future may be, impacted by a variety of internal and external events associated with our business operations, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such events include (1) changes in regulatory emission requirements (which generally occur on January 1 of the year in which they become effective), (2) customer product phase-in/phase-out programs, (3) supplier product (i.e. a specific engine model) phase-in/phase-out programs, (4) changes in pricing by suppliers to us of engines, components and other parts (typically effective January 1 of any year), and (5) changes in our pricing to our customers (typically effective January 1 of any year), which may be related to changes in the pricing by suppliers to us.\nIn order to mitigate potential availability or pricing issues, customers may adjust their demand requirements from traditional patterns. We may also extend special programs to customers in advance of such events, and we are more likely to offer such programs in our fourth quarter of a year in anticipation of events expected to occur in the first quarter of the next year. The occurrence of any of the events discussed above may result in fluctuations in our operating results (including sales and profitability) and cash flows between and among reporting periods.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, we could lose important proprietary technology, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that the success of our business depends, in substantial part, upon our proprietary technology, information, processes and know-how. The unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology by others could materially harm our business. We do not own any material patents and rely on a combination of trademark and trade secret laws, along with confidentiality agreements, contractual provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. Although certain of our employees have entered into confidentiality agreements with us to protect our proprietary technology and processes, not all of our employees have executed such agreements, nor can we ensure that employees who have executed such agreements will not violate them.\nDespite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, existing laws afford only limited protection, and our actions may be inadequate to protect our rights or to prevent others from claiming violations of their proprietary rights. Unauthorized third parties may attempt to copy, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain, use or exploit aspects of our products and services, develop similar technology independently, or otherwise obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We cannot assure you that our competitors will not independently develop technology similar or superior to our technology or design around our intellectual property.\nIn addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights as fully or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. In particular, we sell our power systems to industrial OEM customers, and source certain components from suppliers, in China, where commercial laws are relatively underdeveloped compared to other geographic markets into which we sell our products. Protection of intellectual property is limited under Chinese law, and the sale of our products and the local sourcing of components may subject us to an increased risk of infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property. As a result, we cannot be certain that we will be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights in China.\nWe may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of other companies\u2019 proprietary rights in the future. However, litigation could result in significant costs or in the diversion of financial resources and management\u2019s attention. We cannot assure you that any such litigation will be successful or that we will prevail over counterclaims against us.\nIn addition, many of the components we source from our suppliers and which are incorporated into our power systems use proprietary intellectual property of our suppliers. We also license or rely upon certain intellectual property from third parties, including the \u201cback office\u201d software and functionality for our telematics tool, MasterTrak. For a description of MasterTrak, our telematics tool, see \u201cBusiness - Our Products and Industry Categories - Connected Asset Services.\u201d Any of these third parties from which we source our power system components, from which we license intellectual property or on whose intellectual property we rely, may also supply these components (or other components that incorporate the same intellectual property) or license or provide such intellectual property, as applicable, to others, including our competitors, or terminate our access to such intellectual property.\nIf we face claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties, we could encounter expensive litigation, be liable for significant damages or incur restrictions on our ability to sell our products and services.\nWe cannot be certain that our products, services and power system technologies, including any intellectual property licensed from third parties for use therein or incorporated into components that we source from our suppliers, do not, or in the future will not, infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of third parties. We are not aware of all of the proprietary technology incorporated into, or used in developing, the components that we source and integrate into our power systems, nor are we familiar with all of the technology included in, or used in developing, products that are competitive with these components. Furthermore, the design, prototyping, testing and engineering capabilities we use to manufacture our power systems are technologically sophisticated, and we consider the processes by which we develop our power systems to be confidential and proprietary trade secrets. To compete in the industrial OEM market, our competitors likely also use proprietary development processes to manufacture their products. Given that neither we nor our competitors make information regarding such manufacturing and development processes available to the public, we cannot know the extent to which there may be any commonality between our respective processes and cannot be certain that we are not infringing on any intellectual property rights of others. In addition, for the above reasons, we cannot assure you that third parties will not claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights.\nWe may in the future be subject to infringement claims that may result in litigation. Successful infringement claims against us could result in substantial monetary liability, require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements, or otherwise materially disrupt the conduct of our business. In addition, even if we prevail in the defense of any such claims, any such litigation could be time-consuming and expensive to defend or settle, and could result in the diversion of the time and attention of management and of operational resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nstop selling and/or using the specific products and/or services incorporating the allegedly infringing technology and/or stop incorporating the allegedly infringing technology into such products and/or services;\n\u2022\nobtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell and/or use the relevant technology, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; or\n\u2022\nredesign the products and/or services that incorporate the allegedly infringing technology.\nWe could suffer warranty claims that could materially and adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time, we may incur liabilities for warranty claims as a result of defective products or components, including claims arising from defective products or components provided by our suppliers that are integrated into our power systems. The provisions we make for warranty accrual may not be sufficient or we may be unable to rely on a warranty provided by a third-party manufacturer, and we may recognize additional expenses as a result of warranty claims in excess of our current expectations. Such warranty claims may necessitate a redesign, re-specification, a change in manufacturing processes, and/or recall of our power systems,\nwhich could have an adverse impact on our finances and on existing or future sales of our power systems and other products. Even in the absence of any warranty claims, a product deficiency such as a manufacturing defect or a safety issue may necessitate a product recall, which could have an adverse impact on our finances and on existing or future sales.\nWe could become subject to product liability claims.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent to natural gas, propane, gasoline and diesel, and products that use these fuels. Natural gas, propane and gasoline are flammable and are potentially dangerous products. Any accidents involving our power systems could materially impede widespread market acceptance and demand for our power systems. In addition, we may be subject to a claim by end-users of our OEM customers\u2019 products or others alleging that they have suffered property damage, personal injury or death because our power systems or the products of our customers into which our power systems are integrated did not perform adequately. Such a claim could be made whether or not our power systems perform adequately under the circumstances. From time to time, we may be subject to product liability claims in the ordinary course of business, and we carry a limited amount of product liability insurance for this purpose. However, our current insurance policies may not provide sufficient or any coverage for such claims, and we cannot predict whether we will be able to maintain our insurance coverage on commercially acceptable terms.\nWe may have difficulty managing the expansion of our operations.\nIn order to effectively manage our operations and growth, including growth in the sales of, and services related to, our power systems, we may need to:\n\u2022\nscale our internal infrastructure, including establishing additional facilities, while continuing to provide technologically sophisticated power systems on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nattract and retain sufficient numbers of talented personnel, including application engineers, customer support staff and production personnel;\n\u2022\ncontinue to enhance our compliance and quality assurance systems; and\n\u2022\ncontinue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures.\nRapid expansion of our operations could place a strain on our senior management team, support teams, manufacturing lines, information technology platforms and other resources. In addition, we may be required to place more reliance on our strategic partners and suppliers, some of whom may not be capable of meeting our production demands in terms of timing, quantity, quality or cost. Difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by any rapid expansion could harm our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.\nIf we do not properly manage the sales of our products into foreign markets, our business could suffer.\nWe have sales and distribution activities in Asia and Europe, where we may lack sufficient expertise, knowledge of local customs or contacts. In Asia, we depend upon an independent sales and support organization to complement our OEM relationships and provide knowledge of local customs and requirements, while also providing immediate sales assistance and customer support. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current relationship with this independent sales and support organization, or that we will be able to develop effective, similar relationships in foreign markets into which we supply our products in the future.\nGrowing the market for our products in Asia and other markets outside of the United States may take longer and cost more to develop than we anticipate and is subject to inherent risks, including unexpected changes in government policies, trade barriers restricting our ability to sell our products in those countries, longer payment cycles, exposure to currency fluctuations, and foreign exchange controls that restrict or prohibit repatriation of funds. As a result, if we do not properly manage foreign sales, our business could suffer.\nIn addition, our foreign sales subject us to numerous stringent U.S. and foreign laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and comparable foreign laws and regulations which prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Safeguards that we may implement to discourage these practices could prove to be ineffective, and violations of the FCPA and other laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities or proceedings against us, including class action lawsuits and enforcement actions from the SEC, Department of Justice and overseas regulators. Any of these factors, or any other international factors, could impair our ability to effectively sell our power systems, or other products or services that we may develop, outside of the U.S.\nIf our production facilities become inoperable, our business, including our ability to manufacture our power systems, will be harmed.\nWe operate our business, including all of our production and manufacturing processes, out of facilities that are all located in Wood Dale, Illinois and Darien, Wisconsin. If damaged, our facilities, our manufacturing lines, the equipment we use to perform our emission certification and other tests and our other business process systems would be costly to replace and could require substantial time to repair or replace. We are particularly subject to this risk because of the current geographic concentration of our facilities in Wood Dale, Illinois which accounted for over 90% of our fiscal 2014 net sales. Our facilities may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including inclement weather, earthquakes, wildfires, floods, acts of terrorism or other criminal activities, infectious disease outbreaks and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to efficiently operate our business for some period of time. In addition, such events may temporarily interrupt our ability to receive engines, fuel systems or other components for our power systems from our suppliers and to have access to our various production systems necessary to operate our business. Our insurance covering damage to our properties and the disruption of our business may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIn the event our facilities are damaged or destroyed, we may need to find another facility into which we can move our operations. Finding a facility that meets the criteria necessary to operate our business would be time-consuming and costly and result in delays in our ability to provide our sophisticated power systems or to provide the same level of quality in our services as we currently provide.\nWe may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters.\nOur workforce consists of full-time and part-time employees, as well as members of our production team whose services we obtain through an arrangement with a professional employer organization. While none of the members of our workforce are currently represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, there have been unsuccessful efforts to unionize our manufacturing employees in the past, and there can be no assurance that members of our workforce will not in the future join a union. If our employees organize and join a union in the future, there can be no assurance that future issues with our workforce will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. Any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce.\nIn addition, many of our suppliers have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slow-downs experienced by our material suppliers could result in slow-downs or closures at the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers from where our power system components are sourced. If one or more of our key suppliers experience a material work stoppage, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected by increased compensation costs or difficulties in attracting staff for our business including those related to our acquisition of Professional Power Products, Inc.\nCompensation is a significant component of our operating costs, and we believe talented and hardworking staff are a key part of our success. We devote significant resources to training our staff. Increased compensation costs due to factors like additional taxes or benefit costs, including the requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as well as competition, increased minimum wage requirements, and other benefit mandates that may be required in the future could adversely impact our operating results. Our success depends in part on our ability to hire, motivate, and retain qualified staff. As we continue to expand, we will need to promote or hire additional staff, and it may be difficult to attract or retain such individuals as a result of these increased compensation and benefit mandates without incurring significant additional costs.\nThe loss of one or more key members of our senior management, or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business.\nOur success and future growth depends to a significant degree on the skills and continued services of our management team, in particular Gary Winemaster, our Chief Executive Officer and President, Eric Cohen, our Chief Operating Officer and Daniel Gorey, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as other members of management and key employees of our affiliates and subsidiaries. The loss of any of our key members of management could inhibit our growth prospects, limit our acquisition and joint venture opportunities or impede upon our integration of acquired businesses, technologies services or products, including Professional Power Products, Inc. Our future success also depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate key management, engineering, manufacturing and operating personnel. As we develop additional capabilities, we may require more skilled personnel. Given the highly specialized nature of our power systems, these personnel must be highly skilled and have a sound understanding of our industry, business and our technology. The market for such personnel is highly competitive. As a result, we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the personnel needed to support our business.\nGovernmental regulation in one or more of the following areas may adversely affect our existing and future operations and financial results, including harming our ability to expand or by increasing our operating costs.\nWe are subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our staff, including wage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, family leave mandates, requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insurance and workers\u2019 compensation rules and anti-discrimination laws. Complying with these rules can be cumbersome and subjects us to substantial expense. These rules can also expose us to liabilities arising from claims for non-compliance. We could suffer losses from, and we could incur legal costs to defend lawsuits or claims, and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant. In addition, several states and localities in which we operate and the federal government from time to time have enacted minimum wage increases, paid sick leave and mandatory vacation accruals, and similar requirements and such changes, when enacted, could increase our compensation costs and have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nWe are subject to state and federal immigration laws, and the U.S. Congress and Department of Homeland Security from time to time consider or implement changes to Federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs. Changes in immigration or work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome, or reduce the availability of potential qualified staff. Although we require all workers to provide us with government-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our staff may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. Ineligible staff may subject us to fines or penalties, and we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our business, disrupted operations and difficulty hiring and retaining qualified staff.\nClaims arising from inadequate documentation of the eligibility of our staff as a result of not fully complying with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliance laws could result in other penalties and costs that could have a material adverse effect our operating results.\nWe are also audited from time to time for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements. Unauthorized staff may subject us to fines or penalties, and if any of our staff are found to be unauthorized our business may be disrupted as we try to replace lost staff with other qualified individuals. On the other hand, in the event we wrongfully reject work authorization documents, or if our compliance procedures are found to have a disparate impact on a protected class, such as a racial minority or based on the citizenship status of applicants, we could be found to be in violation of anti-discrimination laws. We could experience adverse publicity arising from enforcement activity related to work authorization compliance, anti-discrimination compliance, or both, that negatively impacts our business, adversely impacts our operating results, and may make it more difficult to hire and retain qualified staff.\nWe could be adversely affected by risks associated with acquisitions and joint ventures, including our acquisition of Professional Power Products, Inc.\nFrom time to time, we may seek to expand our business through investments in, joint ventures with or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, subject to our business plans and management\u2019s ability to identify, acquire and develop suitable investments or acquisition targets in both new and existing industrial OEM market categories and geographic markets. In certain circumstances, acceptable investments or acquisition targets might not be available. Acquisitions involve a number of risks, including: (1) difficulty in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of an acquired business, including consolidating redundant facilities and infrastructure; (2) potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our day-to-day operations; (3) difficulty entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience and in which competitors have a stronger market position; (4) difficulty maintaining the quality of services that such acquired companies have historically provided; (5) potential legal and financial responsibility for liabilities of acquired businesses; (6) overpayment for the acquired company or assets or failure to achieve anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; (7) increased expenses associated with completing an acquisition and amortizing any acquired intangible assets; (8) challenges in implementing uniform standards, accounting policies, customs, controls, procedures and policies throughout an acquired business; (9) failure to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business; and (10) loss of customers and a failure to integrate customer bases.\nWe may be subject to some or all of the risks and uncertainties described above in connection with our acquisition of Professional Power Products, Inc., particularly because it was the first acquisition we have completed. The economic benefits, cost savings and other synergies that we anticipate as a result of that transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than we expect. Furthermore, the operating results of the Professional Power Products, Inc. business may be more volatile and less predictable than those of our core business. In addition, we incurred substantial additional indebtedness to finance the cash purchase price we paid to acquire Professional Power Products, Inc., reducing our capacity to borrow additional amounts and requiring us to dedicate a greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the cash resources available to us to fund capital expenditures, pursue other acquisitions or investments in new technologies and meet general corporate and working capital needs. This increased indebtedness may also limit our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry.\nIf we were to pursue future acquisition or investment opportunities, the potential risks could disrupt our ongoing business, result in the loss of key customers or personnel, increase expenses and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, under the terms of our credit facility, we may be restricted from engaging in certain acquisition transactions. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and capital resources.\u201d\nOur joint ventures into the Asian market may not be successful.\nIn 2012, we entered into a joint venture with another entity for the purpose of manufacturing, assembling and selling certain power systems into the Asian market, and specifically to distribute such power systems from the joint venture\u2019s manufacturing facility in China. The facility in China was completed in 2013 and manufacturing is due to commence in the near future. Further, in late 2014, we entered into a joint venture with a worldwide construction and utility equipment manufacturer headquartered in South Korea. The joint venture, equally owned by both companies, will leverage the strengths of each to design, develop, produce, market and distribute industrial gas power systems to the global market. There can be no assurances that the joint ventures will be successful. The formation of the ventures and establishment of the businesses will require significant management and capital resources and there can be no assurances that such resources will be available. Operations at the joint ventures could expose us to risks inherent in such activities, such as protection of our intellectual property, economic and political stability, labor matters, language and cultural differences, including cultural differences that could be construed as violations of U.S. or other anti-bribery laws; and the need to manage product development, operations and sales activities that are located a long distance from our headquarters. The management of new product development activities and the sharing or transfer of technological capabilities to the joint ventures will expose us to risks. In addition, from time to time in the future, our joint venture partners may have economic or business interests or goals that are different from ours. Furthermore, each joint venture will require us to make equity contributions from time to time up to specified amounts. If each joint venture business does not progress according to our plans and anticipated timing, our investment in the joint ventures may not be considered successful.\nFailure to raise additional capital or to generate the significant capital necessary to continue our growth could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. Our current credit facility contains covenants restricting our ability to enter into additional debt financing. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and capital resources - Credit agreement\u201d for a description of our credit facility. We may offer and sell common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depositary shares, warrants, subscription rights, stock purchase contracts and units under a universal shelf registration statement, which was declared effective on February 14, 2014. If we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests, and the per share value of our common stock could decline. Furthermore, if we engage in additional debt financing, the holders of debt would have priority over the holders of common stock, and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, and take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of our stockholders and force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not, among other things, be able to:\n\u2022\ncontinue to expand our research and product development operations and sales and marketing organization;\n\u2022\nexpand operations both organically and through acquisitions;\n\u2022\nor respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.\nWe are and will continue to be subject to foreign laws, rules and regulations as our business expands into these foreign markets and cannot be certain as to our continued compliance and costs related thereto.\nWe are subject to, and may become subject to additional, state, federal and international laws and regulations governing our environmental, labor, trade and tax practices. These laws and regulations, particularly those applicable to our international operations, are or may be complex, extensive and subject to change. We will need to ensure that we and our OEM customers and suppliers timely comply with such laws and regulations,\nwhich may result in an increase in our operating costs. For example, in August 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted final rules to implement Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act intended to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries, which obligates us to conduct a reasonable country of origin inquiry with respect to conflict minerals included in components of products we directly manufacture, contract to manufacture and purchase to include in products. Other legislation has been, and may in the future be, enacted in other locations where we manufacture or sell our products. In addition, climate change and financial reform legislation in the United States is a significant topic of discussion and has generated and may continue to generate federal or other regulatory responses in the near future. If we or our component suppliers fail to timely comply with applicable legislation, our customers may refuse to purchase our products or we may face increased operating costs as a result of taxes, fines or penalties, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In connection with our compliance with such environmental laws and regulations, as well as our compliance with industry environmental initiatives, the standards of business conduct required by some of our customers, and our commitment to sound corporate citizenship in all aspects of our business, we could incur substantial compliance and operating costs and be subject to disruptions to our operations and logistics. In addition, if we were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliant with these initiatives or standards of conduct, we could be subject to governmental fines, liability to our customers and damage to our reputation and corporate brand which could cause our financial condition or operating results to suffer.\nWe could become liable for damages resulting from our manufacturing activities.\nThe nature of our manufacturing operations exposes us to potential claims and liability for environmental damage, personal injury, loss of life and damage to, or destruction of, property. Our manufacturing operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations that govern environmental protection and human health and safety. These laws and regulations have changed frequently in the past and it is reasonable to expect additional and more stringent changes in the future. Our manufacturing operations may not comply with future laws and regulations, and we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures to bring our operations within compliance with such regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, manufacturing guidelines, and workplace safety requirements, governmental authorities may seek to impose fines and penalties on us or to revoke or deny the issuance or renewal of operating permits, and private parties may seek damages from us. Under such circumstances, we could be required to curtail or cease operations, conduct site remediation or other corrective action, or pay substantial damage claims for which we may not have sufficient or any insurance coverage for claims.\nWe may have unanticipated tax liabilities that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to various types of taxes in the U.S., as well as foreign jurisdictions into which we supply our products. The determination of our provision for income taxes and other tax accruals involves various judgments, and therefore the ultimate tax determination is subject to uncertainty. In addition, changes in tax laws, regulations, or rules may adversely affect our future reported financial results, may impact the way in which we conduct our business, or may increase the risk of audit by the Internal Revenue Service or other tax authority. Although we are not subject to any audits currently, we may be in the future subject to an Internal Revenue Service audit or other audit by state, local and foreign tax authorities. The final determinations of any tax audits in the U.S. or abroad could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. If any taxing authority disagrees with the positions taken by us on our tax returns, we could incur additional tax liabilities, including interest and penalties.\nChanges in accounting standards or inaccurate estimates or assumptions in applying accounting policies could adversely affect us.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and results of operations and are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. If those assumptions, estimates or judgments were incorrectly made, we could be required to correct and restate prior-period financial statements.\nVariability in self-insurance liability estimates could significantly impact our results of operations.\nWe self-insure for employee health insurance coverage up to a predetermined level, beyond which we maintain stop-loss insurance from a third-party insurer. Our aggregate exposure varies from year to year based upon the number of participants in this health insurance plan. We estimate our self-insurance liabilities using an analysis provided by our claims administrator and our historical claims experience. Our accruals for insurance reserves reflect these estimates and other management judgments, which are subject to a high degree of variability. Any significant variation in these estimates and judgments could cause a material change to our reserves for self-insurance liabilities, as well as our earnings.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of our Common Stock\nWe incur significant costs and demands upon management and accounting and finance resources as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies; any failure to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or to recruit, train and retain necessary accounting and finance personnel could have an adverse effect on our ability to accurately and timely prepare our financial statements.\nAs a public operating company, we incur significant administrative, legal, accounting and other burdens and expenses beyond those of a private company, including those associated with corporate governance requirements, public company reporting obligations and NASDAQ listing requirements. In particular, we have needed to enhance and supplement our internal accounting resources with additional accounting and finance personnel with the requisite technical and public company experience and expertise, as well as refine our quarterly and annual financial statement closing process, to enable us to satisfy such reporting obligations.\nFurthermore, we are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures and prepare annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. These assessments must include disclosure of identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The existence of one or more material weaknesses could affect the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting. Testing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting involves significant costs and could divert management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to our business. Additionally, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in remediating any deficiencies that may be identified. If we are unable to remediate any such deficiencies or otherwise fail to establish and maintain adequate accounting systems and internal control over financial reporting, or we are unable to continue to recruit, train and retain necessary accounting and finance personnel, we may not be able to accurately and timely prepare our financial statements and otherwise satisfy our public reporting obligations. Any inaccuracies in our financial statements or other public disclosures (in particular if resulting in the need to restate previously filed financial statements), or delays in our making required SEC filings, could have a material adverse effect on the confidence in our financial reporting, our credibility in the marketplace and the trading price of our common stock.\nIn prior periods, as a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we were able to take advantage of an exemption from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As we no longer qualify as a\nsmaller reporting company, compliance with these auditor attestation requirements have required additional costs and significant time and resources from our management and finance and accounting personnel. See \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures,\u201d for Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nFurthermore, we are now deemed to be an \u201caccelerated filer\u201d and are subject to time constraints with respect to our financial and public reporting obligations. While we used every effort to plan accordingly for this reporting obligation and NASDAQ listing requirements we cannot be certain that our planning will continue to be effective and timely. The reporting obligations pertain not only to the finance and accounting departments, but impact almost all employees, processes and technology throughout our company.\nIn addition, our management team must continue to adapt to other requirements of being a public company. We need to devote significant resources to address these public company-associated requirements, including compliance programs and investor relations, as well as our financial reporting obligations. We incur substantial legal and financial compliance costs as a result of complying with these rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC.\nConcentration of ownership among our existing executive officers may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nAs of March 3, 2015, Gary Winemaster, our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President, and Kenneth Winemaster, Senior Vice President, beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 56.41% of our outstanding shares of common stock. On a fully-diluted basis, assuming the exercise of all outstanding warrants and outstanding stock appreciation rights, such individuals beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 53.75% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As of March 3, 2015, Gary Winemaster alone beneficially owned approximately 36.09% of our outstanding shares of common stock. On a fully diluted basis, assuming the exercise of all outstanding warrants and outstanding stock appreciation rights, Gary Winemaster alone beneficially owned approximately 34.39% of our outstanding shares of common stock.\nAs a result of Gary Winemaster\u2019s and Kenneth Winemaster\u2019s beneficial ownership of a significant majority of our outstanding shares of common stock, these stockholders can exercise control over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our articles of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions impossible without the support of these stockholders.\nThe price of our stock may be volatile and may decline in value.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including the price of oil and gas or other fuel sources, some of which are beyond our control. The stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies with securities traded in those markets. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies\u2019 stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nFuture sales by us or our existing stockholders could depress the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of common stock, or the perception that sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We may offer and sell common stock, preferred stock,\ndebt securities, depositary shares, warrants, subscription rights, stock purchase contracts and units under a universal shelf registration statement, which was declared effective on February 14, 2014. If we or our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock, or if we sell additional securities that are convertible into common stock, in the future, the market price of our common stock similarly could decline. Further, even the perception in the public market that we or our existing stockholders might sell shares of common stock could depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nFrom time to time, we release guidance regarding our future performance that represents our management\u2019s estimates as of the date of release. This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in the release. Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the guidance and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. Guidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, is inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. The principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons. Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results will vary from the guidance, and the variations may be material. Investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data is forecast. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it. Any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could result in the actual operating results being different than the guidance, and such differences may be adverse and material.\nWe have discretion in the use of borrowings under our revolving line of credit and may use them in a manner in which our stockholders would not consider appropriate.\nOur management has broad discretion in the application of the borrowings under our revolving line of credit. Our stockholders may not agree with the manner in which our management chooses to allocate and spend these funds. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nIn addition to the concentration of ownership described under \u201cConcentration of ownership among our existing executive officers and their affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions\u201d above, which will prevent any attempt to acquire control of our company not supported by these significant stockholders, our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions which could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Our organizational documents, include provisions authorizing \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which may be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management. Provisions of Delaware law may also have anti-takeover effects. Any provision of\nour certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur stockholders may experience significant dilution if future equity offerings are used to fund operations or acquire complementary businesses.\nIf we engage in capital raising activities in the future, including issuances of common stock, to fund the growth of our business, our stockholders could experience significant dilution. In addition, securities issued in connection with future financing activities or potential acquisitions may have rights and preferences senior to the rights and preferences of our common stock.\nDuring 2012, we adopted the 2012 Incentive Compensation Plan, which was amended in 2013 to increase the number of shares available for awards pursuant to this plan. The issuance of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of any equity awards granted pursuant to this plan may result in dilution to our stockholders and adversely affect our earnings. See \u201cExecutive Compensation - 2012 Incentive Compensation Plan\u201d for a description of this plan.\nIf securities or industry analysts cease publishing, research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the extent to which industry or securities analysts publish research and reports about us, our business, our market or our competitors and what they publish in those reports. Any analysts that do cover us may make adverse recommendations regarding our stock, adversely change their recommendations from time to time, and/or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors. If any analyst who covers us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe payment of dividends is currently restricted by our credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. We intend to retain our future earnings to support operations and to finance expansion and, therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Because we do not anticipate paying dividends in the future, the only opportunity to realize the value of our common stock will likely be through an appreciation in value and a sale of those shares. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which a stockholder purchased his, her or its shares.", "PERMNO": 13939, "SIC": 3510, "TIC": "PSIX"}
