RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risks associated with an investment in our common stock and all of the other information in this 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial. If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nThe lack of willingness of our vendors to do business with us or to provide adequate payment terms could negatively impact our liquidity and/or reduce the accessibility of products or services we seek to acquire.\nWe depend on our vendors to provide us with credit terms on our purchases of materials and services. Our vendors could seek to limit the availability of vendor credit to us or modify terms under which they sell to us, or both, thereby adversely impacting our liquidity. As of the date of this report, we have not experienced any significant disruption in our access to materials, services or our operations; however, there can be no assurance that one or more of our vendors may not slow or cease shipments or require or condition the sale or shipment of materials on new payment terms or other assurances. Such circumstances could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict whether our plans to enhance our financial flexibility and liquidity to fund our operations will be successful.\nWe continue to pursue our business growth plans and potential initiatives to enhance our financial flexibility and liquidity. We have experienced significant losses and incurred negative operating cash flows for the past several years, and accordingly we have taken a number of actions to fund our operations and meet our obligations. We also expect to pursue other near-term actions to support liquidity as further described under Uses and Sources of Liquidity. However, if we continue to incur losses, additional actions may be required to further enhance our liquidity and financial flexibility. The achievement of our initiatives is subject to risks and uncertainties in relation to market conditions and other factors that may cause our actual performance and results to differ materially from our plans. We cannot assure that cash flows and other internal and external sources of liquidity will at all times be sufficient for our cash requirements. We may need to consider actions to improve our cash position, mitigate any potential liquidity shortfall, pursue additional sources of liquidity, and reduce costs. There can be no assurance that such actions would be successful, and we cannot predict the outcome of any actions to generate liquidity, whether such actions would generate the expected liquidity as currently planned, or the availability of additional debt financing. The specific actions taken, the timing, and the overall amount will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, interest in specific assets, valuations of those assets and the underlying operating performance. If we continue to incur operating losses and/or we are not able to generate additional liquidity, the company could be negatively impacted in relation to access to materials or services that are important to the operation of our business.\nOur sales may fluctuate for a variety of reasons, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business is sensitive to customers' spending patterns, which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions. Our sales and results of operations have fluctuated in the past, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of other factors affect our sales and financial performance, including: actions by our competitors; changes in our product strategy and mix; and impacts due to extreme weather events.\nAccordingly, our results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter and comparable sales for any particular future period may increase or decrease.\nOur failure to comply with federal, state, local and international laws, or changes in these laws, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to legal risk and government enforcement action that could increase our cost of doing business. Changes in the regulatory environment regarding topics such as product safety and environmental protection could also cause our compliance costs to increase and adversely affect our results of operations. Our performance could also be impacted by trade policies and agreements, changes in legislation, energy and environmental standards, and tax laws and regulations. Additionally, future legislation or regulations, including environmental matters, product certification, product liability, tariffs, and other matters, may impact our results of operations and liquidity.\nCustomers in the oil and gas industry account for a significant portion of our sales. Reduced expenditures by customers in this industry are likely to reduce demand for our products and services.\nCustomers related to the upstream, midstream and downstream oil and gas industry accounted for approximately 64% and 78% of our net sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Brazil operations has invested in plant expansion and personnel over the past several years to pursue the oil and gas production, marine and industrial markets to reduce our reliance on upstream oil & gas (offshore production). Our business is still sensitive to cyclical commodity oil and natural gas prices that impact product demand and prices.\nOur products include complex systems for energy and industrial markets which are subject to operational and liability risks.\nWe are engaged in the installation of complex power distribution and control systems for the energy and industrial markets. These systems are frequently complex and susceptible to unique engineering elements that are not tested in the actual operating environment until commissioned. As a result, we may incur unanticipated additional operating and warranty expenses that were not anticipated when the fixed-price contracts were estimated and executed resulting in reduced profit margins on such projects.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive, which may result in a loss of market share or decrease in net sales or profit margin.\nOur products and services are provided in a highly competitive environment and we are subject to competition from a number of similarly sized or larger businesses which may have greater financial and other resources than are available to us. Factors that affect competition include timely delivery of products and services, reputation, manufacturing capabilities, price, performance and dependability. Any failure to adapt to a changing competitive environment may result in a loss of market share and a decrease in net sales and profit margins.\nWe have a risk of loss to a disputed working capital adjustment in the sale of M&I\nThe contractual terms of the sale of U.S. assets to Myers Power Products, Inc. (the \u201cBuyer\u201d) in August included a provision to true-up the net working capital, estimated as of the date of closing, to the actual working capital as calculated by the Buyer and agreed to by the Seller. Any difference in actual (conclusive) net working capital in relation to the estimated working capital at closing could result in an adjustment to the purchase price. Subsequent to September 30, 2018, the Company received notification from the Buyer of their actual working capital calculation. In the notification, the Buyer has communicated a decrease of approximately $4.3 million dollars in net working capital, in comparison to the estimated working capital used at the contract closing. In the event the Buyer and Seller cannot agree to a conclusive net working capital adjustment, then all items remaining in dispute shall be submitted by either one of the parties within thirty (30) calendar days after the expiration of the resolution period to a national or regional independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to Buyer and Seller (the \"Neutral Arbitrator\"). The Neutral Arbitrator shall act as an arbitrator to determine the conclusive net working capital. The conclusive net working capital, once finally determined, may result in a purchase price adjustment due to the Buyer or to the Company as Seller.\nAs of the date of the filing of the 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2018, the Company disagrees with the buyers working capital calculation and has not received documentation sufficient to support the Buyer\u2019s position. As such, no adjustments have been considered in determining the gain on the sale of assets reported as of December 31, 2018. The resulting purchase price adjustment based on the conclusive net working capital adjustment, if any, would be reflected in the future period if it is required.\nManagement believes there is minimal changes to the estimated net working capital.\nWe rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could disrupt our operations or be adverse to our business.\nOur continued success is dependent on the continuity of several key management, operating and technical personnel. The loss of these key employees could have a negative impact on our future growth and profitability.\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted by economic uncertainty and global recession.\nThe consequences of a prolonged recession could include a lower level of economic activity and uncertainty regarding commodity and capital markets. The lack of a sustained economic recovery could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nOur failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could lead to a loss of net sales or profitability.\nOur ability to provide high-quality products and services on a timely basis requires that we employ an adequate number of skilled personnel. Accordingly, our ability to increase our productivity and profitability will be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our requirements. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy or that our labor expenses will not increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel.\nNatural disasters, terrorism, acts of war, international conflicts or other disruptions could harm our business and operations.\nNatural disasters acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, and the actions taken by the United States and other governments in response to such events could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations or those of our customers, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe install products and operate in Brazil. Extreme weather conditions could result in disruption or delay of customer projects and production and delivery of materials and products in our supply chain. In addition, natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, or a combination of these or other factors could damage or destroy our facilities negatively affecting our business and results of operations as well as causing us to incur significant expenses to repair or replace such facilities. We carry insurance to minimize our risk of loss; however, actual losses may exceed insurance limits. Additionally, the costs associated with a slowdown of operations caused by a disruption in the supply chain may not be covered.\nWe generate most of our net sales from international operations and are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the United States.\nApproximately 100% of our net sales in 2018 were generated from projects and business operations outside of the United States, primarily provided to the oil and gas production and marine industries in Brazil and Argentina. The oil and gas industry operate in both remote and potentially politically unstable locations, and numerous risks and uncertainties affect our non-United States operations. These risks and uncertainties include changes in political, economic and social environments, local labor conditions, changes in laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments, as well as United States laws affecting activities of United States companies abroad, including tax laws and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights. In addition, the costs of providing our services can be adversely and/or unexpectedly impacted by the remoteness of the locations and other logistical factors.\nThe marketplace may not accept and utilize our newly developed products and services, the effect of which would prevent us from successfully commercializing our proposed products or services and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to market and commercialize our new products and services depends on the acceptance of such products and services by the industry.\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially and may continue to do so. Future announcements or disclosures concerning us or any of our competitors, our strategic initiatives, our sales and profitability, any quarterly variations in actual or anticipated operating results or comparable sales, any failure to meet analysts' expectations and sales of large blocks of our common stock, among other factors, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.\nOur common stock could be delisted from NASDAQ if we do not comply with NASDAQ\u2019s listing standards.\nOur common stock is currently listed for quotation on the NASDAQ Capital Market. On October 15, 2018, the Company received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the NASDAQ Capital Market notifying the Company that, for the last 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the letter, the bid price for its common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued inclusion on the NASDAQ Capital Market. The Company was provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until April 15, 2019, to regain compliance with the listing requirements. We have committed to NASDAQ to undertake a reverse stock split in order to comply with the minimum listing requirement and we are awaiting response from them which may grant us additional time to do so. Under certain circumstances, NASDAQ could require that the minimum bid price exceed $1.00 for more than ten consecutive days before determining that our common stock complies with NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing standards.\nIf our common stock is delisted by NASDAQ, our common stock may be eligible to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board or another over-the-counter market. Any such alternative would likely result in it being more difficult for the Company to raise additional capital through the public or private sale of equity securities and for investors to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of the common stock and could result in a decrease in the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock. In addition, there can be no assurance that the common stock would be eligible for trading on any such alternative exchange or markets.\nJoint Venture limited life risk.\nThe joint venture, BOMAY, was formed in 2006 in China with limited life term of 12 years. The joint venture may be terminated earlier for valid business reasons including Force Majeure. In the event the joint venture is to be terminated, either party may acquire the other parties\u2019 interests and continue the operations of the joint venture. The joint venture agreement includes provisions for extending the life of BOMAY agreement of all parties. In such case, the joint venture shall apply for the extension to the relevant Chinese authority six months before expiry of the venture. In March 2018, BOMAY\u2019s Board of Directors approved a ten year extension of the term of the joint venture agreement to 2028; however, the Company remains subject to the risks associated with a limited life business venture.\nRisk related to our Chinese Joint Venture.\nWe maintain a significant investment in a joint venture with a Chinese energy company. We may encounter risks pertaining to a weakening Chinese economic environment. We may encounter unforeseen or unexpected operating, financial, political or cultural factors that could impact its business plans and the expected profitability from such investment. We will face risks if China loses normal trade relations with the United States and it may be adversely affected by the diplomatic and political relationships between the United States and China. We may also face additional risk with respect to the protection of our intellectual property in China. Changes in China\u2019s political and economic policies could adversely affect our investment and business opportunities in China.\nRisk from Restricted U.S. Government Access to Audit Documents in China.\nThe audit of BOMAY for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was conducted in China by a Chinese audit firm not registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) under the direction of the Company\u2019s independent auditor. The Company\u2019s independent auditor has directed additional procedures to comply with auditing standards prescribed by the PCAOB.\nUnder the laws of the United States, auditors of public companies are to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB and to make all requested work papers available for the SEC and the PCAOB inspection. However, due to laws of the People\u2019s Republic of China applicable to auditors, the SEC and the PCAOB are currently unable to conduct such inspections on work papers prepared in China without the approval of the Chinese government authorities.\nAs a result, the SEC or PCAOB may be unable to conduct inspections of the BOMAY audit work papers. The Company\u2019s stockholders may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB inspections and may lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of portions of our financial statements.\nOur international operations are generally subject to a number of risks. These include:\n\u2022\nforeign laws and business practices that favor local competition\u037e\n\u2022\ndependence on local channel partners\u037e\n\u2022\ncompliance with multiple, conflicting and changing government laws and regulations\u037e\n\u2022\nlonger sales cycles\u037e\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing and staffing foreign operations\u037e\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations\u037e\n\u2022\npolitical and economic stability\u037e\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in hiring qualified personnel\u037e and\n\u2022\ndifficulties with financial reporting in foreign countries.\nJoint Venture Centralized Government Risks\nSince the centralized government of China controls most of the petroleum industry and related manufacturing through annual planning and budgets, the financial results realized by the Company\u2019s joint venture, BOMAY, will reflect the government\u2019s decisions on production levels for oil and gas equipment. The Company further understands that the value of BOMAY\u2019s assets, including inventory, may not be fully realized if demand for these products is reduced significantly because of economic policy decisions or other organizational changes in the Chinese petroleum industry.\nMarket Risk\nThe markets in which we participate are capital intensive and cyclical in nature. The volatility in customer demand is greatly driven by the change in the price of oil and gas. These factors influence the release of new capital projects by our customers, which are\ntraditionally awarded in competitive bid situations. Coordination of project start dates is matched to the customer requirements and projects may take a number of months to complete; schedules also may change during the course of any particular project.\nForeign Currency Transaction Risk\nThe Company operates a subsidiary in Brazil and maintains equity method investment in its Chinese joint venture, BOMAY. The functional currencies of the Brazilian subsidiary and the Chinese joint venture are the Brazilian Real and Chinese Yuan, respectively. Investments are translated into United States Dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each quarterly reporting period. The resulting translation adjustment is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets. The translation adjustment at December 31, 2018 was an accumulated loss $0.4 million due principally to the weakening of the Chinese Yuan versus the United States Dollar.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe are subject to commodity price risk from fluctuating market prices of certain raw materials. While such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers, commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations. We endeavor to recoup these price increases from our customers on an individual contract basis to avoid operating margin erosion. Although historically we have not entered into any contracts to hedge commodity risk, we may do so in the future. Commodity price changes can have a material impact on our prospective earnings and cash flows. Copper, steel and aluminum represent a significant element of our material cost. Significant increases in the prices of these materials could reduce our estimated operating margins if we are unable to recover such increases from our customers.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur interest rate sensitive items do not subject us to material risk exposures. We have no material debt except for the Brazil note payable to our previous chairman.", "PERMNO": 86812, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "SLNG"}
