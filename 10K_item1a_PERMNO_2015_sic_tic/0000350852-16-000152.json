Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent to our business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference herein. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. See also, \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\" If any of the following risks actually occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nEconomic Risk\nCTBI may continue to be adversely affected by economic and market conditions.\nBeginning in 2008, the U.S. economy faced a severe economic crisis including a major recession from which it is slowly recovering. Commerce and business growth across a wide range of industries and regions in the U.S. remains reduced and local governments and many businesses continue to experience financial difficulty. Future federal budget negotiations, the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the level of U.S. debt, the Federal Open Market Committee's plan for economic easing, and declining oil prices may have a destabilizing effect on financial markets or a negative effect on the economy.\nOur financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where we operate, in the states of Kentucky, West Virginia, and Tennessee and in the United States as a whole. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity, or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment; natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\nOverall, during recent years, the business environment has been adverse for many households and businesses in the United States and worldwide. While economic conditions in the United States and worldwide have improved since the recession, there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue. Economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding continuing economic improvement may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing, and savings habits. Such conditions could adversely affect the credit quality of our loans and our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEconomy of Our Markets\nOur business may continue to be adversely affected by ongoing weaknesses in the local economies on which we depend.\nOur loan portfolio is concentrated primarily in eastern, northeastern, central, and south central Kentucky, southern West Virginia, and northeastern Tennessee. Our profits depend on providing products and services to clients in these local regions. While unemployment rates have improved in many areas of the United States, unemployment rates remain elevated in certain markets in which we operate. Recent economic conditions in the coal industry could result in increased unemployment in the markets we serve where coal is a major contributor to the economy. Increases in unemployment, decreases in real estate values, or increases in interest rates could weaken the local economies in which we operate. These economic indicators typically affect certain industries, such as real estate and financial services, more significantly. The coal industry is likely to continue to be adversely affected by legislation and administrative rule-making as well as the increased availability of alternative energy sources such as natural gas. High levels of unemployment and depressed real estate asset values in the markets we serve would likely prolong the economic recovery period in our market area. Weakness in our market area could depress our earnings and consequently our financial condition because:\n\u00b7\nClients may not want, need, or qualify for our products and services;\n\u00b7\nBorrowers may not be able to repay their loans;\n\u00b7\nThe value of the collateral securing our loans to borrowers may decline; and\n\u00b7\nThe quality of our loan portfolio may decline.\nMortgage Assistance Risk\nAs government funded mortgage assistance programs lapse, consumer real estate defaults may increase.\nDuring the economic recession, various legislation was enacted designed to assist those hit hardest through economic subsidies. These subsidies most often came in the form of mortgage payment assistance or mortgage note restructuring. Examples of these programs include: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Alternatives to Foreclosure In House Modification Program, Kentucky Housing Unemployed Bridge Loan Program, Tennessee Hardest Hit Fund, Home Affordable Modification Program Home Affordable Refinance Program, and Freddie Mac Alternatives to Foreclosure. As these programs sunset or as the participants complete their eligibility in the program(s), we may experience significantly higher levels of past due mortgage loans and default rates.\nInterest Rate Risk\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nOur earnings and financial condition are dependent to a large degree upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned from loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The narrowing of interest-rate spreads, meaning the difference between the interest rates earned on loans and investments and the interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings, could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nThe rate of inflation;\n\u00b7\nThe rate of economic growth;\n\u00b7\nEmployment levels;\n\u00b7\nMonetary policies; and\n\u00b7\nInstability in domestic and foreign financial markets.\nChanges in market interest rates will also affect the level of voluntary prepayments on our loans and the receipt of payments on our mortgage-backed securities resulting in the receipt of proceeds that may be reinvested at a lower rate than the loan or mortgage-backed security being prepaid.\nWe originate residential loans for sale and for our portfolio. The origination of loans for sale is designed to meet client financing needs and earn fee income. The origination of loans for sale is highly dependent upon the local real estate market and the level and trend of interest rates. Increasing interest rates may reduce the origination of loans for sale and consequently the fee income we earn. While our commercial banking, construction, and income property business lines remain a significant portion of our activities, high interest rates may reduce our mortgage-banking activities and thereby our income. In contrast, decreasing interest rates have the effect of causing clients to refinance mortgage loans faster than anticipated. This causes the value of assets related to the servicing rights on loans sold to be lower than originally anticipated. If this happens, we may need to write down our servicing assets faster, which would accelerate our expense and lower our earnings.\nWe consider interest rate risk one of our most significant market risks. Interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates. Consistency of our net interest revenue is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk. We employ a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage our interest rate risk including the use of an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to changing interest rates. The model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for on and off-balance sheet instruments and incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain financial assets and liabilities. Assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model. These assumptions are inherently uncertain, and as a result, the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies.\nLiquidity Risk\nCTBI is subject to liquidity risk.\nCTBI requires liquidity to meet its deposit and debt obligations as they come due and to fund loan demands. CTBI's access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance its activities or on terms that are acceptable to it could be impaired by factors that affect it specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could reduce its access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the market, difficult credit markets, or adverse regulatory actions against CTBI. CTBI's access to deposits may also be affected by the liquidity needs of its depositors. In particular, a substantial majority of CTBI's liabilities are demand, savings, interest checking, and money market deposits, which are payable on demand or upon several days' notice, while by comparison, a substantial portion of its assets are loans, which cannot be called or sold in the same time frame. To the extent that consumer confidence in other investment vehicles, such as the stock market, increases, customers may move funds from bank deposits and products into such other investment vehicles. Although CTBI historically has been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary, it might not be able to replace such funds in the future, especially if a large number of its depositors sought to withdraw their accounts, regardless of the reason. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBanking Reform\nOur business may be adversely affected by \"banking reform\" legislation.\nOn July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. This law has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading, and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act has required the adoption of a broad range of implementing rules and regulations and preparation of numerous studies and reports for Congress. Significant discretion has been given in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act are still unknown. This legislation includes, among other things: (i) changes in the manner in which the FDIC deposit insurance assessments are computed and an increase in the minimum designated reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund; (ii) authorization of interest-bearing demand deposits; (iii) requirements for capital regulations applicable to banks and bank holding companies which call for higher levels of capital; (iv) creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, responsible for the drafting of regulations for the implementation of federal consumer protection laws which affect banks and bank holding companies; (v) a permanent increase in the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks; (vi) a prohibition of certain proprietary trading and equity investment activities by banks; (vii) restrictions related to mortgage lending; (viii) allowance of de novo interstate branching; and (ix) additional corporate governance provisions relating to non-binding shareholder votes on executive compensation and rules prohibiting incentive compensation that encourages inappropriate risks.\nMany aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on CTBI. However, compliance with this law and the subsequent implementing regulations will result in additional operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOn July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve approved final rules that substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to CTBI and CTB. The FDIC subsequently approved these rules. The rules include new risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which are being phased in from 2015 to 2019, and refine the definition of what constitutes \"capital\" for purposes of calculating those ratios. Under the final rules, institutions are subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. The final rules also contain revisions to the prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions, including CTB, if their capital levels begin to show signs of weakness. These revisions took effect January 1, 2015.\nThe final rules set forth certain changes for the calculation of risk-weighted assets, which we were required to utilize beginning January 1, 2015. The standardized approach final rule utilizes an increased number of credit risk exposure categories and risk weights, and also addresses: (i) an alternative standard of creditworthiness consistent with Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act; (ii) revisions to recognition of credit risk mitigation; (iii) rules for risk weighting of equity exposures and past due loans; (iv) revised capital treatment for derivatives and repo-style transactions; and (v) disclosure requirements for top-tier banking organizations with $50 billion or more in total assets that are not subject to the \"advance approach rules\" that apply to banks with greater than $250 billion in consolidated assets. We currently satisfy the well-capitalized standards, and based on our current capital composition and levels, we anticipate that our capital ratios, on a Basel III basis, will continue to exceed the well-capitalized minimum capital requirements.\nGovernment Policies and Oversight\nOur business may be adversely affected by changes in government policies and oversight.\nThe earnings of banks and bank holding companies such as ours are affected by the policies of regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates the money supply. Among the methods employed by the Federal Reserve Board are open market operations in U.S. Government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These methods are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial and savings banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future.\nMany states and municipalities are experiencing financial stress. As a result, various levels of government have sought to increase their tax revenues through increased tax levies, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nFederal banking regulators are increasing regulatory scrutiny, and additional limitations (including those contained in the Dodd-Frank Act) on financial institutions have been proposed or adopted by regulators and by Congress. Moreover, banking regulatory agencies have increasingly over the last few years used authority under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to take supervisory or enforcement action with respect to alleged unfair or deceptive acts or practices by banks to address practices that may not necessarily fall within the scope of a specific banking or consumer finance law. The banking industry is highly regulated and changes in federal and state banking regulations as well as policies and administration guidelines may affect our practices, growth prospects, and earnings. In particular, there is no assurance that governmental actions designed to stabilize the economy and banking system will not adversely affect the financial position or results of operations of CTBI.\nFrom time to time, CTBI and/or its subsidiaries may be involved in information requests, reviews, investigations, and proceedings (both formal and informal) by various governmental agencies and law enforcement authorities regarding our respective businesses. Any of these matters may result in material adverse consequences to CTBI and its subsidiaries, including adverse judgements, findings, limitations on merger and acquisition activity, settlements, fines, penalties, orders, injunctions, and other actions. Such adverse consequences may be material to the financial position of CTBI or its results of operations.\nIn particular, consumer products and services are subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to compliance with consumer laws and regulations. We may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations, enforcement actions, and litigation in the future related to consumer practices. In addition, any required changes to our business operations resulting from these developments could result in a significant loss of revenue, require remuneration to customers, trigger fines or penalties, limit the products or services we offer, require us to increase certain prices and therefore reduce demand for our products, impose additional compliance costs on us, cause harm to our reputation, or otherwise adversely affect our consumer business.\nCredit Risk\nOur earnings and reputation may be adversely affected if we fail to effectively manage our credit risk.\nOriginating and underwriting loans are integral to the success of our business. This business requires us to take \"credit risk,\" which is the risk of losing principal and interest income because borrowers fail to repay loans. Collateral values and the ability of borrowers to repay their loans may be affected at any time by factors such as:\n\u00b7\nThe length and severity of downturns in the local economies in which we operate or the national economy;\n\u00b7\nThe length and severity of downturns in one or more of the business sectors in which our customers operate, particularly the automobile, hotel/motel, coal, and residential development industries; or\n\u00b7\nA rapid increase in interest rates.\nOur loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss.\nWe originate commercial real estate loans, construction and development loans, consumer loans, and residential mortgage loans, primarily within our market area. Commercial real estate, commercial, and construction and development loans tend to involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers and are most susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle. These loans also have historically had a greater credit risk than other loans for the following reasons:\n\u00b7\nCommercial Real Estate Loans. Repayment is dependent on income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. As of December 31, 2015, commercial real estate loans, including multi-family loans, comprised approximately 39% of our total loan portfolio.\n\u00b7\nOther Commercial Loans. Repayment is generally dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower's business. In addition, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, be difficult to appraise, be illiquid, or fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. As of December 31, 2015, other commercial loans comprised approximately 13% of our total loan portfolio.\n\u00b7\nConstruction and Development Loans. The risk of loss is largely dependent on our initial estimate of whether the property's value at completion equals or exceeds the cost of property construction and the availability of take-out financing. During the construction phase, a number of factors can result in delays or cost overruns. If our estimate is inaccurate or if actual construction costs exceed estimates, the value of the property securing our loan may be insufficient to ensure full repayment when completed through a permanent loan, sale of the property, or by seizure of collateral. As of December 31, 2015, construction and development loans comprised approximately 5% of our total loan portfolio.\nConsumer loans may carry a higher degree of repayment risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly when the consumer loan is unsecured. Repayment of a consumer loan typically depends on the borrower's financial stability, and it is more likely to be affected adversely by job loss, illness, or personal bankruptcy. Economic conditions in the coal industry could result in increases in unemployment in many of our market areas, which is likely to impact the repayment risk associated with our consumer loans. In addition, federal and state bankruptcy, insolvency, and other laws may limit the amount we can recover when a consumer client defaults. As of December 31, 2015, consumer loans comprised approximately 18% of our total loan portfolio.\nA significant part of our lending business is focused on small to medium-sized business which may be impacted more severely during periods of economic weakness.\nA significant portion of our commercial loan portfolio is tied to small to medium-sized businesses in our markets. During periods of economic weakness, small to medium-sized businesses may be impacted more severely than larger businesses. As a result, the ability of smaller businesses to repay their loans may deteriorate, particularly if economic challenges persist over a period of time, and such deterioration would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nA large percentage of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, in particular commercial real estate. Weakness in the real estate market or other segments of our loan portfolio would lead to additional losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, approximately 69% of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, 39% of which is commercial real estate. High levels of commercial and consumer delinquencies or declines in real estate market values could require increased net charge-offs and increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.\nOur level of other real estate owned remains above our historical norm, primarily as a result of foreclosures. To the extent that we continue to hold a higher level of real estate owned, related real estate expense will likely remain high.\nDuring the recent economic downturn, we experienced an increase in nonperforming real estate loans. As a result, we have experienced, and we continue to experience, an increased level of foreclosed properties. Foreclosed real estate expense consists of maintenance costs, taxes, valuation adjustments to appraisal values, and gains or losses on disposition. The amount that we may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including but not limited to: (i) general and local economic conditions; (ii) neighborhood values; (iii) interest rates; (iv) real estate tax rates; (v) operating expenses of the properties; (vi) environmental remediation liabilities; (vii) ability to obtain and maintain occupancy of the properties; (viii) zoning laws; (ix) governmental rules, regulations, and fiscal policies; (x) potential vandalism; and (xi) acts of God. Expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, such as real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs, may adversely affect income from the real estate. The cost of operating real property may exceed the income earned from the property, and we may need to advance funds in order to protect our investment in the property, or we may be required to dispose of the property at a loss. If our levels of other real estate owned increase or are sustained and local real estate values decline, our foreclosed real estate expense will increase, which would adversely impact our results of operations.\nEnvironmental Liability Risk\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activity.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property's value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition\nStrong competition within our market area may reduce our ability to attract and retain deposits and originate loans.\nWe face competition both in originating loans and in attracting deposits. Competition in the financial services industry is intense. We compete for clients by offering excellent service and competitive rates on our loans and deposit products. The type of institutions we compete with include commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies and brokerage and investment banking firms. Competition arises from institutions located within and outside our market areas. As a result of their size and ability to achieve economies of scale, certain of our competitors offer a broader range of products and services than we offer. The recent economic crisis is likely to result in increased consolidation in the financial industry and larger financial institutions may strengthen their competitive positions. In addition, to stay competitive in our markets we may need to adjust the interest rates on our products to match the rates offered by our competitors, which could adversely affect our net interest margin. As a result, our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market areas while achieving our investment objectives.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing consumers to complete financial transactions through alternative methods to those which historically involved banks. For example, consumers can now hold funds that would have been held as bank deposits in mutual funds, brokerage accounts, or general purpose reloadable prepaid cards. In addition, consumers can complete transactions, such as paying bills or transferring funds, directly without utilizing the services of a bank. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries (known as disintermediation), could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of deposits and the income that might be generated from those deposits. The related revenue reduction could adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nAcquisition Risk\nWe may have difficulty in the future continuing to grow through acquisitions.\nWe may experience difficulty in making acquisitions on acceptable terms due to the decreasing number of suitable acquisition targets, competition for attractive acquisitions, regulatory impediments, and certain limitations on interstate acquisitions.\nAny future acquisitions or mergers by CTBI or its banking subsidiary are subject to approval by the appropriate federal and state banking regulators. The banking regulators evaluate a number of criteria in making their approval decisions, such as:\n\u00b7\nSafety and soundness guidelines;\n\u00b7\nCompliance with all laws including the USA Patriot Act, the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations promulgated under such Act or the Exchange Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and all other applicable fair lending and consumer protection laws and other laws relating to discriminatory business practices; and\n\u00b7\nAnti-competitive concerns with the proposed transaction.\nIf the banking regulators or a commenter on our regulatory application raise concerns about any of these criteria at the time a regulatory application is filed, the banking regulators may deny, delay, or condition their approval of a proposed transaction. As more fully described under \"Results of Operations and Financial Condition\" in Item 7, the resolution of a Federal Reserve investigation in 2014 has resulted in impediments to CTBI's merger and acquisition activity for an unspecified period of time.\nWe have grown, and, subject to regulatory approval, intend to continue to grow, through acquisitions of banks and other financial institutions. After these acquisitions, we may experience adverse changes in results of operations of acquired entities, unforeseen liabilities, asset quality problems of acquired entities, loss of key personnel, loss of clients because of change of identity, difficulties in integrating data processing and operational procedures, and deterioration in local economic conditions. These various acquisition risks can be heightened in larger transactions.\nIntegration Risk\nWe may not be able to achieve the expected integration and cost savings from our bank acquisition activities.\nWe have a long history of acquiring financial institutions and, subject to regulatory approval, we expect this acquisition activity to continue in the future. Difficulties may arise in the integration of the business and operations of the financial institutions that agree to merge with and into CTBI and, as a result, we may not be able to achieve the cost savings and synergies that we expect will result from the merger activities. Achieving cost savings is dependent on consolidating certain operational and functional areas, eliminating duplicative positions and terminating certain agreements for outside services. Additional operational savings are dependent upon the integration of the banking businesses of the acquired financial institution with that of CTBI, including the conversion of the acquired entity's core operating systems, data systems and products to those of CTBI and the standardization of business practices. Complications or difficulties in the conversion of the core operating systems, data systems, and products of these other banks to those of CTBI may result in the loss of clients, damage to our reputation within the financial services industry, operational problems, one-time costs currently not anticipated by us, and/or reduced cost savings resulting from the merger activities.\nOperational Risk\nAn extended disruption of vital infrastructure or a security breach could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur operations depend upon, among other things, our infrastructure, including equipment and facilities. Extended disruption of vital infrastructure by fire, power loss, natural disaster, telecommunications failure, computer hacking or viruses, terrorist activity or the domestic and foreign response to such activity, or other events outside of our control could have a material adverse impact on the financial services industry as a whole and on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition in particular. Our business recovery plan may not work as intended or may not prevent significant interruption of our operations. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in the loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nThird party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure, such as processing, internet connections, and network access. While CTBI has selected these third party vendors carefully through its vendor management process, it does not control their actions and generally is not able to obtain satisfactory indemnification provisions in its third party vendor written contracts. Any problems caused by third parties or arising from their services, such as disruption in service, negligence in the performance of services or a breach of customer data security with regard to the third parties' systems, could adversely affect our ability to deliver services, negatively impact our business reputation, cause a loss of customers, or result in increased expenses, regulatory fines and sanctions, or litigation.\nMarket Risk\nCommunity Trust Bancorp, Inc.'s stock price is volatile.\nOur stock price has been volatile in the past, and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These factors include:\n\u00b7\nActual or anticipated variations in earnings;\n\u00b7\nChanges in analysts' recommendations or projections;\n\u00b7\nCTBI's announcements of developments related to our businesses;\n\u00b7\nOperating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers;\n\u00b7\nNew technology used or services offered by traditional and non-traditional competitors;\n\u00b7\nNews reports of trends, concerns, and other issues related to the financial services industry; and\n\u00b7\nAdditional governmental policies and enforcement of current laws.\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to CTBI's performance. Although investor confidence in financial institutions has strengthened, the financial crisis adversely impacted investor confidence in the financial institutions sector. General market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices.\nTechnology Risk\nCTBI continually encounters technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nCyber Risk\nA breach in the security of our systems could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, and create significant financial and legal exposure for us.\nOur businesses are dependent on our ability and the ability of our third party service providers to process, record, and monitor a large number of transactions. If the financial, accounting, data processing, or other operating systems and facilities fail to operate properly, become disabled, experience security breaches, or have other significant shortcomings, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nAlthough we and our third party service providers devote significant resources to maintain and upgrade our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of computer systems, software, networks, and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information belonging to us and our customers, there is no assurance that our security systems and those of our third party service providers will provide absolute security. Financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks, and other means. Despite our efforts and those of our third party service providers to ensure the integrity of these systems, it is possible that we or our third party service providers may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources.\nA successful breach of the security of our systems or those of our third party service providers could cause serious negative consequences to us, including significant disruption of our operations, misappropriation of our confidential information or the confidential information of our customers, or damage to our computers or operating systems, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss in confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. While we maintain insurance coverage that should, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of our cyber risks, this insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses we could experience resulting from a cyber security breach.\nWe could incur increased costs or reductions in revenue or suffer reputational damage in the event of misuse of information.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks regarding our customers and their accounts. To provide these products and services, we use information systems and infrastructure that we and third party service providers operate. As a financial institution, we also are subject to and examined for compliance with an array of data protection laws, regulations, and guidance, as well as to our own internal privacy and information security policies and programs.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions like us have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, and other external parties. Our technologies and systems may become the target of cyber-attacks or other attacks that could result in the misuse or destruction of our or our customers' confidential, proprietary, or other information or that could result in disruptions to the business operations of us or our customers or other third parties. Also, our customers, in order to access some of our products and services, may use personal computers, smart mobile phones, tablet PCs, and other devices that are beyond our controls and security systems. Further, a breach or attack affecting one of our third-party service providers or partners could impact us through no fault of our own. In addition, because the methods and techniques employed by perpetrators of fraud and others to attack systems and applications change frequently and often are not fully recognized or understood until after they have been launched, we and our third-party service providers and partners may be unable to anticipate certain attack methods in order to implement effective preventative measures.\nWhile we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible security breach of our information systems, if unauthorized persons were somehow to get access to confidential or proprietary information in our possession or to our proprietary information, it could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems that could materially adversely affect our business.\nCounterparty Risk\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect CTBI.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional counterparties. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 11844, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CTBI"}
