{"cik": "56047", "company": "KIRBY CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this annual report, the following risk factors should be considered carefully when evaluating the Company, as its businesses, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The following discussion does not attempt to cover factors, such as trends in the United States and global economies or the level of interest rates, among others, that are likely to affect most businesses.\nMarine Transportation Segment Risk Factors\nThe Inland Waterway infrastructure is aging and may result in increased costs and disruptions to the Company\u2019s marine transportation segment. Maintenance of the United States inland waterway system is vital to the Company\u2019s operations. The system is composed of over 12,000 miles of commercially navigable waterway, supported by over 240 locks and dams designed to provide flood control, maintain pool levels of water in certain areas of the country and facilitate navigation on the inland river system. The United States inland waterway infrastructure is aging, with more than half of the locks over 50 years old. As a result, due to the age of the locks, scheduled and unscheduled maintenance outages may be more frequent in nature, resulting in delays and additional operating expenses. Currently, 35% of the cost of new construction and major rehabilitation of locks and dams is paid by marine transportation companies through a 29 cent per gallon diesel fuel tax and the remaining 65% of waterway infrastructure and improvement is paid from general federal tax revenues. Failure of the federal government to adequately fund infrastructure maintenance and improvements in the future would have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products for its customers on a timely basis. In addition, any additional user taxes that may be imposed in the future to fund infrastructure improvements would increase the Company\u2019s operating expenses.\nThe Company could be adversely impacted by a marine accident or spill event. A marine accident or spill event could close a portion of the inland waterway system or a coastal area of the United States for an extended period of time. Although statistically marine transportation is the safest means of surface transportation of bulk commodities, accidents do occur, both involving Company equipment and equipment owned by other marine operators.\nThe Company transports a wide variety of petrochemicals, black oil, refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals throughout the Mississippi River System, on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, and coastwise along all three United States coasts. The Company manages its exposure to losses from potential unauthorized discharges of pollutants through the use of well-maintained and equipped tank barges and towing vessels, through safety, training and environmental programs, and through the Company\u2019s insurance program, but a discharge of pollutants by the Company could have an adverse effect on the Company. Risks may arise for which the Company may not be insured. Claims covered by insurance are subject to deductibles, the aggregate amount of which could be material, and certain policies impose limitations on coverage. Existing insurance coverage may not be able to be renewed at commercially reasonable rates or coverage capacity for certain risks may not be available or adequate to cover future claims. If a loss occurs that is partially or completely uninsured, or the carrier is unable or unwilling to cover the claim, the Company could be exposed to liability.\nThe Company\u2019s marine transportation segment is dependent on its ability to adequately crew its towing vessels. The Company\u2019s vessels are crewed with employees who are licensed or certified by the USCG, including its captains, pilots, engineers and tankermen. The success of the Company\u2019s marine transportation segment is dependent on the Company\u2019s ability to adequately crew its vessels. As a result, the Company invests significant resources in training its crews and providing crew members an opportunity to advance from a deckhand to the captain of a Company towboat or tugboat. Inland crew members generally work rotations such as 20 days on, 10 days off rotation, or a 30 days on, 15 days off rotation. For the coastal fleet, crew members are generally required to work rotations such as 14 days on, 14 days off rotation, a 21 days on, 21 days off rotation or a 30 days on, 30 days off rotation, dependent upon the location. The nature of crewmember work schedules and assignments away from home for extended periods require special recruiting and at times it can be difficult to find candidates. With ongoing retirements and competitive labor pressure in the marine transportation segment, the Company continues to monitor and implement market competitive pay practices. The Company also utilizes an internal development program to train Maritime Academy graduates for vessel leadership positions.\nThe Company\u2019s marine transportation segment has approximately 3,160 employees, of which approximately 2,485 are vessel crew members. None of the segment\u2019s inland operations are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The segment\u2019s coastal operations include approximately 500 vessel employees, of whom approximately 330 are subject to collective bargaining agreements in certain geographic areas. Any work stoppages or labor disputes could adversely affect coastal operations in those areas. While the COVID-19 Delta and Omicron variants have caused some crewing issues, to date, the Company has been able to manage its operations with only limited vessel delays and disruption of services, including some loss of revenue and incremental costs in the Company's inland and coastal businesses. The Company continues to update its protocols relating to management of COVID-19 and provide related employee education as new information and guidance becomes available.\nThe Company\u2019s marine transportation segment is subject to the Jones Act. The Company\u2019s marine transportation segment competes principally in markets subject to the Jones Act, a federal cabotage law that restricts domestic marine transportation in the United States to vessels built and registered in the United States, and manned, owned and operated by United States citizens. The Company presently\nmeets all of the requirements of the Jones Act for its owned and operated vessels. The loss of Jones Act status could have a significant negative effect on the Company. The requirements that the Company\u2019s vessels be United States built and manned by United States citizens, the crewing requirements and material requirements of the USCG, and the application of United States labor and tax laws increases the cost of United States flagged vessels compared to comparable foreign flagged vessels. The Company\u2019s business could be adversely affected if the Jones Act or international trade agreements or laws were to be modified or waived as to permit foreign flagged vessels to operate in the United States as these vessels are not subject to the same United States government imposed regulations, laws, and restrictions. Since the events of September 11, 2001, the United States government has taken steps to increase security of United States ports, coastal waters and inland waterways. The Company believes that it is unlikely that the current cabotage provisions of the Jones Act would be eliminated or significantly modified in a way that has a material adverse impact on the Company in the foreseeable future.\nThe Secretary of Homeland Security is vested with the authority and discretion to waive the Jones Act to such extent and upon such terms as the Secretary may prescribe whenever the Secretary deems that such action is necessary in the interest of national defense. On September 8, 2017, following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the Department of Homeland Security issued a waiver of the Jones Act for a 7-day period for shipments from New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Louisiana to South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Puerto Rico. The waiver was specifically tailored to address the transportation of refined petroleum products due to disruptions in hurricane-affected areas. On September 11, 2017, the waiver was extended for 11 days and expanded to include additional states. Following Hurricane Maria, on September 28, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security issued a waiver of the Jones Act for movement of products shipped from United States coastwise points to Puerto Rico through October 18, 2017. Two limited waivers of the Jones Act were granted in connection with the shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline in May 2021. Waivers of the Jones Act, whether in response to natural disasters or otherwise, could result in increased competition from foreign tank vessel operators, which could negatively impact the marine transportation segment.\nThe Company\u2019s marine transportation segment is subject to extensive regulation by the USCG, federal laws, other federal agencies, various state laws, the laws of other countries when operating in their waters, and certain international conventions, as well as numerous environmental regulations. The majority of the Company\u2019s vessels are subject to inspection by the USCG and carry certificates of inspection. The crews employed by the Company aboard vessels are licensed or certified by the USCG. The Company's marine transportation operations are subject to laws of other countries when operating in their waters. The Company is required by various governmental agencies to obtain licenses, certificates and permits for its owned and operated vessels. The Company\u2019s operations are also affected by various United States and state regulations and legislation enacted for protection of the environment. The Company incurs significant expenses and capital expenditures to comply with applicable laws and regulations and any significant new regulation or legislation, including climate change laws or regulations, could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s marine transportation segment is subject to natural gas and crude oil prices as well as the volatility of their prices as well as the volatility in production of refined products and petrochemicals in the United States. For 2021, 50% of the marine transportation segment\u2019s revenues were from the movement of petrochemicals, including the movement of raw materials and feedstocks from one refinery or petrochemical plant to another, as well as the movement of more finished products to end users and terminals for export. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and petrochemical and refinery plant shutdowns, 2020 and 2021 petrochemical and refined products volumes decreased relative to 2019. Volumes began to recover in 2021 as economic activity improved. The United States petrochemical industry continues to benefit from a low-cost domestically produced natural gas feedstock advantage, producing strong volumes of raw materials and intermediate products for transportation between Gulf Coast petrochemical plants and the transportation of more finished products to terminals for both domestic consumers and for export destinations. In addition, nine new United States petrochemical projects, including expansion of existing plants, are scheduled to be completed during 2022, which should provide additional movements for the marine transportation segment. These increases are partially offset by a reduction in United States refining capacity since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2020, five refineries with a combined capacity of approximately 800,000 barrels per day were closed, of which three have been or are being converted to produce renewable diesel. In 2021, an additional refinery with a capacity of approximately 255,000 barrels per day was closed as a result of damages incurred from Hurricane Ida. Higher natural gas and crude oil prices are generally better for the Company\u2019s businesses; however, higher natural gas prices and other factors could negatively impact the United States petrochemical industry and its production volumes, which could negatively impact the Company.\nDemand for tank barge transportation services is driven by the production of volumes of the bulk liquid commodities such as petrochemicals, black oil and refined petroleum products that the Company transports by tank barge. This production can depend on the prevailing level of natural gas and crude oil prices, as well as the volatility of their prices. In general, lower energy prices are good for the United States economy and typically translate into increased petrochemical and refined product demand and therefore increased demand for tank barge transportation services. However, during 2016 and 2017 lower crude oil prices resulted in a decline in domestic crude oil and natural gas condensate production and reduced volumes to be transported by tank barge. The Company estimates that at the beginning of 2015 there were approximately 550 inland tank barges and 35 coastal tank barges in the 195,000 barrels or less category transporting crude oil and natural gas condensate. By the end of 2019, the Company estimates that number of tank barges had declined to 335 inland tank barges and approximately five coastal tank barges transporting crude and natural gas condensate. During 2020, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and oil price volatility resulted in a sharp decrease in volumes of crude and natural gas condensate being transported. As of the end of 2020, the Company estimates that approximately 100 to 150 inland tank barges and one coastal tank barge were transporting crude and natural gas condensate and at the end of 2021, approximately 160 to 170 inland tank barges and one coastal tank barge were transporting crude and natural gas condensate. Volatility in the price of natural gas and crude oil can also result in heightened uncertainty which may lead to decreased production and delays in new petrochemical and refinery plant construction. Increased competition for available black oil and petrochemical barge moves caused by reduced crude oil and natural gas condensate production could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s marine transportation segment including as a result of lower spot and term contract rates and/or reluctance to enter into or extend term contracts.\nThe Company\u2019s marine transportation segment could be adversely impacted by the construction of tank barges by its competitors. At the present time, there are an estimated 4,000 inland tank barges in the United States, of which the Company operates 1,025, or 26%. The number of tank barges peaked at an estimated 4,200 in 1982, slowly declined to 2,750 by 2003, and then gradually increased to an estimated 3,850 by the end of 2015 and 2016 and remained relatively flat since 2015. For 2019, the Company estimated that industry-wide 150 new tank barges were placed in service, of which none were by the Company, and 100 tank barges were retired, 17 of which were by the Company. For 2020, the Company estimated that industry-wide approximately 150 new tank barges were placed in service, six of which were purchased by the Company from another operator, and approximately 150 tank barges were retired, 95 of which were by the Company. For 2021, the Company estimated that industry-wide 70 new tank barges were placed in service, of which none were by the Company, and 90 tank barges were retired, 36 of which were by the Company. The Company estimates that approximately 5 to 10 new tank barges have currently been ordered for delivery in 2022 and expects a number of older tank barges will be retired, dependent on 2022 market conditions.\nThe long-term risk of an oversupply of inland tank barges may be mitigated by the fact that the inland tank barge industry has approximately 385 tank barges that are 30 years old or older and approximately 280 of those are 40 years old or older. Given the age profile of the industry inland tank barge fleet and extensive customer vetting standards, the expectation is that these older tank barges will continue to be removed from service and replaced by new tank barges as needed, with the extent of both retirements and new builds dependent on petrochemical and refinery production levels and crude oil and natural gas condensate movements, both of which can have a direct effect on industry-wide tank barge utilization, as well as term and spot contract rates.\nDuring 2019, 2020, and 2021, a decline in industry-wide demand for the movement of crude oil and natural gas condensate transportation volumes increased available capacity and resulted in some reluctance among certain customers to extend term contracts, which led to an increase in the number of coastal vessels operating in the spot market. In addition, the Company and the industry added new coastal tank barge capacity during 2019, 2020, and 2021. Much of this new capacity is replacement capacity for older vessels anticipated to be retired.\nThe Company estimates there are approximately 270 tank barges operating in the 195,000 barrels or less coastal industry fleet, the sector of the market in which the Company operates, and approximately 20 of those are over 25 years old. The Company is aware of two coastal ATBs placed in service in 2019, one in 2020, and one small specialized coastal ATB in 2021 by competitors. There was one announced small specialized coastal ATB delivered in the first quarter of 2021, with no further coastal barges currently under construction.\nHigher fuel prices could increase operating expenses and fuel price volatility could reduce profitability. The cost of fuel during 2021 was approximately 11% of marine transportation revenue. The Company's marine transportation term contracts typically include fuel escalation clauses, or the customer pays for the fuel. However, there is generally a 30 to 90 day delay before contracts are adjusted depending on the specific contract. In general, the fuel escalation clauses are effective over the long-term in allowing the Company to adjust to changes in fuel costs due to fuel price changes; however, the short-term effectiveness of the fuel escalation clauses can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, specific terms of the fuel escalation formulas, fuel price volatility, navigating conditions, tow sizes, trip routing, and the location of loading and discharge ports that may result in the Company over or under recovering its fuel costs. The Company\u2019s spot contract rates generally reflect current fuel prices at the time the contract is signed but do not have escalators for fuel.\nSignificant increases in the construction cost of tank barges and towing vessels may limit the Company\u2019s ability to earn an adequate return on its investment in new tank barges and towing vessels. The price of steel, economic conditions, and supply and demand dynamics can significantly impact the construction cost of new tank barges and towing vessels. Over the last 20 years, the Company\u2019s average construction price for a new 30,000 barrel capacity inland tank barge has fluctuated up or down significantly. For example, the average construction price for a new 30,000 barrel capacity tank barge in 2009 was approximately 90% higher than in 2000, with increases primarily related to higher steel costs. During 2009, the United States and global recession negatively impacted demand levels for inland tank barges and as a result, the construction price of inland tank barges fell significantly in 2010, primarily due to a significant decrease in steel prices, as well as a decrease in the number of tank barges ordered. During 2020, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, steel costs dropped, however, during 2021, steel prices rose above 2019 levels. These increases in steel costs and improvement in supply\nand demand dynamics resulted in construction prices for a new 30,000 barrel tank barge increasing compared to prices in 2017 when there was an industry-wide over-capacity of inland tank barges in the market.\nThe Company\u2019s marine transportation segment could be adversely impacted by the failure of the Company\u2019s shipyard vendors to deliver new vessels according to contractually agreed delivery schedules and terms. The Company contracts with shipyards to build new vessels and currently has many vessels under construction. Construction projects are subject to risks of delay and cost overruns, resulting from shortages of equipment, materials and skilled labor; lack of shipyard availability; unforeseen design and engineering problems; work stoppages; weather interference; unanticipated cost increases; unscheduled delays in the delivery of material and equipment; and financial and other difficulties at shipyards including labor disputes, shipyard insolvency and inability to obtain necessary certifications and approvals. A significant delay in the construction of new vessels or a shipyard\u2019s inability to perform under the construction contract could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to fulfill contract commitments and to realize timely revenues with respect to vessels under construction. Significant cost overruns or delays for vessels under construction could also adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. To date, the Company has not experienced significant shipyard delays associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including at its subsidiary, San Jac.\nThe Company is subject to competition in its marine transportation segment. The inland and coastal tank barge industry remains very fragmented and competitive. The Company\u2019s primary competitors are noncaptive inland tank barge operators and coastal operators. The Company also competes with companies who operate refined product and petrochemical pipelines, railroad tank cars and tractor-trailer tank trucks. Increased competition from any significant expansion of or additions to facilities or equipment by the Company\u2019s competitors could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations. In addition, the Company\u2019s failure to adhere to its safety, reliability and performance standards may impact its ability to retain current customers or attract new customers.\nDistribution and Services Segment Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s distribution and services segment could be adversely impacted by future legislation, executive or other governmental orders, or additional regulation of oil and gas extraction, including hydraulic fracturing practices. The Company, through its United and S&S subsidiaries, is a distributor and service provider of engine and transmission related products for the oil and gas services, power generation and transportation industries, and a manufacturer of oilfield service equipment, including pressure pumping units. The EPA is studying hydraulic fracturing practices, and legislation may be enacted by Congress that would authorize the EPA to impose additional regulations on hydraulic fracturing. In addition, a number of states have adopted or are evaluating the adoption of legislation or regulations governing hydraulic fracturing or byproducts of the fracturing process. On January 20, 2021, the Biden Administration issued a number of executive orders related to environmental matters that could affect the operations of the Company's customers, including an Executive Order on \"Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis\" seeking to adopt new regulations and policies to address climate change and suspend, revise, or rescind prior agency actions that are identified as conflicting with the Biden Administration's climate policies. Among the areas that could be affected by the review are regulations addressing methane emissions and the part of the extraction process known as hydraulic fracturing. Various legislative and regulatory initiatives have been proposed that, if passed, could limit or discourage future production of oil and gas. Federal or state legislation, executive or governmental orders, and/or regulations could materially impact customers\u2019 operations and greatly reduce or eliminate demand for the Company\u2019s pressure pumping fracturing equipment and related products. The Company is unable to predict whether future legislation or any other regulations will ultimately be enacted and, if so, the impact on the Company\u2019s distribution and services segment.\nThe Company\u2019s distribution and services segment could be adversely impacted by the construction of pressure pumping units by its competitors. In early 2015, an estimated 21 million horsepower of pressure pumping units were working, or available to work, in North America. By late 2016, the working horsepower in North America had declined to an estimated 6 million, with an estimated 2 million horsepower scrapped, an estimated 2 million horsepower available for work and an estimated 12.5 million horsepower stacked, the large majority of which would require major service before being placed back in service. A significant drop in demand due to the low price of crude oil resulted in an oversupply in the pressure pumping market and negatively impacted the Company\u2019s 2015 and 2016 results of operations. During 2017 and 2018, with the stabilization of crude oil prices in the $40 to $70 per barrel range, the United States land rig count improved and service intensity in the well completion business increased. As a result, the Company experienced a healthy rebound in service demand during 2018, particularly with pressure pumping unit remanufacturing and transmission overhauls, and with the acquisition of S&S in September 2017, the manufacture of oilfield service equipment, including pressure pumping units, and the sale of transmissions. At the end of 2019, an estimated 15 million horsepower of pressure pumping units were working in North America, with an estimated 6 million horsepower available to work, and 3 million horsepower stacked and in need of major repair. During 2020, a significant reduction in oilfield activity as a result of oil price volatility throughout 2019 and 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a decrease to an estimated 6 million horsepower of pressure pumping units working in North America, with an estimated 1.5 million horsepower available to work, and 12 million horsepower stacked and in need of major repair. At the end of 2021, strong commodity prices resulted in an increase to an estimated 12 million horsepower of pressure pumping units working in North America, with an estimated 8 million horsepower idled and in need of major repair. Increased expansion of, or additions to, facilities or equipment by the Company\u2019s competitors could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nPrevailing natural gas and crude oil prices, as well as the volatility of their prices, could have an adverse effect on the distribution and services segment business. Lower energy prices generally result in a decrease in the number of oil and gas wells being drilled. Oilfield service companies reduce their capital spending, resulting in decreased demand for new parts and equipment, including pressure pumping units, provided by the Company\u2019s distribution and services segment. This may also lead to order cancellations from customers or customers requesting to delay delivery of new equipment. The Company also services offshore supply vessels and offshore drillings rigs operating in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as internationally. Low energy prices may negatively impact the number of wells drilled in the Gulf of Mexico and international waters. Prolonged downturns in oil and gas prices may cause substantial declines in oilfield service and exploration expenditures and could adversely impact oil and gas manufacturing, remanufacturing, parts and distribution business. In addition, energy price volatility may also result in difficulties in the Company\u2019s ability to ramp up and ramp down production on a timely basis and, therefore, could result in an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s distribution and services segment.\nThe Company is subject to competition in its distribution and services segment. The distribution and services industry is very competitive. The segment\u2019s oil and gas market\u2019s principal competitors are independent distribution and service and oilfield manufacturing companies and other factory-authorized distributors and service centers. In addition, certain oilfield service companies that are customers of the Company also manufacture and service a portion of their own oilfield equipment. Increased competition in the distribution and services industry and continued low price of natural gas, crude oil or natural gas condensate, and resulting decline in drilling for such natural resources in North American shale formations, could result in less oilfield equipment being manufactured and remanufactured, lower rates for service and parts pricing and result in less manufacturing, remanufacturing, service and repair opportunities and parts sales for the Company. For the commercial and industrial market, the segment\u2019s primary marine diesel competitors are independent diesel services companies and other factory-authorized distributors, authorized service centers and authorized marine dealers. Certain operators of diesel powered marine equipment also elect to maintain in-house service capabilities. For power generation, the primary competitors are other independent service companies.\nLoss of a distributorship or other significant business relationship could adversely affect the Company\u2019s distribution and services segment. The Company\u2019s distribution and services segment has had a relationship with EMD, the largest manufacturer of medium-speed diesel engines, for 56 years. The Company, through Kirby Engine Systems, serves as both an EMD distributor and service center for select markets and locations for both service and parts. With the acquisition of S&S in September 2017, the Company added additional EMD exclusive distributorship rights in key states, primarily through the Central, South and Eastern areas of the United States. With the S&S acquisition, the Company became the United States distributor for EMD marine and power generation applications. Sales and service of EMD products account for approximately 3% of the Company\u2019s revenues for 2021. Although the Company considers its relationship with EMD to be strong, the loss of the EMD distributorship and service rights, or a disruption of the supply of EMD parts, could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s ability to service its customers. In 2020, with the acquisition of Convoy Servicing Company and Agility Fleet Services, LLC, the Company expanded its dealership network of Thermo King refrigeration systems for trucks, railroad cars, and other land transportation markets in Texas and Colorado. In 2021, sales and service of Thermo King products comprised approximately 6% of the Company\u2019s revenues.\nUnited and S&S have maintained continuous exclusive distribution rights for MTU and Allison since the 1940s. United and S&S are two of MTU\u2019s top five distributors of off-highway engines in North America, with exclusive distribution rights in multiple states. In addition, as distributors of Allison products, United and S&S have exclusive distribution rights in multiple key growth states. United and S&S are also the distributor for parts, service and warranty on Daimler truck engines and related equipment in multiple states. Sales and service of MTU, Allison, and Daimler products accounted for approximately 9% of the Company\u2019s revenues during 2021. Although the Company considers its relationships with MTU, Allison, and Daimler to be strong, the loss of MTU, Allison, or Daimler distributorships and service rights, or a disruption of the supply of MTU or Allison parts, could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s ability to service its customers.\nIn addition to its relationships with MTU, Allison, and Daimler, the Company also has relationships with many other distributors and parts suppliers and the loss of a distributorship and service rights, or a disruption of the supply of parts from any of these other distributors or part suppliers could also have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s ability to service its customers.\nGeneral Corporate Risk Factors\nThe Company is subject to adverse weather conditions in its marine transportation and distribution and services segments. The Company\u2019s marine transportation segment is subject to weather condition volatility. Physical impacts of climate change could have a material adverse effect on the Company's costs and operations. There has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with rising sea levels as well as extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes, drought, and snow or ice storms. Extreme weather conditions may increase the Company's costs or cause damage to its facilities, and any damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. Many of the Company's facilities are located near coastal areas or waterways where rising sea levels or flooding could disrupt the Company's operations or adversely impact its facilities. Adverse weather conditions such as high or low water on the inland waterway systems, fog and ice, tropical storms, hurricanes, and tsunamis on both the inland waterway systems and throughout the United States coastal waters can impair the operating efficiencies of the marine fleet. Such adverse\nweather conditions can cause a delay, diversion or postponement of shipments of products and are totally beyond the control of the Company. Tropical storms and hurricanes may also impact the Company\u2019s customers resulting in reduced demand for the Company\u2019s services. In addition, adverse water and weather conditions can negatively affect a towing vessel\u2019s performance, tow size, loading drafts, fleet efficiency, limit navigation periods and dictate horsepower requirements. The Company\u2019s distribution and services segment is also subject to tropical storms and hurricanes impacting its coastal locations and those of its customers as well as tornados impacting its Oklahoma facilities. The risk of flooding as a result of hurricanes and tropical storms as well as other weather events may impede travel via roadways, suspend service work, and impact deliveries and the Company\u2019s ability to fulfill orders or provide services in the distribution and services segment.\nThe Company may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses, and any inability to do so may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and hinder its ability to grow. The Company has made asset and business acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions of assets or businesses in the future that complement or expand the Company\u2019s current business. The Company may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. Even if attractive acquisition opportunities are identified, the Company may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms. The success of any completed acquisition depends on the Company\u2019s ability to integrate the acquired assets or business effectively into the Company\u2019s existing operations. The process of integrating acquired assets or businesses may involve difficulties that require a disproportionate amount of the Company\u2019s managerial and financial resources to resolve. The value of acquired assets or businesses may be negatively impacted by a variety of circumstances unknown to the Company prior to the acquisition. In addition, possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets. The Company\u2019s failure to achieve synergies, to integrate successfully the acquired businesses and assets into the Company\u2019s existing operations, or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, agreements governing the Company\u2019s indebtedness from time to time may impose certain limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to undertake acquisitions or make investments or may limit the Company\u2019s ability to incur certain indebtedness and liens, which could limit the Company\u2019s ability to make acquisitions.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), or similar local applicable anti-bribery laws, could have a negative impact on its ongoing operations. The Company\u2019s operations outside the United States require the Company to comply with both United States and international regulations. For example, in addition to any similar applicable local anti-bribery laws, the Company's operations in countries outside the United States are subject to the FCPA, which prohibits United States companies or their employees and third party representatives from providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business, direct business to any person or corporate entity, or obtain any unfair advantage. The Company has internal control policies and procedures and has implemented training and compliance programs for its employees and third party representatives with respect to the FCPA. However, the Company\u2019s policies, procedures and programs may not always protect it from reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees or third party representatives, and severe criminal or civil sanctions could be the result of violations of the FCPA or any other applicable anti-bribery law in countries where the Company does business. The Company is also subject to the risks that its employees, joint venture partners, and third party representatives outside of the United States may fail to comply with other applicable laws.\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with possible climate change legislation, regulation and international accords. Greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon emissions or energy use, have increasingly become the subject of a large amount of international, national, regional, state and local attention. Pursuant to an April 2007 decision of the United States Supreme Court, the EPA was required to consider if carbon dioxide was a pollutant that endangers public health. On December 7, 2009, the EPA issued its \u201cendangerment finding\u201d regarding greenhouse gasses under the CAA. The EPA found that the emission of six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (which is emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels), may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare. Based on this finding, the EPA defined the mix of these six greenhouse gases to be \u201cair pollution\u201d subject to regulation under the CAA. Although the EPA has stated a preference that greenhouse gas regulation be based on new federal legislation rather than the existing CAA, many sources of greenhouse gas emissions may be regulated without the need for further legislation.\nThe United States Congress has considered in the past legislation that would create an economy-wide \u201ccap-and-trade\u201d system that would establish a limit (or cap) on overall greenhouse gas emissions and create a market for the purchase and sale of emissions permits or \u201callowances.\u201d Any proposed cap-and-trade legislation would likely affect the chemical industry due to anticipated increases in energy costs as fuel providers pass on the cost of the emissions allowances, which they would be required to obtain under cap-and-trade to cover the emissions from fuel production and the eventual use of fuel by the Company or its energy suppliers. In addition, cap-and-trade proposals would likely increase the cost of energy, including purchases of diesel fuel, steam and electricity, and certain raw materials used or transported by the Company. Proposed domestic and international cap-and-trade systems could materially increase raw material and operating costs of the Company\u2019s customer base. Future environmental regulatory developments related to climate change in the United States that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could result in financial impacts on the Company\u2019s operations that cannot be predicted with certainty at this time.\nIn addition, current global trends incorporating carbon neutral policies and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions are driving decarbonization initiatives across all industries to mitigate the impact on climate change and may result in a decline in global and U.S. hydrocarbon usage. Such a decline in hydrocarbon usage (for example, as a result of an increase in electric vehicles) could result in a reduction in demand for (a) the Company\u2019s services in its marine transportation segment to the extent there is reduced demand for crude oil and other feedstocks used and the products produced by the Company\u2019s major refining customers and (b) for the Company\u2019s products and services in its distribution and services segment to the extent there is reduced demand in the exploration and production of hydrocarbons by the Company\u2019s oil and gas customers.\nLoss of a large customer could adversely affect the Company. Five marine transportation customers accounted for approximately 17% of the Company\u2019s 2021, 18% of 2020 and 19% of 2019 revenue. The Company has contracts with these customers expiring in 2022 through 2026. Three distribution and services customers accounted for approximately 6% of the Company\u2019s 2021 revenue, 3% of 2020 revenue, and 12% of 2019 revenue. Although the Company considers its relationships with these companies to be strong, the loss of any of these customers, or their inability to meet financial obligations, could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company relies on critical operating assets including information systems for the operation of its businesses, and the failure of such assets or any critical information system, including as a result of natural disasters, terrorist acts, a cybersecurity attack, or other extraordinary events, may adversely impact its businesses. The Company is dependent on its critical operating assets and technology infrastructure and must maintain and rely upon critical information systems and security of its assets for the effective and safe operation of its businesses. These assets include vessels, vessel equipment, property and facilities, as well as information systems, such as software applications, hardware equipment, and data networks and telecommunications.\nThe Company\u2019s critical assets and information systems, including the Company\u2019s proprietary vessel management computer system, are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources, including but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist acts, cybersecurity attacks, software viruses, and power failures. In addition to standard safety operating procedures, the Company has implemented measures such as business continuity plans, hurricane preparedness plans, emergency recovery processes, and security preparedness plans to protect physical assets and to recover from damage to such assets. The Company has also implemented virus protection software, intrusion detection systems and annual attack and penetration audits to protect information systems to mitigate these risks. However, the Company cannot guarantee that its critical assets or information systems cannot be damaged or compromised.\nAny damage or compromise of its critical assets or data security or its inability to use or access these critical assets and information systems could adversely impact the efficient and safe operation of its businesses, or result in the failure to safely operate its equipment, and maintain the confidentiality of data of its customers or its employees and could subject the Company to increased operating expenses or legal action, which could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nLimitations on the Company's ability to obtain, maintain, protect, or enforce its proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings, including its trade secrets could affect the Company's competitive position. The Company's distribution and services businesses rely on a variety of intellectual property rights for its product and services. The Company\u2019s intellectual property could be adversely affected by successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against it which could materially and adversely affect its competitive position. The Company may also be adversely affected when its patents are unenforceable, where claims allowed are not sufficient to protect its technology or its trade secrets are not adequately protected. The Company's failure to protect its proprietary information and any successful challenges to the Company's intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nA deterioration of the Company\u2019s credit profile, disruptions of the credit markets or higher interest rates could restrict its ability to access the debt capital markets or increase the cost of debt. Deterioration in the Company\u2019s credit profile may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to access the private or public debt markets and also may increase its borrowing costs. If the Company\u2019s credit profile deteriorates significantly its access to the debt capital markets or its ability to renew its committed lines of credit may become restricted, its cost of debt may increase, or the Company may not be able to refinance debt at the same levels or on the same terms. Because the Company relies on its ability to draw on its Revolving Credit Facility to support its operations as needed, any volatility in the credit and financial markets that prevents the Company from accessing funds on acceptable terms could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, the pricing grids on Company\u2019s Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan contain a ratings grid that includes a possible increase in borrowing rates if the Company\u2019s rating declines. Furthermore, the Company incurs interest under its Revolving Credit Facility based on floating rates. Floating rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase, which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s cash flow and results of operations. In addition, as the floating rate on certain borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is tied to LIBOR, the uncertainty regarding the future of LIBOR as well as the transition from LIBOR to an alternate benchmark rate or rates could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financing costs.\nContinuing widespread health developments, government imposed COVID-19 vaccine and/or testing mandates, and economic uncertainty resulting from the global COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In December 2019, COVID-19 surfaced in Wuhan, China. In response to the resulting pandemic, various countries, including the United States, either mandated or recommended business closures, travel restrictions or limitations, social distancing, and/or self-quarantine, among other restrictions. Additionally, various state and local governments in locations where the Company operates took similar actions. The situation continues to evolve as additional variants of the virus appear. Governments have removed, eased, reinstated, or implemented new restrictions in response to changing levels of infection and hospitalization rates. The full extent and duration of these impacts is unknown at this time, but there has been and continues to be a negative impact on the global and United States economies and supply chains, including the oil and gas industry, which has created delays and reduced demand for the Company\u2019s products and services and in some cases, resulted in delays in performance of its contracts with customers.\nThese impacts could continue to place limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to execute on its business plan and materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the Company may be exposed to legal liabilities as a result of, or arising out of, the impacts of COVID-19, such as allegations of breach of contract, failure to comply with governmental requirements, and employment related claims, among others. The Company continues to monitor the developments related to COVID-19, adapt its policies and procedures to address the situation, including its pandemic response plan and business continuity plan, and review contract and other legal risk. The Company also took steps to reduce costs. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed above, any of which could have a material effect on the Company. This situation continues to evolve and additional impacts may arise that the Company is not aware of currently.", "PERMNO": 59045, "SIC": 4400, "TIC": "KEX"}
