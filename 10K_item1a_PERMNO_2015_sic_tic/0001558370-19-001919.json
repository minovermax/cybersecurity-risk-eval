{"cik": "1476034", "company": "Metropolitan Bank Holding Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described below, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of its common and capital stock.\nA substantial portion of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio consists of CRE, multi-family real estate loans and commercial loans. These types of loans have a higher degree of risk than other types of loans.\nCRE, multi-family real estate and commercial loans are often larger and involve greater risks than other types of loans since payments on such loans are often dependent on the successful operation or development of the property or business involved. Accordingly, a downturn in the real estate market and a challenging business and economic environment may increase the Bank\u2019s risk related to CRE, multi-family real estate and commercial loans. If the cash flow from business operations is reduced, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Further, due to the larger average size of such loans and the fact that they are secured by collateral that is generally less readily-marketable as compared with other loan types, losses incurred on a small number of CRE, multi-family real estate and commercial loans could have a material adverse impact on the Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, CRE loan concentration is an area that has experienced heightened regulatory focus. Under CRE guidance issued by the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC, banks with holdings of CRE, land development, construction, and certain multi-family loans in excess of certain thresholds must employ heightened risk management practices. These loans are also subject to written policies that are required by applicable regulations and that establish certain limits and standards. Such compliance requirements may impose limitations on the Company\u2019s CRE, multi-family or construction lending, which could have material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause the Bank intends to continue to increase its commercial loans, its credit risk may increase.\nThe Bank intends to increase its originations of commercial loans, including working capital lines of credit, equipment financing, healthcare and medical receivables, documentary letters of credit and standby letters of credit. These loans generally have more risk than one-to four-family residential mortgage loans and commercial loans secured by real estate. Since repayment of commercial loans depends on the successful management and operation of borrowers\u2019 businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the local and national economy. In addition, commercial loans generally have a larger average size as compared with other loans such as residential loans, and the collateral for commercial loans is generally less readily-marketable. The Bank\u2019s plans to increase its origination of these loans could result in a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operations. An adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose the Bank to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to-four-family residential mortgage loan or a commercial real estate loan.\nAs a business operating in the financial services industry, the Bank\u2019s business and operations may be adversely affected in numerous and complex ways by weak economic conditions.\nThe Bank\u2019s business and operations, which primarily consist of lending money to customers in the form of loans, borrowing money from customers in the form of deposits and investing in securities, are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. If the U.S. economy weakens, growth and profitability from the Bank\u2019s lending, deposit and investment operations could be constrained. Uncertainty about the federal fiscal policymaking process, the medium and long-term fiscal outlook of the federal government, and future tax rates is a concern for businesses, consumers and investors in the United States. In addition, economic conditions in foreign countries, including uncertainty over the stability of the euro currency, could affect the stability of global financial markets, which could hinder U.S. economic growth. The business is also significantly affected by monetary and related policies of the U.S. federal government and its agencies. Changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond the Bank\u2019s control. Adverse economic conditions and government policy responses to such conditions could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the Bank.\nChanges in card network fees could impact operations.\nFrom time to time, the card networks increase the fees (known as interchange fees) that are charged to acquirers and that the Bank charges to its merchants. It is possible that competitive pressures will result in the Bank absorbing a portion of such increases in the future, which would its increase costs, reduce profit margin and adversely affect its business and financial condition. In addition, the card networks require certain capital requirements. An increase in the required capital level would further limit the use of capital for other purposes.\nA failure in the Bank\u2019s operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could impair its liquidity, disrupt its businesses, result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, damage its reputation and cause financial losses.\nThe Bank\u2019s business, and in particular, the debit card and cash management solutions business, is partially dependent on its ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets. These transactions, as well as the information technology services provided to clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory standards. Due to the breadth of the Bank\u2019s client base and geographical reach, developing and maintaining its operational systems and infrastructure is challenging, particularly as a result of rapidly evolving legal and regulatory requirements and technological shifts. The Bank\u2019s financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities and those of the third-party service providers upon which it depends may fail to operate properly or become disabled. This\ncould be a result of events such as a spike in transaction volume, cyber-attack or other unforeseen catastrophic events, which are wholly or partially beyond the control of the Company, and may adversely affect its ability to process these transactions or provide services.\nThe Bank could be subject to environmental risks and associated costs on its foreclosed real estate assets, which could materially and adversely affect it.\nA material portion of Bank\u2019s loan portfolio is comprised of loans collateralized by real estate. There is a risk that hazardous or toxic waste could be discovered on the properties that secure these loans. If the Bank acquires such properties as a result of foreclosure, it could be held responsible for the cost of cleaning up or removing this waste, and this cost could exceed the value of the underlying properties and materially and adversely affect it.\nThe Bank could be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions and other third parties it relies on.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Bank has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional customers. Many of these transactions expose the Bank to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, its credit risk may be exacerbated when its collateral cannot be foreclosed upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due. Furthermore, successful operation of the debit card and cash management solutions business depends on the soundness of third party processors, clearing agents and others that the Bank relies on to conduct its merchant business. Any losses resulting from such third parties could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nIf the allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, earnings could decrease.\nLoan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of their loans, and the collateral securing the payment of their loans may be insufficient to assure repayment. The Bank may experience significant credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results. Various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio are made, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, management reviews the loans and the loss and delinquency experience and evaluates economic conditions.\nThe determination of the appropriate level of allowance is subject to judgment and requires the Bank to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which are subject to material changes. If assumptions prove to be incorrect, the allowance for loan losses may not cover probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio at the date of the financial statements. Significant additions to the allowance would materially decrease net income. Non-performing loans may increase and non-performing or delinquent loans may adversely affect future performance. In addition, federal and state regulators periodically review the allowance for loan losses, the policies and procedures the Bank uses to determine the level of the allowance and the value attributed to nonperforming loans or to real estate acquired through foreclosure. Such regulatory agencies may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any significant increase in allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition. See\u201cRisk Factors - The FASB has recently issued an accounting standard update that will result in a significant change in how the Company recognizes credit losses and may have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations.\u201d\nThe occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of its information security controls or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank\u2019s operations rely on its computer systems, networks and third-party providers for the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other sensitive customer information. Under various federal and state laws, the Bank is responsible for safeguarding such information. Ensuring that the collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations can increase costs.\nAlthough the Bank takes protective measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information across all geographic and product lines, and endeavors to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of the threats continues to evolve. As a result, its computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber-attacks and other events that could have an adverse security impact. Despite the defensive measures taken to manage internal technological and operational infrastructure, these threats may originate externally from third parties such as foreign governments, organized crime and other hackers, and outsource or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or may originate internally from within the organization. Furthermore, the Bank may not be able to ensure that all of its clients, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information that they exchange with us, particularly where such information is transmitted by electronic means. Given the increasingly high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they can be discovered and rectified. In addition, the increasing reliance on technology systems and networks and the occurrence and potential adverse impact of attacks on such systems and networks, both generally and in the financial services industry, have enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyber-security threats. In particular, NYSDFS implemented heightened cybersecurity regulations in March, 2017. As these threats and government and regulatory oversight of associated risks continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend additional resources to enhance or expand upon the security measures it currently maintains.\nThe networks and systems of the Bank, its customers and certain third-party partners, such as its online banking or reporting systems, execute transactions and maintain information pertaining to the Bank and its customers. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect the Bank and its customers against fraud and security breaches and to maintain its clients\u2019 confidence. In infrequent case, breaches of information security resulting from the intentional or unintentional acts by those having or gaining access to the Bank\u2019s systems or its customers\u2019, employees\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential information, have occurred and may occur again. In addition, increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, and vulnerabilities in third-party technologies (including browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that the Bank uses to prevent fraudulent transactions and protect Bank, customer and underlying transaction data. The Bank cannot be certain that the security measures taken, including those taken by the processors, to protect this sensitive data will be successful or sufficient to protect against all current and emerging threats designed to breach its systems or those of processors. Although the Bank has developed, and continues to invest in, systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks, a breach of its systems or those of processors could result in: losses to the Bank and its customers; loss of business and/or customers; damage to its reputation; the incurrence of additional expenses (including the cost of notification to consumers, credit monitoring and forensics, and fees and fines imposed by the card networks); disruption to its business; an inability to grow its online services or other businesses; additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties, or the exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability - any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal and state regulators periodically examine the Bank\u2019s business, and the Company may be required to remediate adverse examination findings.\nThe FRB and the NYSDFS, periodically examine the Bank\u2019s business, including compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a federal banking agency were to determine that the Bank was in violation of any law or regulation; or that the Bank\u2019s financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of operations had become unsatisfactory, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, direct an increase in capital, restrict the Bank\u2019s growth, assess civil monetary penalties against officers or directors, and remove officers and directors. If it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, the Bank\u2019s deposit insurance could be terminated, and it could be placed into receivership or conservatorship. If the Bank becomes subject to any regulatory actions, there could be a material adverse impact on its business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.\nA downturn in economic conditions could cause deterioration in credit quality, which could depress net income and growth.\nThe principal economic risk associated with each class of loans is the creditworthiness of the borrower, which is affected by the strength of the relevant business market segment, local market conditions, and general economic conditions. The Bank\u2019s loan portfolio includes many real estate secured loans, demand for which may decrease during economic downturns as a result of, among other things, an increase in unemployment, a decrease in real estate values and, a slowdown in housing. If negative economic conditions develop in the New York market or the United States as a whole, the Bank could experience higher delinquencies and loan charge-offs, which would adversely affect its net income and financial condition. Furthermore, to the extent that real estate collateral is obtained through foreclosure, the costs of holding and marketing real estate collateral, as well as the ultimate values obtained from disposition, could reduce earnings and adversely affect the Bank\u2019s financial condition.\nLoan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of their loans, and the collateral securing the payment of their loans may be insufficient to assure repayment. The Bank may experience significant credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results. Various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio are made, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, management reviews the loans and the loss and delinquency experience and evaluates economic conditions.\nAs a business operating in the financial services industry, the Bank\u2019s business and operations may be adversely affected in numerous and complex ways by weak economic conditions. In addition, monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies have a significant impact on overall financial market performance.\nThe Bank\u2019s business and operations, which primarily consist of lending money to customers in the form of loans, borrowing money from customers in the form of deposits and investing in securities, are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. If the U.S. economy weakens, growth and profitability from the Bank\u2019s lending, deposit and investment operations could be constrained. In addition, economic conditions in foreign countries could affect the stability of global financial markets, which could hinder U.S. economic growth.\nUncertainty about the federal fiscal policymaking process, the medium and long-term fiscal outlook of the federal government, and future tax rates is a concern for businesses, consumers and investors in the United States. The business is also significantly affected by monetary and related policies of the U.S. federal government and its agencies. Changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond the Bank\u2019s control. Adverse economic conditions and government policy responses to such conditions could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the Bank.\nA substantial majority of the Bank\u2019s loans and operations are in New York, and therefore its business is particularly vulnerable to a downturn in the New York City economy.\nA large portion of the Bank\u2019s business is concentrated primarily in the state of New York, and in New York City in particular. A significant decline in local economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, unemployment or other factors beyond the Bank\u2019s control, would likely cause an increase in the rates of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, bankruptcies and losses in its loan portfolio. As a result, a downturn in the local economy, generally and the real estate market specifically, could significantly reduce the Bank\u2019s profitability and growth and adversely affect its financial condition.\nInterest rate shifts may reduce net interest income and otherwise negatively impact the Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe majority of the Company\u2019s banking assets are monetary in nature and subject to risk from changes in interest rates. Like most financial institutions, the Bank\u2019s earnings and cash flows depend, to a great extent, upon the level of its net interest income (the difference between the interest income earned on loans), investments, other interest earning assets, and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Changes in interest rates can increase or decrease net interest income, because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to market interest rate changes. The Bank\u2019s loan portfolio includes fixed rate loans and variable rate loans, which react differently to changes in interest rates.\nWhen interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income. Additionally, an increase in interest rates may, among other things, reduce the demand for loans and the Bank\u2019s ability to originate loans and decrease loan repayment rates. A decrease in the general level of interest rates may affect the Bank through, among other things, increased prepayments on its loan portfolio and increased competition for deposits. Accordingly, changes in the level of market interest rates affect the Bank\u2019s net yield on interest earning assets, loan origination volume and overall results. Although the Bank\u2019s asset-liability management strategy is designed to control and mitigate exposure to the risks related to changes in market interest rates, those rates are affected by many factors outside of its control, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, recession, changes in unemployment, the money supply, international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets.\nThe Bank\u2019s securities portfolio may be impacted by fluctuations in market value, potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income and/or earnings. Fluctuations in market value may be caused by changes in market interest rates, lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis, with more frequent evaluation for selected issues. If this evaluation shows impairment to the actual or projected cash flows associated with one or more securities, a potential loss to earnings may occur. Changes in interest rates can also have an adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s financial condition, as its available-for-sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value and, therefore, are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. The Company increases or decreases stockholders\u2019 equity by the amount of change in the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale securities, net of taxes. Declines in market value could result in other-than-temporary impairments of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on net income and capital levels. Refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Investments.\u201d\nThe Bank may be adversely impacted by the transition from LIBOR as a reference rate.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be\nviewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments.\nThe Bank has a significant number of loans, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR could create considerable costs and additional risk. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition will change the Bank\u2019s market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation. Although Management is currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank\u2019s business could suffer if there is a decline in the use of prepaid cards as a payment mechanism or if there are adverse developments with respect to the prepaid financial services industry in general.\nAs the prepaid financial services industry evolves, consumers may find prepaid financial services to be less attractive than traditional or other financial services. Consumers might not use prepaid financial services for any number of reasons, including the general perception of the industry. If consumers do not continue or increase their usage of prepaid cards, including making changes in the way prepaid cards are loaded, the Bank\u2019s operating revenues and prepaid card deposits may remain at current levels or decline. Any projected growth for the industry may not occur or may occur more slowly than estimated. If consumer acceptance of prepaid financial services does not continue to develop or develops more slowly than expected or if there is a shift in the mix of payment forms, such as cash, credit cards, traditional third-party debit cards and prepaid cards, away from the Bank\u2019s products and services, it could have a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nThe Bank operates in a highly competitive industry and faces significant competition from other financial institutions and financial services providers, many of which are larger than the Bank, which may decrease it growth or profits.\nConsumer and commercial banking as well as cash management solutions are highly competitive industries. The Bank\u2019s market area contains not only a large number of community and regional banks, but also a significant presence of the country\u2019s largest commercial banks. The Bank competes with other state and national financial institutions, savings and loan associations, savings banks and credit unions and other companies offering financial services. Some of these competitors may have a longer history of successful operations nationally and in the New York market area, greater ties to businesses, expansive banking relationships, more established depositor bases, fewer regulatory constraints, and lower cost structures than the Bank does. Competitors with greater resources may possess an advantage through their ability to maintain numerous banking locations in more convenient sites, conduct more extensive promotional and advertising campaigns, or operate a more developed technology platform. Due to their size, many competitors may offer a broader range of products and services, as well as better pricing for certain products and services than the Bank can offer. Further, increased competition among financial services companies due to the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions may adversely affect the Bank\u2019s ability to market its products and services.\nThe Bank is a community banking institution that provides banking services to the local communities in the market areas in which it operates, and therefore, its ability to diversify its economic risks is limited by its own local markets and economies. The Bank lends, primarily, to individuals and small and medium-sized businesses, which may expose it to greater lending risks than those of banks that lend to larger, better-capitalized businesses with longer operating histories. In addition, the Bank\u2019s legally mandated lending limits are lower than those of certain of its competitors that have greater capital. Lower lending limits may discourage borrowers with lending needs that exceed these limits from doing business with the Bank. The Bank may try to serve such borrowers by selling loan participations to other financial institutions; however, this strategy may not succeed.\nThe Bank faces risks related to its operational, technological and organizational infrastructure.\nThe Bank\u2019s ability to grow and compete is dependent on its ability to build or acquire the necessary operational and technological infrastructure and to manage the cost of that infrastructure as it expands. Similar to other large corporations, operational risk can manifest itself in many ways, such as errors related to failed or inadequate processes, faulty or disabled computer systems, fraud by employees or outside persons and exposure to external events. In addition, the Bank is heavily dependent on the strength and capability of its technology systems, which are used, both, to interface with customers and manage internal financial and other systems. The Bank\u2019s ability to develop and deliver new products that meet the needs of its existing customers and attract new ones depends on the functionality of its technology systems.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The Bank\u2019s future success will depend in part upon its ability to address the needs of its clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience as well as to provide secure electronic environments and create additional efficiencies in its operations as it continues to grow and expand its market area. The Bank continuously monitors its operational and technological capabilities and makes modifications and improvements when it believes it will be cost effective to do so. Many of the Bank\u2019s larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in operational and technological infrastructure. As a result, competitors may be able to offer additional or more convenient products compared to those that the Bank will be able to provide, which would put it at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe Bank also outsources some of its operational and technological infrastructure, including modifications and improvements to these systems, to third parties. If these third-party service providers experience difficulties, fail to comply with banking regulations or terminate their services and if the Bank is unable to replace them with other service providers, its operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially. Even if the Bank were able to replace the third-party providers, it may be at a higher cost, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. The Bank also faces risk from the integration of new infrastructure platforms and/or new third-party providers of such platforms into its existing businesses. The Bank\u2019s ability to run its business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations is dependent on these infrastructures.\nThe Bank is subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer or employee fraud and data processing system failures and errors.\nEmployee errors and employee and customer misconduct could subject the Bank to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and have a material adverse impact on its reputation. Misconduct by its employees could include concealing unauthorized activities, engaging in improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions the Bank takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject the Bank to financial claims for negligence.\nThe Bank maintains a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. If internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse impact on the Bank\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with existing and potential customers and counterparties, the Bank may rely on information provided by or on behalf of its existing and potential customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. The Bank also may rely on representations of existing and potential customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. In deciding whether to extend credit, the Bank may rely upon existing and potential customers\u2019 representations that their respective financial statements conform to U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. The Bank also may rely on customer and counterparty representations and certifications, or other auditors\u2019 reports, with respect to the business and financial condition of existing and potential customers and counterparties. The Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, financial reporting and reputation could be negatively affected if the Bank relies on materially misleading, false, incomplete, inaccurate or fraudulent information provided by or on behalf of existing or potential customers or counterparties.\nThe Bank relies heavily on its executive management team and other key employees and could be adversely affected by the unexpected loss of their services.\nThe Bank\u2019s success depends in large part on the performance of its key personnel, as well as on its ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified senior and middle management and other skilled employees. Competition for employees is intense, and the process of locating key personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute its business plan may be lengthy. The Bank may not be successful in retaining its key employees, and the unexpected loss of services of one or more of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on its business because of their skills, knowledge of primary markets, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. If the services of any key personnel should become unavailable for any reason, the Bank may not be able to identify and hire qualified persons on acceptable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects of the Bank.\nFurther, the Bank\u2019s ability to retain key officers and employees may be impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry. In 2016, the FRB and several other federal financial regulators revised and re-proposed rules to implement Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act Section 956 directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements, or any feature of any such arrangement, at covered financial institutions, which includes a bank or bank holding company with $1 billion or more in assets, such as the Company and the Bank, that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss. Further, the rule imposes enhanced risk management controls and governance and internal policy and procedure requirements with respect to incentive compensation. Accordingly, the Bank may be at a disadvantage to offer competitive compensation compared to other financial institutions or companies in other industries, which may not be subject to the same requirements.\nThe Bank may not be able to grow and if it does, it may have difficulty managing that growth.\nThe Bank\u2019s ability to grow depends, in part, upon its ability to expand its market share, successfully attract deposits, and identify loan and investment opportunities as well as opportunities to generate fee-based income. The Bank may not be successful in increasing the volume of loans and deposits at acceptable levels and upon terms it finds acceptable. The Bank may also not successful in expanding its operations organically or through strategic acquisition while managing the costs and implementation risks associated with this growth strategy.\nThe Bank expects to grow in the number of employees and customers and the scope of its operations, but it may not be able to sustain its historical rate of growth or continue to grow its business at all. Its success will depend upon the ability of its officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve operational and other systems, to manage multiple, concurrent customer relationships, and to hire, train and manage employees. In the event that the Bank is unable to perform all these tasks and meet these challenges effectively, including continuing to attract core deposits, its operations, and consequently its earnings, could be adversely impacted.\nAny future acquisitions will subject the Company to a variety of risks, including execution risks, failure to realize anticipated transaction benefits, and failure to overcome integration risks, which could adversely affect growth and profitability.\nThe Company plans to grow its businesses organically. Although, currently, there are no plans, arrangements or understandings to make any acquisitions in the near-term, from time to time in the future the Company may consider acquisition opportunities that it believes support its businesses and enhances profitability. In the event that it does\npursue acquisitions, the Company may have difficulty executing on acquisitions and may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated transaction benefits if the integration process takes longer or is costlier than expected or otherwise fails to meet expectations. Generally, any acquisition of target financial institutions, branches or other banking assets will require approval by, and cooperation from, a number of governmental regulatory agencies, possibly including the FRB, NYSDFS, and the FDIC. Such regulators could deny the application, which would restrict growth, or the regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to the Company.\nDepending on the condition of any institution or assets or liabilities that the Company may acquire, that acquisition may, at least in the near term, adversely affect its capital and earnings and, if not successfully integrated with the organization, may continue to have such effects over a longer period. The Company may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with potential acquisitions, and any acquisition considered will be subject to prior regulatory approval. As to any acquisition that the Company completes, it may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated transaction benefits if the integration process takes longer or is more costly than expected or otherwise fails to meet expectations.\nAdditionally, acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and, therefore, may result in some dilution of the Company\u2019s book value and net income per common share in connection with any future transaction. The Company\u2019s inability to overcome these risks could have a material adverse effect on its profitability, return on equity and return on assets, its ability to implement its business strategy and enhance stockholder value, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the Bank\u2019s enterprise risk management framework is not effective at mitigating risk and loss, it could suffer unexpected losses and its results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Bank\u2019s enterprise risk management framework seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return, which is critical to optimizing stockholder value. The Bank has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which it is subject, including credit, liquidity, operational, regulatory compliance and reputational risks. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to these risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that have not been appropriately anticipated or identified. If the Bank\u2019s risk management framework proves ineffective, it could suffer unexpected losses and its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in accounting standards could materially impact the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) or the SEC may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements. Such changes may result in it being subject to new or changing accounting and reporting standards. In addition, the bodies that interpret the accounting standards (such as banking regulators, outside auditors or management) may change their interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes may be beyond the Company\u2019s control, can be hard to predict, and can materially impact how it records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, or apply an existing standard differently, also retrospectively, in each case resulting in it needing to revise or restate prior period financial statements. For more information on changes in accounting standards, see Note 3 to the audited financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting estimates and risk management processes and controls rely on analytical and forecasting techniques and models and assumptions, which may not accurately predict future events.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how it records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. Management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods, so they comply with GAAP and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report financial condition and results. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet\nwhich may result in the reporting of materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCertain accounting policies are critical to presenting the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. These critical accounting policies include the allowance for loan losses and income taxes. Because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters, the Company may be required to do one or more of the following: significantly increase the allowance for loan losses or sustain loan losses that are significantly higher than the reserve provided; reduce the carrying value of an asset measured at fair value; or significantly increase accrued tax liability. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d.\nThe Company\u2019s internal controls, disclosure controls, processes and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures are based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable (not absolute) assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of controls, processes and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls, processes and procedures could necessitate changes in those controls, processes and procedures, which may increase compliance costs, divert management attention from the business or subject the Company to regulatory actions and increased regulatory scrutiny. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company.\nThe reduced disclosures and relief from certain other significant disclosure requirements that are available to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d and \u201csmaller reporting companies\u201d may result in the Company\u2019s financial statement not being comparable to the financial statements of public companies that are not allowed the same relief.\nThe Company is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act and a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d pursuant to SEC regulations. The Company intends to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that apply to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d or \u201csmaller reporting companies\u201d. The JOBS Act permits the Company an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards affecting public companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period, which means that its financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards on a non-delayed basis.\nThe Bank\u2019s ability to maintain its reputation is critical to the success of its business, and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect its performance.\nThe Bank is a community bank, and reputation is one of the most valuable components of its business. As such, the Bank strives to conduct its business in a manner that enhances its reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring, and retaining employees who share the Bank\u2019s core values of being an integral part of the communities it serves, delivering superior service to and caring about its customers. If the Bank\u2019s reputation is negatively affected by the actions of its employees or for any other reason, its business, and therefore, its operating results may be materially adversely affected. Further, negative public opinion can expose it to litigation and regulatory action as it seeks to implement its growth strategy, which would adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nA lack of liquidity could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity is essential to the Bank\u2019s business. It relies on its ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of loans to ensure that there is adequate liquidity to fund its operations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on liquidity. The Bank\u2019s most important source of funds is deposits. Deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff, which are strongly influenced by such external factors as the direction of interest rates, local and national economic conditions and competition for deposits in the markets the Bank\nserves. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments such as money market funds, the Bank would lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, which would increase its funding costs and reduce net interest income. Any changes made to the rates offered on deposit products to remain competitive with other financial institutions may also adversely affect profitability and liquidity. Further, the demand for the deposit products offered may be reduced due to a variety of factors such as demographic patterns, changes in customer preferences, reductions in consumers\u2019 disposable income, the monetary policy of the FRB, regulatory actions that decrease customer access to particular products, or the availability of competing products.\nOther primary sources of funds consist of cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, and proceeds from the issuance and sale of equity securities to investors. Additional liquidity is provided by the ability to borrow from the FHLB of New York. The Bank also has an available line of credit with FRBNY discount window. The Bank also may borrow funds from third-party lenders, such as other financial institutions. The Bank\u2019s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize its activities, or on terms that are acceptable, could be impaired by factors that affect the Bank directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. The Bank\u2019s access to funding sources could also be affected by a decrease in the level of its business activity as a result of a downturn in markets or by one or more adverse regulatory actions against it.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact the Bank\u2019s ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet expenses, or to fulfill obligations such as repaying borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on its liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be adversely affected by the highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern its operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and accounting principles, or changes in any of them.\nAs a bank holding company, the Company is subject to extensive examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies that govern almost all aspects of its operations. These laws and regulations are not intended to protect the Company\u2019s stockholders. Rather, these laws and regulations are intended to protect customers, depositors, the DIF and the overall financial stability of the U.S economy. These laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on the business activities in which the Company can engage, limit the dividend or distributions that the Bank can pay to it, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee its debt, and impose certain specific accounting requirements that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in capital than generally accepted accounting principles would require. Compliance with these laws and regulations is difficult and costly, and changes to these laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure follows good faith effort or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject the Company to restrictions on its business activities, fines and other penalties, the commencement of informal or formal enforcement actions against the Company, and other negative consequences, including reputational damage, any of which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, capital base and the price of its securities. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive.\nLikewise, the Company operates in an environment that imposes income taxes on its operations at both the federal and state levels to varying degrees. Strategies and operating routines have been implemented to minimize the impact of these taxes. Consequently, any change in tax legislation could significantly alter the effectiveness of these strategies.\nLegislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may increase the Company\u2019s costs and impact its business, governance structure, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated industry with multiple regulators and is subject to a changing regulatory environment. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposed higher capital requirements on bank holding companies, changed the base for FDIC insurance assessments from a bank\u2019s deposit base to its average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, permanently raised the current standard deposit insurance\nlimit to $250,000, and expanded the FDIC\u2019s authority to raise insurance premiums. For more information, see \u201cPart I, Item 1 \u201cBusiness - Regulation\u201d.\nCompliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations has and will continue to result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects of the Company.\nFederal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. Certain aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry, if enacted or adopted, could expose it to additional costs, including increased compliance costs; impact the profitability of the Company\u2019s business activities; require more oversight; or change certain of its business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads. These changes may also require the Company to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations and could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. With respect to the Bank, the NYSDFS, FRB, the United States Department of Justice and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity and restrictions on expansion. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nThe FASB has recently issued an accounting standard update that will result in a significant change in how the Company recognizes credit losses and may have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update, \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which replaces the current \u201cincurred loss\u201d model for recognizing credit losses with an \u201cexpected loss\u201d model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) model. Under the CECL model, the Company will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \u201cincurred loss\u201d model required under current GAAP, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, the Company expects that the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how it determines allowance for loan losses and could require it to significantly increase the allowance. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of allowance for loan losses. If the Company is required to materially increase its level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe new CECL standard will become effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the CECL model will have on its accounting; however, consistent with regulatory expectations set forth in interagency guidance issued at the end of 2016, it expects to recognize a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to allowance for loan losses as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective. The Company cannot yet determine the\nmagnitude of any such one-time cumulative adjustment or of the overall impact of the new standard on its financial condition or results of operations.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the FRB could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, the Company\u2019s earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the FRB. An important function of the FRB is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the FRB to implement these objectives are open market purchases and sales of U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in banks\u2019 reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the FRB have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nThe Bank faces a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Federal Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing statutes and regulations.\nThe BSA, the USA PATRIOT Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among others, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering compliance program and to file reports such as suspicious activity reports and currency transaction reports. The Bank\u2019s products and services, including its debit card issuing business, are subject to an increasingly strict set of legal and regulatory requirements intended to protect consumers and help detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit activities. The Bank is required to comply with these and other anti-money laundering requirements. The federal banking agencies and the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network are authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and have recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts against banks and other financial services providers with the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. The Bank is also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the regulations administered and enforced by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control. If the Bank violates these laws and regulations, or if its policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, the Bank would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on its ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of its business plan, including any acquisition plans.\nFailure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for the Bank. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe FRB may require the Company to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nFederal law requires that a bank holding company act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the \u201csource of strength\u201d doctrine, the FRB may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to a subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the holding company may not have the resources to provide it and therefore may be required to borrow the funds or raise capital. Any loans by a holding company to its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the institution\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any\nborrowing that must be done by the Company to make a required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 17093, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MCB"}
