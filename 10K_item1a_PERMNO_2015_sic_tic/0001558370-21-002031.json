{"cik": "19411", "company": "MAGELLAN HEALTH INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE CENTENE TRANSACTION\nRegulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or cannot be met.\nBefore the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, may be completed, various approvals must be obtained from regulatory authorities. These regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the granting of such approvals. Such conditions or changes and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying completion of the Merger or of imposing additional costs or limitations on the combined company following the Merger. The regulatory approvals may not be received at all, may not be received in a timely fashion, or may contain conditions on the completion of the Merger that are not anticipated or cannot be, or are not required under the Merger Agreement to be, met. If the consummation of the Merger is delayed, including by a delay in receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, the business, financial condition and results of operations of each company may also be materially and adversely affected. Please see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Regulatory Approvals\u201d in our definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on February 19, 2021 (the \u201cProxy Statement\u201d).\nFailure of the Merger to be completed, the termination of the Merger Agreement or a significant delay in the consummation of the Merger could negatively impact us.\nThe Merger Agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the Merger. Please see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Merger\u201d in the Proxy Statement. These conditions to the consummation of the Merger may not be fulfilled and, accordingly, the Merger may not be completed or may be significantly delayed. In addition, if the Merger is not completed by October 4, 2021 (as may be extended to January 4, 2022 under certain circumstances related to regulatory approvals described in the Merger Agreement), either Centene or we may choose to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time after that date if the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is not proximately caused by any breach of or failure to perform or comply with, in any material respect, any obligation under the Merger Agreement by the party electing to terminate the Merger Agreement. Furthermore, the consummation of the Merger may be significantly delayed due to various factors, including potential litigation related to the Merger.\nIf the Merger is not consummated or significantly delayed, our ongoing business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common stock may decline significantly, particularly to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be consummated. If the consummation of the Merger is delayed, including by the receipt of a competing acquisition proposal, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, we have incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. If the Merger is not completed or significantly delayed, we would have to recognize these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the Merger. Any of the foregoing, or other risks arising in connection with the failure of or delay in consummating the Merger, including the diversion of management attention from pursuing other opportunities and the constraints in the Merger Agreement on our ability to make significant changes to our ongoing business during the pendency of the Merger, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, our business may have been adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Merger, and the market price of our common stock might decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. If the Merger Agreement is terminated and our board of directors seeks an alternative transaction, our stockholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to engage in a transaction on more attractive terms than the Merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, we also may be required to pay Centene a termination fee. Please see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Termination Fees\u201d in the Proxy Statement for a description of the termination fees applicable to us.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees, customers, suppliers and vendors may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel and customers pending the consummation of the Merger, as such personnel and customers may experience uncertainty about their future roles and relationships following the consummation of the Merger. Additionally, these uncertainties could cause our customers, suppliers, vendors and others with whom we deal to seek to change, or fail to extend, existing business relationships with us. In addition, competitors may target our existing customers by highlighting potential uncertainties and integration difficulties that may result from the Merger.\nThe pursuit of the Merger and the preparation for the integration may place a burden on our management and internal resources. Any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Merger Agreement restricts us from taking certain actions without Centene\u2019s consent while the Merger is pending. If the Merger is not completed, these restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Please see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Covenants and Agreements-Conduct of Business of the Company\u201d in the Proxy Statement for a description of the restrictive covenants applicable to us.\nCertain provisions of the Merger Agreement may limit our ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that may discourage a third party from submitting an acquisition proposal to us that might result in greater value to our stockholders than the Merger, or may result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire us than it might otherwise have proposed to pay. These provisions include a general prohibition on our soliciting or, subject to certain exceptions relating to the exercise of fiduciary duties by our board of directors, entering into discussions with any third party regarding any acquisition proposal or offer for a competing transaction and a termination fee that is payable to Centene if we terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior acquisition proposal.\nLitigation against us or Centene, or the members of our or Centene\u2019s board of directors, could prevent or delay the completion of the Merger.\nWhile we and Centene believe that any claims that may be asserted by purported stockholder plaintiffs related to the Merger would be without merit, the results of any such potential legal proceedings are difficult to predict and could delay or prevent the Merger from being completed in a timely manner. Moreover, any litigation could be time consuming and expensive, could divert our and Centene\u2019s management\u2019s attention away from their regular business and any lawsuit adversely resolved against us, Centene or members of our or Centene\u2019s board of directors could have a material adverse effect on each party\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOne of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is the absence of any law or order, whether preliminary, temporary or permanent, having the effect of making the Merger illegal or otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Merger. Consequently, if a settlement or other resolution is not reached in any lawsuit that is filed or any regulatory proceeding and a claimant secures injunctive or other relief or a regulatory authority issues an order or other directive having the effect of making the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger, then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the Merger from becoming effective in a timely manner or at all.\nRISK RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nReliance on Customer Contracts-The Company\u2019s inability to renew, extend or replace expiring or terminated contracts could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity, profitability and financial condition.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s net revenue is derived from contracts that may be terminated immediately with cause and many, including some of the Company\u2019s most significant contracts, are terminable without cause by the customer upon notice and the passage of a specified period of time (typically between 60 and 180 days), or upon the occurrence of certain other specified events. The Company\u2019s ten largest customers accounted for approximately\n45.5 percent, 44.1 percent and 42.0 percent of the Company\u2019s net revenue in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Loss of all of these contracts or customers would, and loss of any one of these contracts or customers could, materially reduce the Company\u2019s net revenue and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, profitability and financial condition. See Note 2-\u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies-Significant Customers\u201d to the consolidated financial statements set forth elsewhere herein for a discussion of the Company\u2019s significant customers.\nChanges in the Medical Managed Care Carve-Out Industry-Certain changes in the business practices of this industry could negatively impact the Company\u2019s resources, profitability and results of operations.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s Healthcare and Pharmacy Management segments\u2019 net revenues from continuing operations are derived from customers in the medical managed healthcare industry, including managed care companies, health insurers and other health plans. Some types of changes in this industry\u2019s business practices could negatively impact the Company. For example, if the Company\u2019s managed care customers seek to provide services directly to their subscribers, instead of contracting with the Company for such services, the Company could be adversely affected. In this regard, certain of the Company\u2019s major customers in the past have not renewed all or part of their contracts with the Company, and instead provided managed healthcare services directly to their subscribers. In addition, the Company has a significant number of contracts with Blue Cross Blue Shield plans and other regional health plans. Consolidation of the healthcare industry through acquisitions and mergers could potentially result in the loss of contracts for the Company. In addition, in some instances state Medicaid agencies may look to procure certain services, such as pharmacy benefit management services, directly instead of contracting with a managed care company to do so, potentially reducing the amount of business opportunities from managed care customers. Any of these changes could reduce the Company\u2019s net revenue, and adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability and financial condition.\nChanges in the Contracting Model for Medicaid Contracts-Certain changes in the contracting model used by states for managed healthcare services contracts relating to Medicaid lives could negatively impact the Company\u2019s resources, profitability and results of operations.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s Healthcare segment net revenue is derived from direct contracts that it has with state or county governments for the provision of services to Medicaid enrollees. Certain states have recently contracted with managed care companies to manage both the behavioral and physical medical care of their Medicaid enrollees. If other governmental entities change the method for contracting for Medicaid business to a fully integrated model, the Company will attempt to subcontract with the managed care organizations to provide behavioral healthcare management for such Medicaid business; however, there is no assurance that the Company would be able to secure such arrangements. Accordingly, if such a change in the contracting model were to occur, it is possible that the Company could lose current contracted revenues, as well as be unable to bid on potential new business opportunities, thus negatively impacting the Company\u2019s profitability and financial condition.\nRisk-Based Products-Because the Company provides services at a fixed fee, if the Company is unable to maintain historical margins, or is unable to accurately predict and control healthcare costs, the Company\u2019s profitability could decline.\nThe Company derives its net revenue primarily from arrangements under which the Company assumes responsibility for costs of treatment in exchange for a fixed fee. The Company refers to such arrangements as \u201crisk-based contracts\u201d or \u201crisk-based products,\u201d which include EAP services. These arrangements provided 37.5 percent, 40.4 percent and 37.5 percent of the Company\u2019s net revenue from continuing operations in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.\nThe profitability of the Company\u2019s risk contracts could be reduced if the Company is unable to maintain its historical margins. The competitive environment for the Company\u2019s risk products could result in pricing pressures which cause the Company to reduce its rates. In addition, customer demands or expectations as to margin levels could cause the Company to reduce its rates. A reduction in risk rates which are not accompanied by a reduction in services covered or expected underlying care trend could result in a decrease in the Company\u2019s operating margins.\nProfitability of the Company\u2019s risk contracts could also be reduced if the Company is unable to accurately estimate the rate of service utilization by members or the cost of such services when the Company prices its services. The Company\u2019s assumptions of utilization and costs when the Company prices its services may not ultimately reflect\nactual utilization rates and costs, many aspects of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. If the cost of services provided to members under a contract together with the administrative costs exceeds the aggregate fees received by the Company under such contract, the Company will incur a loss on the contract.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability could also be reduced if the Company is required to make adjustments to estimates made in reporting historical financial results regarding cost of care, reflected in the Company\u2019s financial statements as medical claims payable. Medical claims payable includes reserves for incurred but not reported (\u201cIBNR\u201d) claims, which are claims for covered services rendered by the Company\u2019s providers which have not yet been submitted to the Company for payment. The Company estimates and reserves for IBNR claims based on past claims payment experience, including the average interval between the date services are rendered and the date the claims are received and between the date services are rendered and the date claims are paid, enrollment data, utilization statistics, adjudication decisions, authorized healthcare services and other factors. This data is incorporated into contract-specific reserve models. The estimates for submitted claims and IBNR claims are made on an accrual basis and adjusted in future periods as required.\nIf such risk-based products are not correctly underwritten, the Company\u2019s profitability and financial condition could be adversely affected. Factors that affect the Company\u2019s ability to price the Company\u2019s services, or accurately make estimates of IBNR claims and other expenses for which the Company creates reserves may include differences between the Company\u2019s assumptions and actual results arising from, among other things: changes in the delivery system; changes in utilization patterns; changes in the number of members seeking treatment; unforeseen fluctuations in claims backlogs; unforeseen increases in the costs of the services; the occurrence of catastrophes; regulatory changes; and changes in benefit plan design.\nSome of these factors could impact the ability of the Company to manage and control the medical costs to the extent assumed in the pricing of its services.\nCompetition-The competitive environment in the managed healthcare industry may limit the Company\u2019s ability to maintain or increase the Company\u2019s rates, which would limit or adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability, and any failure in the Company\u2019s ability to respond adequately may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain contracts or obtain new contracts.\nThe Company\u2019s business is highly competitive. The Company competes with other healthcare organizations as well as with insurance companies, including HMOs, PPOs, TPAs, IPAs, multi-disciplinary medical groups, PBMs, specialty pharmacy companies, radiology benefits management companies and other specialty healthcare and managed care companies. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors, particularly certain insurance companies, HMOs and PBMs are significantly larger and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than the Company, which can create downward pressure on prices through economies of scale. The entrance or expansion of these larger companies in the managed healthcare industry (including the Company\u2019s customers who have in-sourced or who may choose to in-source healthcare services) could increase the competitive pressures the Company faces and could limit the Company\u2019s ability to maintain or increase the Company\u2019s rates. If this happens, the Company\u2019s profitability could be adversely affected. In addition, if the Company does not adequately respond to these competitive pressures, it could cause the Company to not be able to maintain its current contracts or to not be able to obtain new contracts.\nProvider Agreements-Failure to maintain or to secure cost-effective healthcare provider contracts may result in a loss of membership or higher medical costs.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability depends, to an extent, upon the ability to contract favorably with certain healthcare providers. The Company may be unable to enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or under favorable terms. If the Company is unable to retain its current provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms, the Company\u2019s profitability could be reduced.\nPharmacy Management-Loss of Relationship with Providers-If we lose our relationship, or our relationship otherwise changes in an unfavorable manner, with one or more key pharmacy providers or if significant changes occur within the pharmacy provider marketplace, or if other issues arise with respect to our pharmacy networks, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur operations are dependent to a significant extent on our ability to obtain discounts on prescription purchases from retail pharmacies that can be utilized by our clients and their members. Our contracts with retail pharmacies, which\nare non-exclusive, are generally terminable by either party on short notice. If one or more of our top pharmacy chains elects to terminate its relationship with us, or if we are only able to continue our relationship on terms less favorable to us, access to retail pharmacies by our clients and their health plan members, and consequently our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nPharmacy Management-Loss of Relationship with Vendors-Our specialty pharmacies, pharmacy claims processing, and mail processing are dependent on our relationships with a limited number of vendors and suppliers and the loss of any of these relationships could significantly impact our ability to sustain our financial performance.\nWe acquire a substantial percentage of our specialty pharmacies prescription drug supply from a limited number of suppliers. Some of our agreements with these suppliers may be short-term and cancelable by either party without cause with a relatively short time-frame of prior notice. Further, certain parts of these agreements allow pricing and other terms of these relationships to be periodically adjusted based upon required service levels. A termination or modification to any of these relationships could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. An additional risk related to supply is that many products dispensed by our specialty pharmacy business are manufactured with ingredients that are susceptible to supply shortages. If any products we dispense are in short supply for long periods of time, this could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we source from a limited number of vendors certain aspects of our pharmacy claims and mail processing capabilities. An interruption of service, termination or modification to the terms to any of these agreements may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nPharmacy Management-Loss of Relationship with Manufacturers-If we lose relationships with one or more key pharmaceutical manufacturers or third-party rebate administrators or if rebate payments we receive from pharmaceutical manufacturers and rebate processing service providers decline, our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe receive fees or other compensation from our clients, in some cases based upon the retention of rebate amounts paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers or third-party rebate administrators based on the use of selected drugs by members of health plans sponsored by our clients, all pursuant to the terms of our customer contracts. In addition, pharmaceutical manufacturers often pay administrative fees to us based upon our provision of rebate administration services under agreements with such manufacturers or third-party rebate administrators. Our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected if: we lose relationships with one or more key pharmaceutical manufacturers or third-party rebate administrators; we are unable to renew or finalize rebate contracts with one or more key pharmaceutical manufacturers or third-party rebate administrators in the future, or are unable to negotiate interim arrangements; rebates decline due to the failure of our health plan sponsors to meet market share or other thresholds; legal restrictions are imposed on the ability of pharmaceutical manufacturers to offer rebates or purchase our services relating to the administration of rebates; pharmaceutical manufacturers choose not to offer rebates or purchase our services; or rebates decline due to contracted branded products losing their patents.\nDependence on Government Spending-The Company can be adversely affected by changes in federal, state and local healthcare policies, programs, funding and enrollments.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s net revenues are derived, directly or indirectly, from governmental agencies, including state Medicaid programs. Contract rates vary from state to state, are subject to periodic negotiation and may limit the Company\u2019s ability to maintain or increase rates. The Company is unable to predict the impact on the Company\u2019s operations of future regulations or legislation affecting Medicaid programs, or the healthcare industry in general. Future regulations or legislation may have a material adverse effect on the Company. Moreover, any reduction in government spending for such programs could also have a material adverse effect on the Company (See \u201cReliance on Customer Contracts\u201d). In addition, the Company\u2019s contracts with federal, state and local governmental agencies, under both direct contract and subcontract arrangements, generally are conditioned upon financial appropriations by one or more governmental agencies, especially in the case of state Medicaid programs. These contracts generally can be terminated or modified by the customer if such appropriations are not made. The Company faces increased risks in this regard as state budgets have come under increasing pressure. Finally, some of the Company\u2019s contracts with federal, state and local governmental agencies, under both direct contract and subcontract arrangements, require the Company to perform additional services if federal, state or local laws or regulations imposed after the contract is signed so require, in exchange for additional compensation, to be negotiated by the parties in good faith. Government and other third-party\npayors generally seek to impose lower contract rates and to renegotiate reduced contract rates with service providers in a trend toward cost control.\nRestrictive Covenants in the Company\u2019s Debt Instruments-Restrictions imposed by the Company\u2019s debt agreements limit the Company\u2019s operating and financial flexibility. These restrictions may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to finance the Company\u2019s future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in the Company\u2019s interest.\nOn September 22, 2017, the Company completed the public offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.400% Senior Notes due 2024 (the \u201cNotes\u201d). The Notes are governed by an indenture dated as of September 22, 2017 (the \u201cBase Indenture\u201d), between the Company, as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, and are supplemented by a first supplemental indenture dated as of September 22, 2017 (the \u201cFirst Supplemental Indenture\u201d together, with the Base Indenture, the \u201cIndenture\u201d), between the Company, as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, the Company purchased and subsequently retired $11.1 million and $28.9 million of its Notes, respectively, which resulted in a loss on retirement of $0.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively, that is included in interest expense. The Notes were issued at a discount and had a carrying value of $388.4 million and $359.6 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively.\nThe Indenture contains certain covenants which restrict the Company\u2019s ability to, among other things, create liens on its and its subsidiaries\u2019 assets; engage in sale and lease-back transactions; and engage in a consolidation, merger or sale of assets.\nOn September 22, 2017, the Company entered into a credit agreement with various lenders that provides for a $400.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility and a $350.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility to the Company, as the borrower (the \u201c2017 Credit Agreement\u201d). On August 13, 2018, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2017 Credit Agreement, which extended the maturity date by one year. On February 27, 2019, the Company entered into a second amendment to the 2017 Credit Agreement, which amended the total leverage ratio covenant and which was necessary in order for the Company to remain in compliance with the terms of the 2017 Credit Agreement. The 2017 Credit Agreement is scheduled to mature on September 22, 2023.\nThe 2017 Credit Agreement contains covenants that limit management\u2019s discretion in operating the Company\u2019s business by restricting or limiting the Company\u2019s ability, among other things, to: incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred or redeemable stock; pay dividends and make other distributions; repurchase equity interests; make certain advances, investments and loans; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; create liens; sell and otherwise dispose of assets; acquire or merge or consolidate with another company; and enter into some types of transactions with affiliates.\nThese restrictions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in the Company\u2019s interest. The 2017 Credit Agreement also requires the Company to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Failure to do so, unless waived by the lenders under the 2017 Credit Agreement, pursuant to its terms, or amended, would result in an event of default.\nRequired Assurances of Financial Resources-The Company\u2019s liquidity, financial condition, prospects and profitability can be adversely affected by present or future state regulations and contractual requirements that the Company provide financial assurance of the Company\u2019s ability to meet the Company\u2019s obligations.\nSome of the Company\u2019s contracts and certain state regulations require the Company or certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries to maintain specified cash reserves or letters of credit and/or to maintain certain minimum tangible net equity in certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries as assurance that the Company has financial resources to meet the Company\u2019s contractual obligations. Many of these state regulations also restrict the investment activity of certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries. Some state regulations also restrict the ability of certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries to pay dividends to Magellan. Additional state regulations could be promulgated that would increase the cash or other security the Company would be required to maintain. In addition, the Company\u2019s customers may require additional restricted cash or other security with respect to the Company\u2019s obligations under the Company\u2019s contracts, including the Company\u2019s obligation to pay IBNR claims and other medical claims not yet processed and paid. In addition, certain of the Company\u2019s contracts and state regulations limit the profits that the Company may earn on risk-based business. The Company\u2019s liquidity, financial condition, prospects and profitability could be adversely affected\nby the effects of such regulations and contractual provisions. See Note 2-\u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies-Restricted Assets\u201d to the consolidated financial statements set forth elsewhere herein for a discussion of the Company\u2019s restricted assets.\nRisks Related to Realization of Goodwill and Intangible Assets-The Company\u2019s profitability could be adversely affected if the value of intangible assets is not fully realized.\nThe Company\u2019s total assets at December 31, 2020 reflect goodwill of approximately $0.9 billion, representing approximately 26.0 percent of total assets. The Company completed its annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of October 1, 2020, noting that no impairment was identified.\nAt December 31, 2020, identifiable intangible assets (customer lists, contracts, provider networks and trade names) totaled approximately $79.7 million. Intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from approximately one to eighteen years. The amortization periods used may differ from those used by other entities. In addition, the Company may be required to shorten the amortization period for intangible assets in future periods based on changes in the Company\u2019s business. There can be no assurance that such goodwill or intangible assets will be realizable.\nThe Company evaluates, on a regular basis, whether for any reason the carrying value of the Company\u2019s intangible assets and other long-lived assets may no longer be completely recoverable, in which case a charge to earnings for impairment losses could become necessary. When events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets other than goodwill by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the future cash flows expected from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.\nWhile no units were determined to be impaired at this time, reporting unit goodwill is at risk of future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in the Company\u2019s forecasted future results and cash flows. In addition, market factors utilized in the impairment analysis, including long-term growth rates or discount rates, could negatively impact the fair value of our reporting units. For testing purposes, management's best estimates of the expected future results are the primary driver in determining the fair value. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future.\nExamples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units may include such items as: (i) a decrease in expected future cash flows, specifically, a decrease in membership or rates or customer attrition and increase in costs that could significantly impact our immediate and long-range results, unfavorable working capital changes and an inability to successfully achieve our cost savings targets, (ii) adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions or an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing and/or degree (such as a recession); and (iii) volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors which could result in a higher weighted average cost of capital.\nBased on known facts and circumstances, we evaluate and consider recent events and uncertain items, as well as related potential implications, as part of our annual assessment and incorporate into the analyses as appropriate. These facts and circumstances are subject to change and may impact future analyses.\nWhile historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets in excess of carrying values, if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future.\nAny event or change in circumstances leading to a future determination requiring write-off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets or goodwill would adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company faces risks related to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member and other protected personal or health information.\nAs part of its normal operations, the Company collects, processes and retains confidential member and protected personal or health information making the Company subject to various federal and state laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of confidential member and protected personal or health information, including HIPAA. The Company also maintains other confidential information related to its business and operations. Despite our security measures, the Company is subject to security breaches, acts of vandalism, acts of ransomware and other cyber-attacks, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. For example, we have experienced data security breaches resulting in disclosure of confidential or protected personal or health information. Noncompliance with any privacy or security laws and regulations (including, but not limited to, state and federal laws and international regulations, such as GDPR) or any security incident or breach, whether by the Company or by its vendors, could result in enforcement actions, material fines and penalties, reputational and financial harm to the Company, and could also subject the Company to litigation.\nIT Systems - The Company\u2019s ability to effectively maintain and upgrade its information systems is critical to its business.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are dependent on effective information systems. Our information systems require routine maintenance, enhancements and upgrades in order to meet operational needs and regulatory requirements. The maintenance, upgrade and enhancement of our information systems requires significant economic resources. If the Company encounters difficulties in its information systems, or with the transition to or from its information systems, or does not appropriately maintain, enhance and upgrade its information systems, such events could adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations materially.\nCyber-Security-The Company faces risks related to a breach or failure in our operational security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business.\nOur business requires us to securely store, process and transmit confidential, proprietary and other information in our operations, including protected personal or health information. Security incidents or breaches may arise from, among other things, computer hackers penetrating our systems or approaching our employees to obtain personal information for financial gain, attempting to cause harm to our operations, or intending to obtain competitive, confidential or protected personal or health information. It is widely reported that the healthcare industry, including providers, plans and pharmacies, are increasingly prime targets for cyber-attacks. Our data assets and systems continue to be subject to attack by viruses, worms, phishing attempts and other malicious software programs on a regular basis, and we routinely identify attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems.\nWe maintain a comprehensive system of preventive and detective controls through our security programs; however given the rapidly evolving nature and proliferation of cyber threats, our controls may not prevent or identify all such attacks in a timely manner or otherwise prevent unauthorized access to, damage to, or interruption of our systems and operations, and we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or employee or vendor malfeasance. For example, we were the target of a criminal ransomware attack on our computer network, which resulted in a temporary systems outage and the exfiltration of certain confidential company and personal information as well as protected health information of certain members.\nAny costs that we incur as a result of a data security incident or breach, including costs to update our security protocols to mitigate such an incident or breach could be significant. Any breach or failure in our operational security systems can result in loss of data or an unauthorized disclosure of or access to sensitive or confidential member or protected personal or health information and could result in significant penalties or fines, litigation, loss of customers, significant damage to our reputation and business, and other losses, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations materially.\nWe are subject to risks associated with outsourcing services and functions to third parties.\nWe contract with third party vendors and service providers who provide services to us and our subsidiaries or to whom we delegate selected functions. Some of these third parties also have direct access to our systems. Our arrangements with third party vendors and service providers may make our operations vulnerable if those third parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, including their obligations to maintain and protect the security and confidentiality of our information and data or the protected personal or health information and data relating to our members or customers. We are also at risk of a data security incident or breach involving a vendor or third party, which could result in a\nbreakdown of such third party\u2019s data protection processes or cyber-attackers gaining access to our infrastructure through the third party, or can result in loss of data or an unauthorized disclosure of or access to sensitive or confidential member or protected personal or health information.\nTo the extent that a vendor or third party suffers a security incident or breach that compromises its operations, we could incur significant costs and possible service interruption, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operations and reputation. In addition, we may have disagreements with third party vendors and service providers regarding relative responsibilities for any such failures or security incidents or breaches under applicable business associate agreements or other applicable outsourcing agreements.\nAny contractual remedies and/or indemnification obligations we may have for vendor or service provider failures or security incidents or breaches may not be adequate to fully compensate us for any losses suffered as a result of any vendor\u2019s failure to satisfy its obligations to us or under applicable law. Further, we may not be adequately indemnified against all possible losses through the terms and conditions of our contracts with third party vendors and service providers. Our outsourcing arrangements could be adversely impacted by changes in vendors\u2019 or service providers\u2019 operations or financial condition or other matters outside of our control.\nIf we fail to adequately monitor and regulate the performance of our third-party vendors and service providers, we could be subject to additional risk, including significant cybersecurity risk. Violations of, or noncompliance with, laws and/or regulations governing our business (including, but not limited to, state and federal laws and international regulations, such as GDPR) or noncompliance with contract terms by third-party vendors and service providers could increase our exposure to liability to our members, providers, or other third parties, or sanctions and/or fines from the regulators that oversee our business, as well as litigation. In turn, this could increase the costs associated with the operation of our business or have an adverse impact on our business and reputation. Moreover, if these vendor and service provider relationships were terminated for any reason, we may not be able to find alternative partners in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms, and may incur significant costs and/or disruption to our operations in connection with any such vendor or service provider transition. As a result, we may not be able to meet the full demands of our members or customers and, in turn, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be harmed materially. In addition, we may not fully realize the anticipated economic and other benefits from our outsourcing projects or other relationships we enter into with third party vendors and service providers, as a result of regulatory restrictions on outsourcing, unanticipated delays in transitioning our operations to the third party, vendor or service provider noncompliance with contract terms or violations of laws and/or regulations, or otherwise. This could result in substantial costs or other operational or financial problems that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nRISK RELATED TO REGULATORY AND LEGAL MATTERS\nPossible Impact of Federal Mental Health Parity-could impact the Company\u2019s revenues or profitability.\nIn October 2008, the United States Congress passed the Paul Wellstone and Pete Dominici Mental Health Parity Act of 2008 (\u201cMHPAEA\u201d) establishing parity in financial requirements (e.g. co-pays, deductibles, etc.) and treatment limitations (e.g., limits on the number of visits) between mental health and substance abuse benefits and medical/surgical benefits for health plan members. The law applies to ERISA plans, Medicaid managed care plans and SCHIP plans. In 2010 regulations were issued that apply to ERISA plans and insured business. These regulations included some significant concepts not included under the statute including the requirement to conduct the parity review at the category level within the plan, introducing the concept of non-quantitative treatment limitations, and prohibiting separate but equal deductibles. In 2016 regulations were released imposing similar requirements and concepts on Medicaid Managed Care. The Company believes it is in compliance with the requirements of these regulations, however additional guidance or new parity laws could impact the business. The Company\u2019s risk contracts do allow for repricing to occur effective the same date that any legislation/regulation becomes effective if that legislation/regulation is projected to have a material effect on cost of care.\nGovernment Regulation-The Company is subject to substantial government regulation and scrutiny, which increase the Company\u2019s costs of doing business and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe managed healthcare industry is subject to extensive and evolving federal and state regulation. Such laws and regulations cover, but are not limited to, matters such as licensure, accreditation, government healthcare program\nparticipation requirements, information privacy and security, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. The Company\u2019s pharmaceutical management business is also the subject of substantial federal and state governmental regulation and scrutiny.\nRegulatory issues may also affect the Company\u2019s operations including, but not limited to: additional state licenses that may be required to conduct the Company\u2019s businesses, including utilization review, PBM, pharmacy, HMO and TPA activities; limits imposed by state authorities upon corporations\u2019 control or excessive influence over managed healthcare services through the direct employment of physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists or other professionals, and prohibiting fee splitting; laws that impose financial terms and requirements on the Company due to the Company\u2019s assumption of risk under contracts with licensed insurance companies or HMOs; laws in certain states that impose an obligation to contract with any healthcare provider willing to meet the terms of the Company\u2019s contracts with similar providers; compliance with HIPAA (including the federal HITECH Act, which strengthens and expands HIPAA) and other federal and state laws impacting the confidentiality of member information; state and federal laws governing telemedicine; state legislation regulating PBMs or imposing fiduciary status on PBMs; pharmacy laws and regulation; legislation imposing benefit plan design restrictions, which limit how our clients can design their drug benefit plans; and network pharmacy access laws, including \u201cany willing provider\u201d and \u201cdue process\u201d legislation, that affect aspects of our pharmacy network contracts.\nThe imposition of additional licensing and other regulatory requirements may, among other things, increase the Company\u2019s equity requirements, increase the cost of doing business or force significant changes in the Company\u2019s operations to comply with these requirements. In this regard, in a December 2020 decision, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Rutledge v. Pharmaceutical Care Management Association that ERISA does not pre-empt state rate or cost regulations that do not force plans to adopt particular benefit coverage. The Rutledge decision does not address other issues apart from rate regulations, however and so the Company could be subject to overlapping federal and state regulatory requirements with respect to certain of its operations and may need to implement compliance programs that satisfy multiple regulatory regimes.\nThe costs associated with compliance with government regulation as discussed above may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operation.\nProposed changes to current Federal law and regulations could have a material and adverse impact on our PBM business.\nThere are various proposed federal laws that could change some aspects of our pharmacy benefit management business. For example, the laws, if enacted, could require the pass-through of all rebate amounts to customer, or prohibit the use of \u201ctraditional\u201d pricing, under which a pharmacy benefit manager pays a pharmacy one price under its pharmacy contract, and charges a different price to the customer based on the terms of the customer contract. These and other changes, if enacted into law, may change the manner in which industry participants contract with customers, and we cannot predict with any certainty whether such alternative contract structures would be materially less profitable than current contracts.\nNoncompliance with Regulations-Noncompliance with regulations may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations, including from monetary or criminal liabilities and penalties, investigations or regulatory actions, additional compliance requirements, heightened governmental scrutiny, or exclusion from participating in government programs.\nExtensive laws and regulation are applicable to all of our business operations. In addition to laws and regulations generally applicable to our business, the Company is subject to other federal laws and regulations in connection with its contracts with the federal government. These laws and regulations affect how the Company conducts business with its federal agency customers and may impose added costs on its business. Noncompliance by the Company with these laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernment investigations and allegations have become more frequent concerning possible violations of statutes and regulations by healthcare organizations. The Company also conducts its own investigations into these matters and may choose to self-report its findings to governmental agencies. Violations by the Company with certain laws and regulations may result in it being excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subject to\nfines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed services. The Company\u2019s failure to comply with federal procurement laws and regulations could cause it to lose business, incur additional costs and subject it to a variety of civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, harm to reputation, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies. In addition, alleged violations may result in litigation or regulatory action. A subsequent legal liability or a significant regulatory action against the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, even if the Company ultimately prevails in any litigation, regulatory action or investigation, such litigation, regulatory action or investigation could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company also receives notifications from and engages in discussions with various government agencies concerning the Company\u2019s businesses and operations. As a result of these contacts with regulators, the Company may, as appropriate, be required to implement changes to the Company\u2019s operations, revise the Company\u2019s filings with such agencies and/or seek additional licenses to conduct the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s inability to comply with the various regulatory requirements may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nReference is made to information set forth under \u201cRegulation-Other Federal and State Laws and Regulations\u201d under Item 1 of this Report.\nMedicare Part D-The Company\u2019s participation in Medicare Part D is subject to government regulation and failure to comply with regulatory requirements could adversely impact the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThere are many uncertainties about the financial and regulatory risks of participating in the Medicare Part D program, and we can give no assurance these risks will not materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s results. Certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries have been approved by CMS to offer Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to employer groups. Such subsidiaries are required to comply with Medicare Part D laws and regulations and, because CMS requires that Medicare Part D sponsors be licensed as risk-bearing entities, also with applicable state laws and regulations regarding the business of insurance. The Company also provides services in support of our clients\u2019 Medicare Part D plans and must be able to deliver such services in a manner that complies with applicable regulatory requirements. The adoption of new or more complex regulatory requirements or changes in the interpretation of existing regulatory requirements associated with Medicare Part D may require us to incur significant costs or otherwise impact our ability to earn a profit on such business. In addition, the Company\u2019s receipt of federal funds made available through the Medicare Part D program is subject to compliance with the laws and regulations governing the federal government\u2019s payment for healthcare goods and services, including the Federal Anti-Kickback law and False Claims Acts. If we fail to comply materially with applicable regulatory or contractual requirements, whether identified through CMS or other government audits, client audits, or otherwise, we may be subject to certain sanctions, penalties, or other remedies, including, but not limited to, suspension of marketing or enrollment activities, restrictions on expanding our service area, civil monetary penalties or other monetary amounts, termination of our contract(s) with CMS or Part D clients, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs.\nThe Company faces additional regulatory risks associated with its Pharmacy Management segment which could subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny and liability and which could adversely affect the profitability of the Pharmacy Management segment in the future.\nVarious aspects of the Company\u2019s Pharmacy Management segment are governed by federal and state laws and regulations. Pharmaceutical management services are provided by the Company to Medicaid and Medicare plans as well as commercial insurance plans. There has been enhanced scrutiny on federal programs and the Company must remain vigilant in ensuring compliance with the requirements of these programs. Significant sanctions may be imposed for violations of these laws and compliance programs are a significant operational requirement of the Company\u2019s business. There are significant uncertainties involving the application of many of these legal requirements to the Company. Accordingly, the Company may be required to incur additional administrative and compliance expenses in determining the applicable requirements and in adapting its compliance practices, or modifying its business practices, in order to satisfy changing interpretations and regulatory policies. In addition, there are numerous proposed healthcare laws and regulations at the federal and state levels, many of which, if adopted, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. See \u201cRegulation\u201d above.\nClaims for Professional Liability-Pending or future actions or claims for professional liability (including any associated judgments, settlements, legal fees and other costs) could require the Company to make significant cash expenditures and consume significant management time and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s operating activities entail significant risks of liability. In recent years, participants in the healthcare industry generally, as well as the managed healthcare industry, have become subject to an increasing number of lawsuits. From time to time, the Company is subject to various actions and claims of professional liability alleging negligence in performing utilization review and other managed healthcare activities, as well as for the acts or omissions of the Company\u2019s employees, including employed physicians and other clinicians, network providers, pharmacists, or others. In the normal course of business, the Company receives reports relating to deaths and other serious incidents involving patients whose care is being managed by the Company. Such incidents occasionally give rise to malpractice, professional negligence and other related actions and claims against the Company, the Company\u2019s employees or the Company\u2019s network providers. The Company is also subject to actions and claims for the costs of services for which payment was denied. Many of these actions and claims seek substantial damages and require the Company to incur significant fees and costs related to the Company\u2019s defense and consume significant management time and resources. While the Company maintains professional liability insurance, there can be no assurance that future actions or claims for professional liability (including any judgments, settlements or costs associated therewith) will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability and financial condition.\nProfessional Liability and Other Insurance-Claims brought against the Company that exceed the scope of the Company\u2019s liability coverage or denial of coverage could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability and financial condition.\nThe Company maintains a program of insurance coverage against a broad range of risks in the Company\u2019s business. As part of this program of insurance, the Company carries professional liability insurance, subject to certain deductibles and self-insured retentions. The Company also is sometimes required by customer contracts to post surety bonds with respect to the Company\u2019s potential liability on professional responsibility claims that may be asserted in connection with services the Company provides. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $154.1 million of such bonds outstanding. The Company\u2019s insurance may not be sufficient to cover any judgments, settlements or costs relating to present or future claims, suits or complaints. Upon expiration of the Company\u2019s insurance policies, sufficient insurance may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. To the extent the Company\u2019s customers are entitled to indemnification under their contracts with the Company relating to liabilities they incur arising from the operation of the Company\u2019s programs, such indemnification may not be covered under the Company\u2019s insurance policies. To the extent that certain actions and claims seek punitive and compensatory damages arising from the Company\u2019s alleged intentional misconduct, such damages, if awarded, may not be covered, in whole or in part, by the Company\u2019s insurance policies. If the Company is unable to secure adequate insurance in the future, or if the insurance the Company carries is not sufficient to cover any judgments, settlements or costs relating to any present or future actions or claims, such judgments, settlements or costs may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability and financial condition. If the Company is unable to obtain needed surety bonds in adequate amounts or make alternative arrangements to satisfy the requirements for such bonds, the Company may no longer be able to operate in those states, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nClass Action Suits and Other Legal Proceedings-The Company is subject to class action and other lawsuits that could result in material liabilities to the Company or cause the Company to incur material costs, to change the Company\u2019s operating procedures in ways that increase costs or to comply with additional regulatory requirements.\nManaged healthcare companies and PBM companies have been targeted as defendants in national class action lawsuits regarding their business practices. The Company is subject to such national class actions as defendants and is also subject to or a party to other class actions, lawsuits and legal proceedings in conducting the Company\u2019s business, including but not limited to, network provider reimbursement, employment practices, and privacy and data protection. In addition, certain of the Company\u2019s customers are parties to pending class action lawsuits regarding the customers\u2019 business practices for which the customers could seek indemnification from the Company. These lawsuits may take years to resolve and cause the Company to incur substantial litigation expense, and the outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability and financial condition. In addition to potential damage awards, depending upon the outcomes of such cases, these lawsuits may cause or force changes in practices of the Company\u2019s industry and\nmay also cause additional regulation of the industry through new federal or state laws or new applications of existing laws or regulations. Such changes could increase the Company\u2019s operating costs.\nOur amended bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for: (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (2) any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; (3) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, our certificate of incorporation, or our bylaws; and (4) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to actions brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all Securities Act claims, which means both courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our bylaws provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring an action in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring an action in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of our exclusive forum provisions, which may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions. If a court were to find either exclusive forum provision in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could seriously harm our business.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nNegative Publicity-The Company may be subject to negative publicity which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nFrom time to time, the managed healthcare industry has received negative publicity. This publicity has led to increased legislation, regulation, review of industry practices and private litigation. These factors may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to market our services, require the Company to change its services, or increase the overall regulatory burden under which the Company operates. Any of these factors may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nInvestment Portfolio-The value of the Company\u2019s investments is influenced by varying economic and market conditions, and a decrease in value may result in a loss charged to income.\nAll of the Company\u2019s investments are classified as \u201cavailable-for-sale\u201d and are carried at fair value. The Company\u2019s available-for-sale investment securities were $143.5 million and represented 4.3 percent of the Company\u2019s total assets at December 31, 2020.\nThe current economic environment and recent volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets. The Company believes it has adequately reviewed its investment securities for impairment and that its investment securities are carried at fair value. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change the Company\u2019s judgment regarding impairment. This could result in realized losses relating to other-than-temporary declines being charged against future income. Given the\ncurrent market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is a risk that declines in fair value may occur and material other-than-temporary impairments may be charged to income in future periods, resulting in realized losses. In addition, if it became necessary for the Company to liquidate its investment portfolio on an accelerated basis, it could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nAdverse Economic Conditions-Adverse changes in national economic conditions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nChanges in national economic conditions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reimbursement from state Medicaid programs in its Healthcare segment. Adverse economic conditions could also adversely affect the Company\u2019s customers in the Healthcare and Pharmacy Management segments resulting in increased pressures on the Company\u2019s operating margins. In addition, economic conditions may result in decreased membership in the Healthcare and Pharmacy Management segments, thereby adversely affecting the revenues to the Company from such customers as well as the Company\u2019s operating profitability.\nAdverse economic conditions in the debt markets could affect the Company\u2019s ability to refinance the Company\u2019s existing Credit Agreement upon its maturity on acceptable terms, or at all.\nTalent Management - The Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain employees and manage the succession and retention of key executives is critical to our success.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the Company\u2019s success. There is competition among potential employers for qualified and experienced employees and there is no assurance that the Company will be able to attract or retain such employees. In addition, competition among potential employers could result in increased salaries and benefits. If the Company is unable to retain its employees, or attract additional employees, such events could result in a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe Company also could be impacted adversely if the Company is unable to plan adequately for the succession of executives and senior management. The Company has succession plans in place, however, such plans do not guarantee that the services of these employees will continue to be available to us.\nTax matters, including the changes in corporate tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S., and our operations, plans and results of operations are affected by tax and other initiatives. As a result of the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), corporate tax rates in the United States decreased in 2018, which resulted in changes to our valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. These changes in valuation were material to our income tax expense and deferred tax balances.\nWe are also subject to regular reviews, examinations, and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities with respect to our taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. There can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nOur effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the application or interpretation of the Tax Act, or other changes in tax laws.\nExtraordinary Events-Extraordinary events, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations could be subject to an epidemic or health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, political disruptions, acts of war or terrorism and other such extraordinary events. These events could cause significant disruptions in the Company\u2019s operations and its ability to serve its members. If a business interruption occurs and we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to minimize the impact of these events, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Such events could also impact the\nCompany\u2019s utilization, which could have a favorable or unfavorable impact to its medical loss ratios. In addition, such events could impact the financial markets, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and its ability to access the credit markets.\nIn 2020, the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant financial market volatility and economic uncertainty, and is currently impacting countries, communities and workforces around the world. To date, the Company has not experienced any negative impact on its medical loss ratios and, other than the transition of our employees to a work at home environment, the Company has not experienced any significant interruptions to normal business activities and has not experienced any disruptions in its services. In addition, the Company does not expect the valuation of its investments to be materially affected. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition are dependent on future developments for which there is significant uncertainty at this time and cannot be predicted, such as the scope, duration and severity of the pandemic, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, any actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak, the possible impact on the global economy and local economies in which we operate and the resumption of normal economic conditions. The long-term financial and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may continue for a significant period of time and cannot be reliably quantified or estimated at this time due to the uncertainty of future developments.", "PERMNO": 90011, "SIC": 8741, "TIC": "MGLN"}
