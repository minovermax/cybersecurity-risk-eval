{"cik": "56679", "company": "KORN FERRY INTERNATIONAL", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-06-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below are the material risks facing our Company. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.\nCompetition in our industries could result in our losing market share and/or require us to charge lower prices for services, which could reduce our revenue.\nWe compete for executive recruitment business with numerous executive recruitment firms and businesses that provide job placement services, including other large global executive search firms, smaller specialty firms and web-based firms. Traditional executive recruitment competitors include Egon Zehnder International, Heidrick & Struggles International, Inc., Russell Reynolds Associates and Spencer Stuart. In each of our markets, one or more of our competitors may possess greater resources, greater name recognition, lower overhead or other costs and longer operating histories than we do, which may give them an advantage in obtaining future clients, capitalizing on new technology and attracting qualified professionals in these markets. Additionally, specialty firms can focus on regional or functional markets or on particular industries and executive search firms that have a smaller client base may be subject to fewer off-limits arrangements. There are no extensive barriers to entry into the executive recruitment industry and new recruiting firms continue to enter the market. We believe the continuing development and increased availability of information technology will continue to attract new competitors, especially web-enabled professional and social networking website providers and these providers may be facilitating a company\u2019s ability to insource their recruiting capabilities. As these providers continue to evolve, they may develop offerings similar to or more expansive than ours, thereby increasing competition for our services or more broadly causing disruption in the executive recruitment industry. The human resource consulting business has been traditionally fragmented and a number of large consulting firms, such as Accenture, Aon Hewitt and Towers Watson are building businesses in human resource management consulting to serve these needs. Increased competition, whether as a result of these professional and social networking website providers or traditional executive recruitment firms, may lead to pricing pressures that could negatively impact our business. For example, increased competition could require us to charge lower prices, and/or cause us to lose market share, each of which could reduce our fee revenue.\nIf we fail to attract and retain qualified and experienced consultants, our revenue could decline and our business could be harmed.\nWe compete with other executive recruitment and consulting firms for qualified and experienced consultants. These other firms may be able to offer greater compensation and benefits or more attractive lifestyle choices, career paths or geographic locations than we do. Attracting and retaining consultants in our industry is particularly important because, generally, a small number of consultants have primary responsibility for a client relationship. Because client responsibility is so concentrated, the loss of key consultants may lead to the loss of client relationships. In 2015, for example, our top three executive search consultants had primary responsibility for generating business equal to approximately 1% of our net revenues, and our top ten executive search consultants had primary responsibility for generating business equal to approximately 4% of our net revenues. This risk is heightened due to the general portability of a consultant\u2019s business; consultants have in the past, and will in the future, terminate their employment with our Company. Any decrease in the quality of our reputation, reduction in our compensation levels relative to our peers or restructuring of our compensation program, whether as a result of insufficient revenue, a decline in the market price of our common stock or for any other reason, could impair our ability to retain existing consultants or attract additional qualified consultants with the requisite experience, skills and established client relationships. Our failure to retain our most productive consultants, whether in Executive Recruitment, LTC or Futurestep, or maintain the quality of service to which our clients are accustomed and the ability of a departing consultant to move business to his or her new employer could result in a loss of clients, which could in turn cause our fee revenue to decline and our business to be harmed. We may also lose clients if the departing executive search, LTC or Futurestep consultant has widespread name recognition or a reputation as a specialist in his or her line of business in a specific industry or management function. We could also lose additional consultants if they choose to join the departing executive search consultant at another executive search or consulting firm. If we fail to limit departing consultants from moving business or recruiting our consultants to a competitor, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAcquisitions, or our inability to effect acquisitions, may have an adverse effect on our business.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have completed strategic acquisitions of businesses in the last several years, including our acquisitions of Pivot Leadership in fiscal 2015 and PDI and Global Novations in fiscal 2013. While we may pursue additional acquisitions in the future, our ability to consummate such acquisitions on satisfactory terms will depend on:\n\u2022\nthe extent to which acquisition opportunities become available;\n\u2022\nour success in bidding for the opportunities that do become available;\n\u2022\nnegotiating terms that we believe are reasonable; and\n\u2022\nregulatory approval, if required.\nOur ability to make strategic acquisitions may also be conditioned on our ability to fund such acquisitions through the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. Our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement, as amended as of June 3, 2015, limits us from consummating permitted acquisitions, paying dividends to our stockholders and making share repurchases in any fiscal year to a cumulative total of $125.0 million. The senior unsecured revolving credit agreement also limits the amount of consideration paid with respect to acquisitions to $100.0 million in any fiscal year, which amount is further limited by any shares repurchased and dividends paid to stockholders, as discussed above. If we are required to incur substantial indebtedness in connection with an acquisition, and the results of the acquisition are not favorable, the increased indebtedness could decrease the value of our equity. In addition, if we need to issue additional equity to consummate an acquisition, doing so would cause dilution to existing stockholders.\nIf we are unable to make strategic acquisitions, or the acquisitions we do make are not on terms favorable to us or not effected in a timely manner, it may impede the growth of our business, which could adversely impact our profitability and our stock price.\nOur ability to integrate future acquisitions, if any, could negatively affect our business and profitability.\nOur future success may depend in part on our ability to complete the integration of acquisition targets successfully into our operations. The process of integrating an acquired business may subject us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management attention;\n\u2022\namortization of intangible assets, adversely affecting our reported results of operations;\n\u2022\ninability to retain and/or integrate the management, key personnel and other employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ninability to properly integrate businesses resulting in operating inefficiencies;\n\u2022\ninability to establish uniform standards, disclosure controls and procedures, internal control over financial reporting and other systems, procedures and policies in a timely manner;\n\u2022\ninability to retain the acquired company\u2019s clients;\n\u2022\nexposure to legal claims for activities of the acquired business prior to acquisition; and\n\u2022\nincurrence of additional expenses in connection with the integration process.\nIf our acquisitions are not successfully integrated, our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our professional reputation, could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are a cyclical Company whose performance is tied to local and global economic conditions.\nDemand for our services is affected by global economic conditions and the general level of economic activity in the geographic regions and industries in which we operate. When conditions in the global economy, including the credit markets, deteriorate, or economic activity slows, many companies hire fewer permanent employees and some companies, as a cost-saving measure, choose to rely on their own human resources departments rather than third-party search firms to find talent, which negatively affects our financial condition and results of operations, as evidenced by our results of operations during the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009 that continued to impact our results of operations through fiscal 2010. We may also experience more competitive pricing pressure during periods of economic decline. While the economic activity in the regions and industries in which we operate has shown improvement, general market uncertainty continues to exist. If such uncertainty persists, if the national or global economy or credit market conditions in general deteriorate, or if the unemployment rate increases, such uncertainty or changes could put negative pressure on demand for our services and our pricing, resulting in lower cash flows and a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, some of our clients may experience reduced access to credit and lower revenues resulting in their inability to meet their payment obligations to us.\nIf we are unable to retain our executive officers and key personnel, or integrate new members of our senior management who are critical to our business, we may not be able to successfully manage our business in the future.\nOur future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we may compete with other companies that have greater financial and other resources than we do. If we lose the services of one or more of our executives or key employees, or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us, or if we are unable to integrate new members of our senior management who are critical to our business, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives.\nIf we are unable to maintain our professional reputation and brand name, our business will be harmed.\nWe depend on our overall reputation and brand name recognition to secure new engagements and to hire qualified professionals. Our success also depends on the individual reputations of our professionals. We obtain a majority of our new engagements from existing clients or from referrals by those clients. Any client who is dissatisfied with our services can adversely affect our ability to secure new engagements.\nIf any factor, including poor performance or negative publicity, whether or not true, hurts our reputation, we may experience difficulties in competing successfully for both new engagements and qualified consultants. Failing to maintain our professional reputation and the goodwill associated with our brand name could seriously harm our business.\nThe expansion of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges that can cause damage to our brand and reputation.\nThe inappropriate and/or unauthorized use of certain media vehicles could cause damage to our brand or information leakage that could lead to legal implications, including improper collection and/or dissemination of personally identifiable information of candidates and clients. In addition, negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website could damage our reputation, brand image and goodwill.\nWe are subject to potential legal liability from clients, employees and candidates for employment. Insurance coverage may not be available to cover all of our potential liability and available coverage may not be sufficient to cover all claims that we may incur.\nOur ability to obtain liability insurance, its coverage levels, deductibles and premiums are all dependent on market factors, our loss history and insurers\u2019 perception of our overall risk profile. We are exposed to potential claims with respect to the executive recruitment process. For example, a client could assert a claim for matters such as breach of an off-limit agreement or recommending a candidate who subsequently proves to be unsuitable for the position filled. Further, the current employer of a candidate whom we placed could file a claim against us alleging interference with an employment contract, a candidate could assert an action against us for failure to maintain the confidentiality of the candidate\u2019s employment search, and a candidate or employee could assert an action against us for alleged discrimination, violations of labor and employment law or other matters. Also, in various countries, we are subject to data protection laws impacting the processing of candidate information and other regulatory requirements.\nAdditionally, as part of our LTC services, we often send a team of leadership consultants to our client\u2019s workplaces. Such consultants generally have access to client information systems and confidential information. An inherent risk of such activity includes possible claims of misuse or misappropriation of client intellectual property, confidential information, funds, or other property; harassment; criminal activity; torts; or other claims. Such claims may result in negative publicity, injunctive relief, criminal investigations and/or charges, payment by us of monetary damages or fines, or other material adverse effects on our business.\nWe cannot ensure that our insurance will cover all claims or that insurance coverage will be available at economically acceptable rates. Our insurance may also require us to meet a deductible. Significant uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely heavily on our information systems and if we lose that technology, or fail to further develop our technology, our business could be harmed.\nOur success depends in large part upon our ability to store, retrieve, process, manage and protect substantial amounts of information. To achieve our strategic objectives and to remain competitive, we must continue to develop and enhance our information systems. This may require the acquisition of equipment and software and the development of new proprietary software, either internally or through independent consultants. If we are\nunable to design, develop, implement and utilize, in a cost-effective manner, information systems that provide the capabilities necessary for us to compete effectively, or for any reason any interruption or loss of our information processing capabilities occurs, this could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we have disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against the effects of a disaster on our information technology, we cannot be sure that insurance or these services will continue to be available at reasonable prices, cover all our losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients occurring during any period that we are unable to provide business services.\nCyber security vulnerabilities could lead to improper disclosure of information obtained from our clients, candidates and employees that could result in liability and harm our reputation.\nWe use information technology and other computer resources to carry out operational and marketing activities and to maintain our business records. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches against various entities and organizations provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. This environment demands that we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls across our business groups and geographies in order to protect information that we develop or that is obtained from our clients, candidates and employees. Despite these efforts, given the ongoing and increasingly sophisticated attempts to access the information of entities, our security controls over this information, our training of employees, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of such information. In fiscal 2013, we discovered that our computer network was the target of a criminal data breach that accessed certain such information obtained from our clients, candidates and employees. The information we collected about this breach suggests that the intrusion falls within the category of an \u201cAdvanced Persistent Threat\u201d, which is activity consistent with state sponsored cyber criminals. Although this data breach was limited in scope, and as such, did not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial reporting capabilities, future breaches of this nature as well as any other security breach or other misuse of our data could lead to improper disclosure of Company information, including information obtained from our clients, candidates and employees, that could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure, divert management attention and resources, increase our operating expenses due to the employment of consultants and third party experts and the purchase of additional infrastructure, and/or subject us to liability, resulting in increased costs and loss of revenue. More specifically, since fiscal 2013, we have incurred such costs to bolster our security against future attacks; such efforts and expenditures, however, cannot provide absolute assurance that future data breaches will not occur. We depend on our overall reputation and brand name recognition to secure new engagements. Perceptions that we do not adequately protect the privacy of information could inhibit attaining new engagements and qualified consultants, and could potentially damage currently existing client relationships.\nLimited protection of our intellectual property could harm our business, and we face the risk that our services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe cannot guarantee that trade secret, trademark and copyright law protections are adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property (which has become an increasingly important part of our business). Existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or products may offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights. Redressing infringements may consume significant management time and financial resources. Also, we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take the necessary steps to enforce our rights, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We cannot be sure that our services and products, or the products of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or our clients. These claims may harm our reputation, result in financial liability and prevent us from offering some services or products.\nWe have invested in specialized technology and other intellectual property for which we may fail to fully recover our investment or which may become obsolete.\nWe have invested in developing specialized technology and intellectual property, including proprietary systems, processes and methodologies, such as Searcher Express and KF Insight, that we believe provide us a competitive advantage in serving our current clients and winning new engagements. Many of our service and product offerings rely on specialized technology or intellectual property that is subject to rapid change, and to the extent that this technology and intellectual property is rendered obsolete and of no further use to us or our clients, our ability to continue offering these services, and grow our revenues, could be adversely affected. There is no assurance that we will be able to develop new, innovative or improved technology or intellectual property or that our technology and intellectual property will effectively compete with the intellectual property developed by our competitors. If we are unable to develop new technology and intellectual property or if our competitors develop better technology or intellectual property, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe face risks associated with social and political instability, legal requirements, economic conditions and currency fluctuations in our international operations.\nWe operate in 37 countries and during the year ended April 30, 2015, generated 46% of our fee revenue from operations outside of the United States. We are exposed to the risk of changes in social, political, legal and economic conditions inherent in international operations. Examples of risks inherent in transacting business worldwide that we are exposed to include:\n\u2022\nchanges in and compliance with applicable laws and regulatory requirements, including U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control, and similar foreign laws such as the U.K. Bribery Act, as well the fact that many countries have legal systems, local laws and trade practices that are unsettled and evolving, and/or commercial laws that are vague and/or inconsistently applied;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing global operations, which could impact our ability to maintain an effective system of internal control;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in building and maintaining a competitive presence in existing and new markets;\n\u2022\nsocial, economic and political instability;\n\u2022\ndifferences in cultures and business practices;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nstatutory equity requirements;\n\u2022\ndifferences in accounting and reporting requirements;\n\u2022\nrepatriation controls;\n\u2022\ndifferences in labor and market conditions;\n\u2022\npotential adverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022\nmultiple regulations concerning pay rates, benefits, vacation, statutory holiday pay, workers\u2019 compensation, union membership, termination pay, the termination of employment, and other employment laws.\nWe have no hedging or similar foreign currency contracts and therefore, as described below, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could impact our global results of operations. We cannot ensure that one or more of these factors will not harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nForeign currency exchange rate risks may adversely affect our results of operations.\nA material portion of our revenue and expenses are generated by our operations in foreign countries, and we expect that our foreign operations will account for a material portion of our revenue and expenses in the future. Most of our international expenses and revenue are denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, our financial results could be affected by factors, such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets in which we have operations. Fluctuations in the value of those currencies in relation to the United States dollar have caused and will continue to cause dollar-translated amounts to vary from one period to another. Given the volatility of exchange rates, we may not be able to manage effectively our currency translation or transaction risks, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be limited in our ability to recruit candidates from our clients and we could lose those opportunities to our competition, which could harm our business.\nEither by agreement with clients, or for client relations or marketing purposes, we sometimes refrain from, for a specified period of time, recruiting candidates from a client when conducting searches on behalf of other clients. These off-limit agreements can generally remain in effect for up to two years following completion of an assignment. The duration and scope of the off-limit agreement, including whether it covers all operations of the client and its affiliates or only certain divisions of a client, generally are subject to negotiation or internal policies and may depend on factors such as the scope, size and complexity of the client\u2019s business, the length of the client relationship and the frequency with which we have been engaged to perform executive searches for the client. If a prospective client believes that we are overly restricted by these off-limit agreements from recruiting employees of our existing clients, these prospective clients may not engage us to perform their executive searches. Therefore, our inability to recruit candidates from these clients may make it difficult for us to obtain search assignments from, or to fulfill search assignments for, other companies in that client\u2019s industry. We cannot ensure that off-limit agreements will not impede our growth or our ability to attract and serve new clients, or otherwise harm our business.\nConsolidation in the industries that we serve could harm our business.\nCompanies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies. If two or more of our clients merge or consolidate and combine their operations, we may experience a decrease in the amount of services we perform for these clients. If one of our clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services, we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work. The increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us. Any of these possible results of industry consolidation could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have provisions that make an acquisition of us more difficult and expensive.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws and under Delaware law make it more difficult and expensive for us to be acquired in a transaction that is not approved by our Board of Directors. Some of the provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include:\n\u2022\nlimitation on stockholder actions;\n\u2022\nadvance notification requirements for director nominations and actions to be taken at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nthe ability to issue one or more series of preferred stock by action of our Board of Directors.\nThese provisions could discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction in which stockholders could receive a premium over the current market price for the common stock.\nUnfavorable tax laws, tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other taxes are subject to ongoing audits by United States federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-United States authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from estimated amounts recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments.\nWe have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to use under certain circumstances.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase in our effective tax rate, and an adverse effect on our future operating results. In addition, changes in statutory tax rates may also change our deferred tax assets or liability balances, with either a favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate. Our deferred tax assets may also be impacted by new legislation or regulation.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.\nGoodwill is initially recorded as the excess of amounts paid over the fair value of net assets acquired. While goodwill is not amortized, it is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. In assessing the carrying value of goodwill, we make qualitative and quantitative assumptions and estimates about revenues, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates based on our business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management\u2019s judgment in applying these factors. Goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit and a market approach. We could be required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill prior to the annual assessment, if we experience unexpected significant declines in operating results or sustained market capitalization declines. These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. Impairment charges could substantially affect our results of operations and net worth in the periods of such charges.\nWe may not be able to align our cost structure with our revenue level which in turn may require additional financing in the future that may not be available at all or may be available only on unfavorable terms.\nWe continuously evaluate our cost base in relation to projected near to mid-term demand for our services in an effort to align our cost structure with the current realities of our markets. If actual or projected fee revenues are negatively impacted by weakening customer demand, we may find it necessary to take cost cutting measures so that we can minimize the impact on our profitability. There is, however, no guarantee that if we do take such measures that such measures will properly align our cost structure to our revenue level. Any failure to maintain a balance between our cost structure and our revenue could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and lead to negative cash flows, which in turn might require us to obtain additional financing to meet our capital needs. If we are unable to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, our ability to fund our operations could be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe invest in marketable securities classified as trading and available for sale and if the market value of these securities declines materially, they could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nMarketable securities consist of mutual funds and investments in corporate bonds, commercial paper and U.S. Treasury and agency securities. The primary objectives of the mutual funds are to meet the obligations under certain of our deferred compensation plans, while the other securities are available for general corporate purposes. If the financial markets in which these securities trade were to materially decline in value, the unrealized losses and potential realized losses could negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nOur inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.\nShould we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities, and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. In such an event, we could experience near-term operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations. In particular, our ability to recover from any disaster or other business continuity problem will depend on our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. We could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster. We will continue to regularly assess and take steps to improve upon our business continuity plans. However, a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability.\nChanges in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to revenue recognition, restructuring, deferred compensation, goodwill and other intangible assets, contingencies, annual performance related bonuses, allowance for doubtful accounts, marketable securities, share-based payments and deferred income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and changes in accounting standards could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations.\nYou may not receive the level of dividends provided for in the dividend policy our Board of Directors has adopted or any dividends at all.\nWe are not obligated to pay dividends on our common stock. Our Board of Directors adopted a dividend policy on December 8, 2014, that reflects an intention to distribute to our stockholders a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share of common stock. We paid our first dividend under this program on April 9, 2015. The declaration and payment of all future dividends to holders of our common stock are subject to the discretion\nof our Board of Directors, which may amend, revoke or suspend our dividend policy at any time and for any reason, including, earnings, capital requirements, financial conditions, and other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant. The terms of our indebtedness may also restrict us from paying cash dividends on our common stock under certain circumstances. See below \u201c- Our ability to pay dividends will be restricted by agreements governing our debt, including our credit agreement, and by Delaware law.\u201d\nOver time, our capital and other cash needs may change significantly from our current needs, which could affect whether we pay dividends and the level of any dividends we may pay in the future. If we were to use borrowings under our credit facility to fund our payment of dividends, we would have less cash and/or borrowing capacity available for future dividends and other purposes, which could negatively affect our financial condition, our results of operations, our liquidity and our ability to maintain and expand our business. Accordingly, you may not receive dividends in the intended amounts, or at all. Any reduction or elimination of dividends may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur ability to pay dividends will be restricted by agreements governing our debt, including our credit agreement, and by Delaware law.\nOur credit agreement restricts our ability to pay dividends. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Long-Term Debt\u201d where we describe the terms of our indebtedness, including provisions limiting our ability to declare and pay dividends. As a result of such restrictions, we may be limited in our ability to pay dividends unless we amend our credit agreement or otherwise obtain a waiver from our lenders. In addition, as a result of general economic conditions, conditions in the lending markets, the results of our business or for any other reason, we may elect or be required to amend or refinance our senior credit facility, at or prior to maturity, or enter into additional agreements for indebtedness. Any such amendment, refinancing or additional agreement may contain covenants which could limit in a significant manner or entirely our ability to pay dividends to you.\nAdditionally, under the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), our Board of Directors may not authorize payment of a dividend unless it is either paid out of surplus, as calculated in accordance with the DGCL, or if we do not have a surplus, it is paid out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year.\nIf, as a result of these restrictions, we are required to reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends, a decline in the market price or liquidity, or both, of our common stock could result. This may in turn result in losses by you.\nOur dividend policy may limit our ability to pursue growth opportunities.\nIf we pay dividends at the level currently anticipated under our dividend policy, we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to finance growth opportunities, meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements or fund our operations in the event of a significant business downturn. In addition, because a portion of cash available will be distributed to holders of our common stock under our dividend policy, our ability to pursue any material expansion of our business, including through acquisitions, increased capital spending or other increases of our expenditures, will depend more than it otherwise would on our ability to obtain third party financing. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available to us at all, or at an acceptable cost. If we are unable to take timely advantage of growth opportunities, our future financial condition and competitive position may be harmed, which in turn may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs we develop new services, clients and practices, enter new lines of business, and focus more of our business on providing a full range of client solutions, our operating risks increase.\nAs part of our corporate strategy, we are attempting to leverage our research and advisory services to sell a full range of services across the life cycle of a policy, program, project, or initiative, and we are regularly\nsearching for ways to provide new services to clients. In addition, we plan to extend our services to new clients, into new lines of business, and into new geographic locations. As we focus on developing new services, clients, practice areas and lines of business; open new offices; and do business in new geographic locations, those efforts could be unsuccessful and adversely affect our results of operations.\nSuch growth efforts place substantial additional demands on our management and staff, as well as on our information, financial, administrative and operational systems. We may not be able to manage these demands successfully. Growth may require increased recruiting efforts, opening new offices, increased business development, selling, marketing and other actions that are expensive and entail increased risk. We may need to invest more in our people and systems, controls, compliance efforts, policies and procedures than we anticipate. Therefore, even if we do grow, the demands on our people and systems, controls, compliance efforts, policies and procedures may be sufficiently great that the quality of our work, our operating margins, and our operating results suffer, at least in the short-term, and perhaps in the long-term.\nEfforts involving a different focus, new services, new clients, new practice areas, new lines of business, new offices and new geographic locations entail inherent risks associated with our inexperience and competition from mature participants in those areas. Our inexperience may result in costly decisions that could harm our profit and operating results. In particular, new or improved services often relate to the development, implementation and improvement of critical infrastructure or operating systems that our clients may view as \u201cmission critical,\u201d and if we fail to satisfy the needs of our clients in providing these services, our clients could incur significant costs and losses for which they could seek compensation from us. Finally, as our business continues to evolve and we provide a wider range of services, we will become increasingly dependent upon our employees, particularly those operating in business environments less familiar to us.
