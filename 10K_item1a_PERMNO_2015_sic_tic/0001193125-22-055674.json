These risks could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. These risks are not exclusive, and additional risks to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the factors mentioned under \u201cCautionary note regarding forward-looking statements\u201d and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021.\nRisk Factor Summary\nThe following summarizes material risks to the Company and is qualified by the full description contained below herewith. The occurrence of any of the following risks or of unknown risks and uncertainties may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nStrategic Risks\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to successfully execute our strategic plans to strengthen our financial position and create long-term shareholder value.\n\u2022\nCOVID-19\ncould materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Estimates, Assumptions and Valuations\n\u2022\nIf our reserves for future policy claims are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nIf the models used in our businesses are inaccurate, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nWe may be required to increase our reserves as a result of deviations from our estimates and actuarial assumptions or other reasons, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nWe may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the present value of future profits, which would increase our expenses and reduce profitability.\n\u2022\nWhen we have projected profits in earlier years followed by projected losses in later years (as is currently the case with our long-term care insurance business), we are required to increase our reserve liabilities over time to offset the projected future losses, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nOur valuation of fixed maturity and equity securities uses methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to change and differing interpretations which could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nThe extent of the benefits Enact Holdings realizes from its future loss mitigation actions or programs may be limited.\nLiquidity, Financial Strength and Credit Ratings, and Counterparty and Credit Risks\n\u2022\nGenworth Financial and Genworth Holdings depend on the ability of their respective subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments and distributions to each of them and to meet their obligations.\n\u2022\nOur sources of capital have become more limited, and under certain conditions we may need to seek additional capital on unfavorable terms.\n\u2022\nAdverse rating agency actions have resulted in a loss of business and adversely affected our results of operations, financial condition and business and future adverse rating actions could have a further and more significant adverse impact on us.\n\u2022\nDefaults by counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements or to derivative instruments we use to hedge our business risks, or defaults by us on agreements we have with these counterparties, may expose us to risks we sought to mitigate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nDefaults or other events impacting the value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio may reduce our income.\nRisks Relating to Economic and Market Conditions\n\u2022\nInterest rates and changes in rates could materially adversely affect our business and profitability.\n\u2022\nA deterioration in economic conditions or a decline in home prices may adversely affect Enact Holdings\u2019 loss experience.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\n\u2022\nOur insurance businesses are extensively regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth.\n\u2022\nLitigation and regulatory investigations or other actions are common in the insurance business and may result in financial losses and harm our reputation.\n\u2022\nAn adverse change in our regulatory requirements, including risk-based capital, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nChanges to the role of the GSEs or to the charters or business practices of the GSEs, including actions or decisions to decrease or discontinue the use of mortgage insurance, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nIf Enact Holdings is unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs because the GSEs amend them or the GSEs\u2019 interpretation of the financial requirements requires Enact Holdings to hold amounts of capital that are higher than planned or otherwise, Enact Holdings may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nEnact Holdings\u2019 U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum statutory capital requirements, which if not met or waived, would result in restrictions or prohibitions on them doing business and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nChanges in regulations that adversely affect the mortgage insurance markets in which Enact Holdings operates could affect its operations significantly and could reduce the demand for mortgage insurance.\n\u2022\nOur U.S. life insurance subsidiaries may not be able to continue to mitigate the impact of Regulations XXX or AXXX and, therefore, they may incur higher operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nChanges in accounting and reporting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies and insurance regulators could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperational Risks\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to retain, attract and motivate qualified employees or senior management, our results of operations, financial condition and business operations may be adversely impacted.\n\u2022\nEnact Holdings\u2019 reliance on key customers or distribution relationships could cause a loss of significant sales if one or more of those relationships terminate or are reduced.\n\u2022\nEnact Holdings competes with government-owned and government-sponsored enterprises, and this may put them at a competitive disadvantage on pricing and other terms and conditions.\n\u2022\nOur business could be adversely impacted from deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting.\n\u2022\nOur computer systems may fail or be compromised, and unanticipated problems could materially adversely impact our disaster recovery systems and business continuity plans, which could damage our reputation, impair our ability to conduct business effectively, result in enforcement action or litigation, and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInsurance and Product-Related Risks\n\u2022\nEnact Holdings may be unable to maintain or increase capital in its mortgage insurance subsidiaries in a timely manner, on anticipated terms or at all, including through improved business performance, reinsurance or similar transactions, asset sales, securities offerings or otherwise, in each case as and when required.\n\u2022\nOur financial condition, results of operations, long-term care insurance products and/or our reputation in the market may be adversely affected if our U.S. life insurance subsidiaries are unable to implement premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions on in-force\nlong-term care insurance policies by enough or quickly enough.\n\u2022\nReinsurance may not be available, affordable or adequate to protect us against losses.\n\u2022\nA decrease in the volume of high loan-to-value\nhome mortgage originations or an increase in the volume of mortgage insurance cancellations could result in a decline in Enact Holdings\u2019 revenue.\n\u2022\nThe amount of mortgage insurance written by Enact Holdings could decline significantly if alternatives to private mortgage insurance are used or lower coverage levels of mortgage insurance are selected.\n\u2022\nEnact Holdings is exposed to potential liabilities in connection with its U.S. contract underwriting services which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nEnact Holdings\u2019 delegated underwriting program may subject its mortgage insurance subsidiaries to unanticipated claims.\n\u2022\nMedical advances, such as genetic research and diagnostic imaging, and related legislation could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our life insurance, long-term care insurance and annuity businesses.\nOther General Risk\n\u2022\nThe occurrence of natural or man-made\ndisasters or a public health emergency, including pandemics, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStrategic Risks\nWe may be unable to successfully execute our strategic plans to strengthen our financial position and create long-term shareholder value.\nWe continue to pursue our overall strategy with a focus on improving business performance, reducing financial leverage and increasing financial and strategic flexibility across the organization. For information about our strategic priorities, see \u201cItem 1 - Business-Strategic Priorities.\u201d\nWe cannot be sure we will be able to successfully execute on any of our strategic priorities to effectively strengthen our financial position and create long-term shareholder value, including with respect to reducing debt of Genworth Holdings; maximizing the value of Enact Holdings; achieving economic breakeven on and stabilizing the legacy long-term care insurance in-force\nblock; advancing Genworth\u2019s long-term care growth initiatives, including launching either unilaterally or with a strategic partner new product and service offerings designed to assist individuals with navigating and financing long-term care; and returning capital to Genworth Financial shareholders.\nThere are numerous risks and constraints in our ability to achieve our strategic priorities, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nrisks on Enact Holdings\u2019 ability to pay dividends as a result of the GSEs amendments to PMIERs in response to COVID-19\nas well as additional PMIERs requirements or other restrictions that the GSEs may place on the ability of Enact Holdings to pay dividends. For additional information, see \u201cGenworth Financial and Genworth Holdings depend on the ability of their respective subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments and distributions to each of them and to meet their obligations;\u201d\n\u2022\nan inability to increase the capital needed in our businesses in a timely manner and on anticipated terms, including through improved business performance, reinsurance or similar transactions, asset sales, debt issuances, securities offerings or otherwise, in each case as and when required;\n\u2022\nour strategic priorities change or become more costly or difficult to successfully achieve than currently anticipated or the benefits achieved being less than anticipated;\n\u2022\nan inability to identify and contract with a strategic partner regarding a new long-term care insurance business;\n\u2022\nan inability to establish a new long-term care insurance business or product offerings due to commercial and/or regulatory challenges;\n\u2022\nan inability to reduce costs proportionate with Genworth\u2019s reduced business activity, including as forecasted and in a timely manner; and\n\u2022\nadverse tax or accounting charges, including new accounting guidance (that is effective for us on January 1, 2023) related to long-duration insurance contracts. See \u201c-Changes in accounting and reporting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies and insurance regulators could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d\nIf our strategic priorities become compromised due to any of the aforementioned risks (or other unnamed risks) preventing their execution, we may decide to take additional measures to increase our financial flexibility, including issuing equity at Genworth Financial which would be dilutive to our shareholders, or additional debt at Genworth Financial, Genworth Holdings or Enact Holdings (including debt convertible into equity), which could increase our leverage. The availability of any additional debt or equity funding will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory considerations, the general availability of credit and particularly\nimportant to the financial services industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity and the performance of and outlook for our company and our businesses, particularly Enact Holdings. Market conditions may make it difficult to obtain funding or complete asset sales to generate additional liquidity, especially on short notice and when the demand for additional funding in the market is high. Our access to funding may be further impaired by our credit or financial strength ratings, business prospects and our financial condition. See \u201c-Our sources of capital have become more limited, and under certain conditions we may need to seek additional capital on unfavorable terms.\u201d\nIf additional measures are taken in lieu of our strategic priorities, it could expose us to expected or unexpected adverse consequences, including adverse rating actions and adverse tax and accounting charges (such as significant losses on sale of businesses or assets or deferred acquisition costs (\u201cDAC\u201d) or deferred tax asset write-offs).\nCOVID-19\ncould materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCOVID-19\nhas brought unprecedented changes to the global economy. Large scale disruption in the U.S. economy has persisted for an extended period of time and has led to an uneven and unpredictable recovery, an imbalance in supply and demand, supply-chain shortages and a backlog of goods, a tightening labor market and a nearly 40-year\nhigh in inflation. Unemployment claims generally have returned to pre-COVID-19\nlevels, but the labor participation rate continues to be suppressed. Variability in consumer confidence due in part to the emergence of variants and the knock-on\neffects of inflation continue to create a backdrop of uncertainty in the overall macroeconomic environment. These negative macroeconomic conditions could result in lower consumer discretionary spending, which may adversely impact the sales of our products or the mortgage origination market thereby reducing demand for private mortgage insurance. The continued level of uncertainty created by COVID-19,\nincluding an inability to determine the length and timing of recovery, makes it difficult to accurately forecast the ultimate impact the pandemic will have on our business. For example, Enact Holdings has experienced high levels of borrowers entering a forbearance plan permitted under the CARES Act and by the FHFA. Although borrower forbearance has trended lower each quarter from the height of the pandemic, we are still unsure whether new variants will reverse this trend and/or if borrowers in a forbearance plan will ultimately cure or result in a claim payment. Cures associated with delinquent loans due to COVID-19\nare emerging more slowly than past natural disasters due in part to the extended forbearance programs. It is possible elevated delinquencies resulting from COVID-19\ndo not cure similar to other FEMA-declared emergencies, or as expected, which would result in higher claims and losses. If borrowers in a forbearance plan ultimately result in a claim payment, it would adversely affect Enact Holdings, including its ability to maintain compliance with PMIERs, and consequently our financial position and results of operations. Moreover, any delays in foreclosures, including foreclosure moratoriums imposed due to COVID-19,\ncould cause Enact Holdings\u2019 losses to increase as expenses accrue for longer periods and/or home values could decline during such delays. COVID-19\nresulted in a low interest rate environment during the duration of the pandemic and influenced homeowner behavior, including prioritizing homeownership and underscoring the multi-use\nbenefits of owning a home. These dynamics, among other factors, influenced refinance originations and allowed a significant number of homeowners to refinance their mortgages. High mortgage refinancing due to low interest rates, among other factors, has resulted in lower persistency in Enact Holdings. Low persistency generally results in reduced insurance in-force\nand earned premiums, which could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations. See \u201c-Interest rates and changes in rates could materially adversely affect our business and profitability.\u201d Low labor participation, unemployment/underemployment and/or forbearance resolution that results in elevated delinquencies could have an adverse effect on the private mortgage insurance industry and home prices in general, any of which may result in a material adverse impact to Enact Holdings and our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. High losses in Enact Holdings could lead to lower credit ratings and impaired capital, which could hinder Enact Holdings from offering its products, preclude it from returning capital to our holding company for prolonged periods of time, and thereby harm our liquidity. In addition, see \u201c-We may be required to increase our reserves as a result of deviations from our estimates and actuarial assumptions or other reasons, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition-Enact-Mortgage Insurance.\u201d\nWith respect to our U.S. life insurance business, we have experienced lower claim incidence and higher claim terminations in our long-term care insurance business during most of the pandemic. This experience is expected to be temporary in nature, but given the length of the pandemic, we are currently unsure when this experience will abate. It is possible that future morbidity and mortality experience could get worse due in part to delayed treatment or diagnoses, as many individuals did not seek timely treatment during the pandemic which could result in adverse healthcare outcomes that result in a claim. COVID-19\ncould hinder our ability to successfully implement in-force\nrate actions (including increased premiums and associated benefit reductions), which could result in an adverse impact to our long-term care insurance business and our financial results. In addition, COVID-19\ncould change policyholder behavior. For example, policyholders may be reluctant to receive care in a nursing home and opt for in-home\ncare. The location of care and/or the level of benefit use, among other factors, directly influence the severity of claims. Any change in policyholder behavior not considered when\noriginally pricing the product may have a material adverse impact on our future claims, including loss recognition testing, financial position and results of operations. COVID-19\ncould also disrupt medical services, including our ability to thoroughly examine benefit eligibility due to the suspension of in-person\nassessments during the duration of the pandemic.\nOur 2020 financial results were negatively impacted by COVID-19,\nmost notably due to higher incurred losses in Enact Holdings. Despite the improvement in our 2021 financial results compared to our 2020 results, we are still unsure of the ultimate impact the pandemic (including new variants) will have on our business, including our financial results, and business prospects and operations. COVID-19\ncould extend our risk exposure for a prolonged period of time and/or reintroduce prior risk exposures experience at the start of the pandemic, including interest rate and equity market volatility, high levels of unemployment, low labor participation, high levels of mortgage loan delinquencies, including in connection with programs and policies implemented by the GSEs to assist borrowers experiencing a COVID-19\nhardship, liquidity pressures, credit risk on our investment portfolio, and operational, information technology and personnel risks. We could experience significant declines in investment valuations, including as a result of credit losses and rising interest rates, and potential material asset impairments. Unexpected changes in persistency rates could emerge as policyholders and contractholders who are/were affected by the pandemic or from the ensuing adverse impacts resulting from the pandemic, including high inflation, may not be able to meet their contractual obligations, such as premium payments on insurance policies, deposits on investment products and mortgage payments on loans insured by Enact Holdings. The level of ongoing disruption and economic volatility, along with the possibility of a future global recession and the far-reaching\neffects of COVID-19\ncould cause harm to our businesses if it continues to persist. As a result of the foregoing, any of the risks identified above or other unnamed risks related to COVID-19\nmay have a material adverse impact on us, including a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Estimates, Assumptions and Valuations\nIf our reserves for future policy claims are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe calculate and maintain reserves for estimated future payments of claims to our policyholders and contractholders in accordance with U.S. GAAP and industry accounting practices. We release these reserves as those future obligations are paid, experience changes or policies lapse. The reserves we establish reflect estimates and actuarial assumptions with regard to our future experience. These estimates and actuarial assumptions involve the exercise of significant judgment. Our future financial results depend significantly upon the extent to which our actual future experience is consistent with the assumptions and methodologies we have used in pricing our products and calculating our reserves. Small changes in assumptions or small deviations of actual experience from assumptions can have, and in the past have had, material impacts on our reserves, results of operations and financial condition. Many factors, and changes in these factors, can affect future experience, including but not limited to: interest rates; investment returns and volatility; economic and social conditions, such as inflation, unemployment, home price appreciation or depreciation, and health care experience (including the type of care, and cost of care); policyholder persistency or lapses (i.e., the probability that a policy or contract will remain in-force\nfrom one period to the next); insured mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity); insured morbidity (i.e., frequency and severity of claim, including claim termination rates, claim incidence, duration of claim and benefit utilization rates); future premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions; expenses; and doctrines of legal liability and damage awards in litigation. Because these factors are not known in advance, change over time, are difficult to accurately predict and are inherently uncertain, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts we will pay for actual claims or the timing of those payments. For information regarding adequacy of reserves specifically related to our long-term care insurance, life insurance and annuities businesses, see \u201c-We may be required to increase our reserves in our long-term care insurance, life insurance and/or annuity businesses as a result of deviations from our estimates and actuarial assumptions or other reasons, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nWe regularly review our reserves and associated assumptions as part of our ongoing assessment of our business performance and risks. If we conclude that our reserves are insufficient to cover actual or expected policy and contract benefits and claim payments as a result of changes in experience, assumptions or otherwise, we would be required to increase our reserves and incur charges in the period in which we make the determination. The amounts of such increases may be significant and this could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFor additional information on reserves, including the financial impact of some of these risks, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Insurance liabilities and reserves.\u201d\nIf the models used in our businesses are inaccurate, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe employ models to, among other uses, price products, calculate reserves (including in connection with loss recognition testing), value assets, make investment decisions and generate projections used to estimate future pre-tax\nincome, as well as to evaluate risk, determine internal capital requirements and perform stress testing. These models rely on estimates and projections that are inherently uncertain, may use data and/or assumptions (that could remain locked in over an extended period of time) that do not adequately reflect recent experience and relevant industry data, and may not operate as intended. In addition, from time to time we seek to improve certain actuarial and financial models, and the conversion process may result in material changes to assumptions and financial results. The models we employ are complex, which increases our risk of error in their design, implementation or use. Also, the associated input data, assumptions and calculations and the controls we have in place to mitigate these risks may not be effective in all cases. The risks related to our models often increase when we change assumptions and/or methodologies, add or change modeling platforms or implement model changes under time constraints. These risks are exacerbated when the process for assumption changes strains our overall governance and timing around our financial reporting.\nIn our U.S. life insurance businesses, we intend to continue developing our modeling capabilities. During or after the implementation of model updates or enhancements, we may discover errors or other deficiencies in existing models, assumptions and/or methodologies. Moreover, we may use additional, more granular and detailed information through enhancements in our reserving and other processes or we may employ more simplified approaches in the future, either of which may cause us to refine or otherwise change existing assumptions and/or methodologies and thus associated reserve levels, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSpecific to Enact Holdings, models may prove to be less predictive than expected for a variety of reasons, including economic conditions that develop differently than forecasted, unexpected economic and unemployment conditions that arise from pandemics (such as COVID-19)\nor other natural disasters, changes in PMIERs, and the use of short-term financial metrics that do not reveal long-term trends. For example, COVID-19\nresulted in FEMA-declared emergencies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The unprecedented event lacks comparable data for the use in modeling. Unlike other natural disasters where the event occurs at a point in time and the rebuild starts soon after, COVID-19\nis an ongoing health crisis making it more difficult to model. As a result, Enact Holdings\u2019 modeling may vary from its experience in other historical FEMA-declared emergencies that have been more localized. Moreover, the ultimate cure rate for delinquent loans resulting from the pandemic may be lower than previously experienced in other FEMA-declared emergencies and/or lower than Enact Holdings\u2019 expectations derived from its models.\nWe may be required to increase our reserves as a result of deviations from our estimates and actuarial assumptions or other reasons, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nU.S. Life Insurance\nThe expected future profitability of our long-term care insurance, life insurance and some annuity products are based upon assumptions for, among other things, projected interest rates and investment returns, health care experience, morbidity rates, mortality rates, in-force\nrate actions, persistency, lapses and expenses. The long-term profitability of these products depends upon how our actual experience compares with our pricing and valuation assumptions. If any of our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our reserves may be inadequate, which in the past has had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business. For example, if morbidity rates are higher than our valuation assumptions, we could be required to make greater payments and thus establish additional reserves under our long-term care insurance policies than we had expected, and such amounts could be significant. Likewise, if mortality rates are lower than our valuation assumptions, we could be required to make greater payments and thus establish additional reserves under both our long-term care insurance policies and annuity contracts and such amounts could be significant. Conversely, if mortality rates are higher than our pricing and valuation assumptions, we could be required to make greater payments under our life insurance policies and annuity contracts with guaranteed minimum death benefits (\u201cGMDBs\u201d) than we had projected. Moreover, changes in the assumptions we use can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Even small changes in assumptions or small deviations of actual experience from assumptions can have, and in the past have had, material impacts on our DAC amortization, reserve levels, results of operations and financial condition.\nSee \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d and note 9 in our consolidated financial statements under \u201cItem 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information. Significant increases to our reserves may, among other things, limit our ability to execute our strategic priorities and adversely impact our credit or financial strength ratings. Any of these results could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe risk that our claims experience may differ significantly from our valuation assumptions is particularly significant for our long-term care insurance products. Long-term care insurance policies provide for long-duration coverage and, therefore, our actual claims experience will emerge over many years, or decades, after both pricing and locked-in\nvaluation assumptions have been established. For example, among other factors, changes in economic and interest rate risk, socio-demographics, behavioral trends (e.g., location of care and level of benefit use) and medical advances, may have a material adverse impact on our future claims trends. Given these inherent challenges, our ability to precisely forecast future claim costs for long-term care insurance is limited. For additional information on our long-term care insurance reserves, including the significant historical financial impact of some of these risks, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Insurance liabilities and reserves.\u201d\nThe prices and expected future profitability of our insurance and annuity products are based in part upon expected patterns of premiums, expenses and benefits, using a number of assumptions, including those related to persistency, which is the probability that a policy or contract will remain in-force\nfrom one period to the next. The effect of persistency on profitability varies for different products. For most of our life insurance and deferred annuity products, actual persistency that is lower than our persistency assumptions could have an adverse impact on profitability, primarily because we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy or contract. For our deferred annuity products with GMWBs and guaranteed annuitization benefits, actual persistency that is higher than our persistency assumptions could have an adverse impact on profitability because we could be required to make withdrawal or annuitization payments for a longer period of time than the account value would support. For our universal life insurance contracts,\nincreased persistency that is the result of the sale of contracts by the insured to third parties that continue to make premium payments on contracts that would otherwise have lapsed, also known as life settlements, could have an adverse impact on profitability because of the higher claims rate associated with settled contracts.\nFor our long-term care insurance policies, actual persistency in later policy durations that is higher than our persistency assumptions could have a negative impact on profitability. If these policies remain in-force\nlonger than we assumed, then we could be required to make greater benefit payments than we had anticipated when we priced these products. A significant number of our long-term care insurance policies have experienced higher persistency than we had originally assumed, which has resulted in higher claims and an adverse effect on the profitability of that business. In addition, the impact of inflation on claims could be more pronounced for our long-term care insurance business than our other businesses given the \u201clong tail\u201d nature of this business. To the extent inflation or other factors causes these health care costs to increase, we will be required to increase our policy and claim reserves which could negatively impact our loss recognition testing results and may result in a premium deficiency. Although we consider the potential effects of inflation when setting premium rates, our premiums may not fully offset the effects of inflation and may result in our underpricing of the risks we insure.\nThe risk that our lapse experience may differ significantly from our valuation assumptions is also significant for our term life and term universal life insurance products. These products generally have a level premium period for a specified period of years (e.g., 10 years to 30 years) after which the premium increases, which may be significant. If the frequency of lapses is higher than our reserve assumptions, we would experience higher DAC amortization and lower premiums and could experience higher benefit costs. In addition, it may be that healthy policyholders are the ones who lapse (as they can more easily replace coverage), creating adverse selection where less healthy policyholders remain in our portfolio. We have experienced both a greater frequency of policyholder lapses and more severe adverse selection, after the level premium period, and this experience could continue or worsen. As our large 10-\nand 15-year\nlevel premium period term life insurance policies written in 1999 and 2000 transitioned to their post-level guaranteed premium rate period, we have experienced lower persistency compared to our pricing and valuation assumptions which accelerated DAC amortization in previous years. In addition, as our large 20-year\nlevel premium period business written in 1999 entered its post-level period, we experienced higher lapses resulting in accelerated DAC amortization in 2019. This trend continued in the first quarter of 2020 for the 1999 block, as it reached the end of its level premium period. Additionally, we have experienced a similar trend with the 20-year\nlevel premium period business written in 2000 as it entered its post-level period during 2020 and into the first quarter of 2021 due to a 60-day\npremium grace period granted to policyholders in response to the effects of COVID-19.\nIf lapse experience on future 10-,\nand 20-year\nlevel premium period blocks emerges similar to our large 20-year\nlevel premium period business written in 1999 and 2000, we would expect volatility in DAC amortization, premiums and mortality experience, which we expect to reduce profitability in our term life insurance products, in amounts that could be material, if persistency is lower than our original assumptions. For additional information on our term life insurance reserves, including select sensitivities, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Insurance liabilities and reserves.\u201d\nAlthough some of our products permit us to increase premiums during the life of the policy or contract, we cannot guarantee that these increases would be sufficient to maintain profitability or that such increases would be approved by regulators or approved in a timely manner, where approval is required, and even if implemented the premium increases may result in higher lapses. Moreover, many of our products either do not permit us to increase premiums or limit those increases during the life of the policy or contract. Significant deviations in experience from pricing expectations could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our products. In addition to our annual reviews, we regularly review our methodologies and assumptions in light of emerging experience and may be required to make further adjustments to reserves in our long-term care insurance, life insurance and/or annuities businesses in the future. Any changes to these reserves may have a material negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nLoss recognition testing\nWe annually perform loss recognition testing for the liability for future policy benefits. Our loss recognition testing for our long-term care insurance products is reviewed in the aggregate, excluding our acquired block of long-term care insurance, which is tested separately. Our long-term care insurance business, excluding the acquired block, has positive margin which is highly dependent on the assumptions we have regarding our ability to successfully implement our in-force\nrate action plan involving premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions. We include future in-force\nrate actions in our loss recognition testing which includes assumptions for significant premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions that have been approved or are anticipated to be approved (including premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions not yet filed). A change in the expected amount of premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions would impact the results of our long-term care insurance margin testing, whereby any unexpected reduction in the amount of future in-force\nrate actions would negatively impact our margins and could result in a premium deficiency which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, capital levels, RBC and financial condition. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for the future in-force\nrate actions we have assumed in connection with our loss recognition testing. Favorable impacts on our margin from in-force\nrate actions would primarily impact our long-term care insurance block, excluding the acquired block. Due to the age of our acquired block, it would not benefit as significantly from future in-force\nrate actions. For our acquired block of long-term care insurance, the impacts of any adverse changes in assumptions are likely to be recorded as a loss as our margin for this block has been zero in the past.\nThe assumptions in our long-term care insurance products are sensitive to slight variability in actual experience and small changes in assumptions could result in the margin of our long-term care insurance block, excluding the acquired block, to decrease to at/or below zero in future years. Based on our reviews, if our margin is negative, we would be required to recognize a loss by amortizing more DAC and/or establishing additional benefit reserves, the impact of which may be material. A significant decrease in our loss recognition testing margin, the need to amortize a significant amount of DAC and/or the need to significantly increase reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For additional information on our long-term care insurance reserves, including select sensitivities, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Insurance liabilities and reserves.\u201d\nAs part of our annual loss recognition testing in our long-term care insurance products, we also review assumptions for claim incidence and severity, benefit utilization, interest rates and in-force\nrate actions, among other assumptions. We regularly review our methodologies and assumptions in light of emerging experience and may be required to make further adjustments to our long-term care insurance claim reserves in the future, which could also impact our loss recognition testing results.\nSimilar to our long-term care insurance products, we annually perform loss recognition testing for our term and whole life insurance products in the aggregate, excluding our acquired block and certain reinsured blocks, which are tested separately. The margin of our term and whole life insurance products has fluctuated over the years. Any adverse changes in our assumptions could negatively impact the combined margin of our term and whole life insurance products. To the extent, based on reviews, our margin is negative for our term and whole life insurance products, excluding our acquired block and certain reinsured blocks, our acquired block of term and whole life insurance products or certain reinsured blocks, we would be required to recognize a loss by amortizing more DAC and/or present value of future profits (\u201cPVFP\u201d) as well as the establishment of additional future policy benefit reserves if the DAC and/or PVFP was fully written off. A significant decrease in our loss recognition testing margin, the need to amortize a significant amount of DAC and/or PVFP or the need to significantly increase reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For additional information on our term life insurance reserves, including select sensitivities, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Insurance liabilities and reserves.\u201d\nWe will continue to monitor our experience and assumptions closely and make changes to our assumptions and methodologies, as appropriate, for our U.S. life insurance products. As experience has emerged in the past, we have made resulting changes to our assumptions that have had a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Our experience will continue to emerge and it is likely that future assumption reviews will result in further updates.\nCash flow testing\nWe also perform cash flow testing or \u201casset adequacy analysis\u201d separately for each of our U.S. life insurance companies on a statutory accounting basis. To the extent that the cash flow testing margin is negative in any of our U.S. life insurance companies, we would need to increase statutory reserves in that company, which would decrease our RBC ratios.\nAs a part of our cash flow testing process for our life insurance subsidiaries, we consider incremental benefits from expected future in-force\nrate actions in our long-term care insurance products that would help mitigate the impact of deteriorating experience. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for the future in-force\nrate actions we assumed in connection with our cash flow testing for our life insurance subsidiaries. A need to significantly further increase statutory reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe NYDFS, which regulates GLICNY, our New York insurance subsidiary, also requires specific adequacy testing scenarios that are generally more severe than those deemed acceptable in other states. Moreover, the required testing scenarios by the NYDFS have a disproportionate impact on our long-term care insurance products. In addition, we have historically used nationwide experience for setting assumptions in our long-term care insurance products in cash flow testing for all of our legal entities, including GLICNY.\nWe have been monitoring emerging experience with our GLICNY policyholders, as their experience has been adverse as compared to our nationwide experience. With the benefit of additional data and analysis, and based on discussions with the NYDFS, we began using assumptions that reflect GLICNY specific experience in its asset adequacy analysis in 2020. After discussions with the NYDFS and through the exercise of professional actuarial judgment, GLICNY also incorporated in its 2021 and 2020 asset adequacy analysis assumptions for future in-force\nrate actions for long-term care insurance products to offset the emerging adverse experience for these products. With these assumption updates, GLICNY\u2019s 2021 and 2020 asset adequacy analysis produced a negative margin. To address the negative margin, GLICNY recorded an incremental $68 million and $100 million of additional statutory reserves in 2021 and 2020, respectively. This resulted in RBC of 200% for GLICNY as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. For additional information on GLICNY asset adequacy testing, see note 17 in our consolidated financial statements under \u201cItem 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nSignificant adverse assumption changes could result in the cash flow testing margin in GLICNY to decrease to at/or below zero in future years. In addition, the NYDFS generally does not permit in-force\nrate increases for long-term care insurance to be used in asset adequacy analysis until such increases have been approved. However, the NYDFS has allowed GLICNY to incorporate recently filed in-force\nrate actions in its asset adequacy analysis prior to approval in the past and, in 2021 and 2020, allowed GLICNY to incorporate assumptions for future in-force\nrate actions in its asset adequacy analysis. If the NYDFS no longer allows GLICNY to incorporate assumptions for future in-force\nrate actions in its asset adequacy analysis to offset New York specific experience, this would result in a material decrease in GLICNY\u2019s cash flow testing margin and would require GLICNY to significantly increase its statutory reserves further. This would have a material adverse effect on GLICNY\u2019s financial condition and RBC ratio.\nFor additional information regarding impacts to statutory capital as a result of reserve increases, see \u201c-An adverse change in our regulatory requirements, including risk-based capital, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nEnact-Mortgage Insurance\nThe establishment of loss reserves for Enact Holdings and its mortgage insurance subsidiaries is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires significant judgment and numerous assumptions. Enact Holdings establishes loss reserves using its best estimate of the rates at which delinquencies go to claim (\u201cclaim rates\u201d) and claim severity to calculate estimated losses on loans reported as being in default as of the end of each reporting period. The sources of uncertainty affecting estimates are numerous and include both internal and external factors. Internal factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the mix of exposures, loss mitigation activities and claim settlement practices. Significant external factors include changes in general economic conditions, such as, home prices, unemployment/underemployment, interest rates, tax policy, credit availability, government housing policies, government and GSE loss mitigation and mortgage forbearance programs, state foreclosure timelines, GSE and state foreclosure moratoriums and types of mortgage products. Because assumptions related to these factors are not known in advance, change over time, are difficult to accurately predict and are inherently uncertain, Enact Holdings cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts it will pay for actual claims or the timing of those payments. Even in a stable economic environment, the actual claim payments made may be substantially different and even materially exceed the amount of the corresponding loss reserves for such claims. Enact Holdings regularly review its reserves and associated assumptions as part of its ongoing assessment of business performance and risks. If Enact Holdings conclude its reserves are insufficient to cover actual or expected claim payments as a result of changes in experience, assumptions or otherwise, it would be required to increase its reserves and incur charges in the period in which the determination was made. The amounts of such increases could be significant and this may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Small changes in assumptions or small deviations of actual experience from assumptions can have, and in the past have had, material impacts on our reserves, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, sudden and/or unexpected deterioration of economic conditions, including as a result of COVID-19,\nmay cause estimates of loss reserves to be materially understated. Enact Holdings has experienced a significant increase in loss reserves as compared to pre-COVID\ntime periods, driven mostly by higher new delinquencies from borrower forbearance due to COVID-19.\nA large portion of these delinquencies are expected to cure; however, reserves recorded related to borrower forbearance rely on a high degree of estimation and assumptions that lack comparable historic data. Therefore, it is possible Enact Holdings could record higher losses related to these loss reserves if they do not cure as expected. Accordingly, delinquencies, loss reserves and losses are expected to remain volatile and could increase or decrease, due to a variety of factors, including from borrowers\u2019 exiting forbearance programs upon reaching the maximum term of forbearance and depending on the level and speed of economic recovery from COVID-19,\nincluding as a result of labor participation, changes in consumer behavior and government assistance initiatives. Furthermore, consistent with industry practice, Enact Holdings does not record losses on insured loans that are not in default. Therefore, future potential losses may develop from loans not currently in default. To the extent actual losses are greater than current loss reserves or if loans in default ultimately become delinquent and go to claim, it would material adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and restrict Enact Holdings\u2019 ability to distribute dividends to our holding companies thereby negatively impacting our liquidity.\nEnact Holdings establishes premium rates for the duration of a mortgage insurance certificate upon issuance and cannot adjust the premiums after a certificate is issued. As a result, Enact Holdings cannot offset the impact of unanticipated claims with premium increases on coverage in-force.\nEnact Holdings\u2019 premium rates vary with the perceived risk of a claim and prepayment on the insured loan and are developed using models based on long term historical experience, which takes into account a number of factors including, but not limited to, the loan-to-value\nratio, whether the mortgage provides for fixed payments or variable payments, the term of the mortgage, the borrower\u2019s credit history, the borrower\u2019s income and assets, and home price appreciation. In the event the premiums Enact Holdings charges does not adequately compensate them for the risks and costs associated with the coverage they provide, including costs associated with unforeseen higher claims, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the present value of future profits, which would increase our expenses and reduce profitability.\nDAC represents costs related to the successful acquisition of our insurance policies and investment contracts, which are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related insurance policies and investment contracts. These costs primarily consist of commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions and underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses incurred on policies and contracts successfully acquired. Under U.S. GAAP, DAC is subsequently amortized to income, over the lives of the underlying contracts, in relation to the anticipated recognition of premiums or gross profits. In addition, when we acquire a block of insurance policies or investment contracts, we assign a portion of the purchase price to the right to receive future net cash flows from the acquired block of insurance and investment contracts and policies. This intangible asset, called PVFP, represents the actuarially estimated present value of future cash flows from the acquired policies. We amortize the value of this intangible asset in a manner similar to the amortization of DAC.\nOur amortization of DAC and PVFP generally depends upon, among other items, anticipated profits from investments, surrender and other policy and contract charges, mortality, morbidity and maintenance expense margins. Unfavorable experience with regard to expected expenses, investment returns, mortality, morbidity, withdrawals or lapses may cause us to increase the amortization of DAC or PVFP, or both, or to record a charge to increase benefit reserves, and such increases could be material. For additional information regarding impacts to DAC as a result of lapses of our term life insurance products, see \u201c-We may be required to increase our reserves in our long-term care insurance, life insurance and/or annuity businesses as a result of deviations from our estimates and actuarial assumptions or other reasons, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nWe regularly review DAC and PVFP to determine if they are recoverable from future income. If these costs are not recoverable, they are charged as expenses in the financial period in which we make this determination. If we determine that we are unable to recover DAC from profits over the life of a block of insurance policies or annuity contracts, or if withdrawals or surrender charges associated with early withdrawals do not fully offset the unamortized acquisition costs related to those policies or annuities, we would be required to recognize the additional DAC amortization as an expense in the current period. For example, in 2021 and 2020, we recorded DAC impairments of $117 million and $63 million, respectively, in our universal life insurance products due principally to lower future estimated gross profits. Equity market volatility could result in losses in our variable annuity products and associated hedging programs which could challenge our ability to recover DAC on these products and could lead to further write-offs of DAC.\nFor additional information on DAC and PVFP, including the financial impact of some of these risks, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d and notes 6 and 7 in our consolidated financial statements under \u201cItem 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nWhen we have projected profits in earlier years followed by projected losses in later years (as is currently the case with our long-term care insurance business), we are required to increase our reserve liabilities over time to offset the projected future losses, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe calculate and maintain reserves for estimated future payments of claims to our policyholders and contractholders in accordance with U.S. GAAP and industry accounting practices. When we conclude that our reserves are insufficient by line of business to cover actual or expected policy and contract benefits and claim payments as a result of changes in experience, assumptions or otherwise, we are required to increase our reserves and incur charges in the period in which we make the determination. For certain long-duration products in our U.S. Life Insurance segment, we are also required to accrue additional reserves over time when the overall reserve is adequate by line of business, but profits are projected in earlier years followed by losses projected in\nlater years. When this pattern of profits followed by losses exists for these products, and we determine that an additional reserve liability is required, we increase reserves in the years we expect to be profitable by the amounts necessary to offset losses projected in later years.\nIn our long-term care insurance products, projected profits followed by projected losses are anticipated to occur because U.S. GAAP requires that original assumptions be used in determining reserves for future policy claims unless and until a premium deficiency exists. Our existing locked-in\nreserve assumptions do not include assumptions for premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions, which if included in reserves, could reduce or eliminate future projected losses. As a result of this pattern of projected profits followed by projected losses, we are required to accrue additional future policy benefit reserves in the profitable years, currently expected to be through 2031, by the amounts necessary to offset losses in later years. The accrual is recorded on a quarterly basis using assumptions which are updated annually at the time we perform loss recognition testing and is impacted by the reserve pattern and the present value of expected future losses. Likewise, the accrual is subject to significant estimation and includes various assumptions that are sensitive to variability; small changes in assumptions could result in volatility of the accrued amount in any given year. Moreover, the amount required to accrue for additional future policy benefits in the profitable years may be significant and this could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. For example, during 2021, favorable earnings resulted in the accrual of additional pre-tax\nincremental reserves of $649 million for profits followed by losses. For additional information, including the financial impact of some of these risks, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Future policy benefits.\u201d\nOur valuation of fixed maturity and equity securities uses methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to change and differing interpretations which could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe report fixed maturity and equity securities at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. These securities represent the majority of our total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and invested assets. Our portfolio of fixed maturity securities consists primarily of investment grade securities. Valuations use inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation, as well as valuation methods that are more complex or require greater estimation, thereby resulting in values that are less certain and may vary significantly from the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. The methodologies, estimates and assumptions we use in valuing our investment securities evolve over time and are subject to different interpretation (including based on developments in relevant accounting literature), all of which can lead to changes in the value of our investment securities. Rapidly changing and unanticipated interest rate, external macroeconomic, credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of investment securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements, and the period-to-period\nchanges in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe extent of the benefits Enact Holdings realizes from its future loss mitigation actions or programs may be limited.\nAs part of its loss mitigation efforts, Enact Holdings periodically investigates insured loans and evaluates the related servicing to ensure compliance with applicable guidelines and to detect possible fraud or misrepresentation. As a result of these periodic investigations, Enact Holdings has rescinded coverage on loans that do not meet its guidelines in the past, and based on future investigations, may rescind future coverage. In the past, Enact Holdings recognized significant benefits from taking action on these investigations and evaluations under its master policies. However, the PMIERs rescission relief principles, which have been incorporated into Enact Holdings\u2019 mortgage insurance policies since 2014, limit its rescission rights for underwriting defects and misrepresentation, including when a borrower makes a certain number of timely mortgage payments. Therefore, Enact Holdings may be unable to recognize the same level of future benefits from rescission actions as it did in years prior to 2014. In addition, mortgage insurers\u2019 rescission rights and certain other rights have been\ntemporarily impaired due to accommodations made in connection with COVID-19.\nEven prior to COVID-19,\nthe mortgage finance industry (with government support) adopted various programs to modify delinquent loans to make them more affordable to borrowers with the goal of reducing the number of foreclosures. The ultimate impact from a loan modification depends on re-default\nrates, which can be affected by factors such as changes in home values and unemployment. The estimate of the number of loans qualifying for modification programs is based on management\u2019s judgment as informed by past experience and current market conditions but are inherently uncertain. Enact Holdings cannot predict what the actual volume of loan modifications will be or the ultimate re-default\nrate, and therefore, cannot be certain whether these efforts will provide material benefits. It is possible Enact Holdings may be unable to recognize meaningful benefits from loss mitigation activities which could result in higher losses and adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.\nLiquidity, Financial Strength and Credit Ratings, and Counterparty and Credit Risks\nGenworth Financial and Genworth Holdings depend on the ability of their respective subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments and distributions to each of them and to meet their obligations.\nGenworth Financial and Genworth Holdings each act as a holding company for their respective subsidiaries and do not have business operations of their own. Dividends from their respective subsidiaries, permitted payments to them under tax sharing and expense reimbursement arrangements with their subsidiaries and proceeds from borrowings are their principal sources of cash to meet their obligations. These obligations principally include operating expenses and interest and principal payments on current and future borrowings. If the cash Genworth Financial or Genworth Holdings receives from their respective subsidiaries pursuant to dividends and tax sharing and expense reimbursement arrangements is insufficient to fund any of their obligations, or if a subsidiary is unable or unwilling for any reason to pay dividends to either of them, Genworth Financial or Genworth Holdings would be required to raise cash through, among other things, the incurrence of debt (including convertible or exchangeable debt), the sale of assets or the issuance of equity.\nOur holding companies\u2019 liquidity and capital positions are highly dependent on the performance of Enact Holdings and its ability to pay future dividends. Although the business performance and financial results of our U.S. life insurance subsidiaries have improved significantly, they currently have negative unassigned surplus of approximately $1.0 billion under statutory accounting and as a result, we do not expect these subsidiaries to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. Enact Holdings\u2019 evaluation of future dividend payments to Genworth Holdings and our holding companies overall resulting liquidity plans are subject to and dependent on, among other things, current and future market conditions, Enact Holdings\u2019 business performance and capital preservation, including as a result of COVID-19,\ncorporate law restrictions, insurance laws and regulations, Enact Holdings ability to maintain adequate capital to meet its current and future requirements mandated by PMIERs, including restrictions imposed by the GSEs on Enact Holdings, business and regulatory approvals and the overall economic recovery from COVID-19.\nFurthermore, any future dividends distributed by Enact Holdings will also include a proportionate dividend distribution to minority shareholders.\nFor additional details on PMIERs and risks associated with an inability to meet its requirements, see \u201c-If Enact Holdings is unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs because the GSEs amend them or the GSEs\u2019 interpretation of the financial requirements requires Enact Holdings to hold amounts of capital that are higher than planned or otherwise, Enact Holdings may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d and \u201cRegulation-Enact-Mortgage Insurance Regulation.\u201d\nIn general, dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed \u201cextraordinary\u201d and require insurance regulatory approval. In addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends or other payments by the insurance subsidiaries (such as a payment under a tax sharing agreement or for employee or other services, including expense reimbursements) if they determine that such payment could be adverse to policyholders or contractholders.\nGenworth Financial has the right to appoint a majority of directors to the board of directors of Enact Holdings; however, actions taken by Enact Holdings and its board of directors (including in the case of the payment of dividends, the approval of Enact Holdings\u2019 independent capital committee) are subject to and may be limited by the interests of Enact Holdings, including but not limited to, its use of capital for growth opportunities and regulatory requirements.\nOur sources of capital have become more limited, and under certain conditions we may need to seek additional capital on unfavorable terms.\nAlthough Genworth Financial and Genworth Holdings made significant improvements to their overall financial condition during 2021, including the retirement of $2.1 billion of holding company debt and other obligations, they still need liquidity to pay operating expenses, principal and interest on debt, and other obligations. As of December 31, 2021, Genworth Holdings had approximately $1.2 billion of outstanding debt that matures between 2024 and 2066, including $0.3 billion that matures in February 2024. Given the sales of Genworth Australia and Genworth Canada, and our expectation that we will not receive dividends from our U.S. life insurance businesses for the foreseeable future, we are reliant on dividends from Enact Holdings and intercompany tax payments to fund holding company obligations. Absent receiving dividends from Enact Holdings and intercompany tax payments from our subsidiaries as anticipated, we would likely need to access additional liquidity through third party sources. However, we may not be able to raise capital and/or borrowings on favorable terms, based on our credit ratings and business prospects. There is no guarantee that any of these factors will improve in the future when we would seek additional capital. Disruptions, volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets and downgrades in our credit ratings may force us to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than would be optimal, bear an unattractive cost of capital or be unable to raise capital at any price. Furthermore, the availability of raising additional capital, including through additional minority equity offerings of Enact Holdings or the issuance of debt, convertible or equity-linked securities, could depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, regulatory considerations, the general availability of credit, the level of activity and availability of reinsurance, our credit ratings and credit capacity and the performance of and outlook for Enact Holdings. Market conditions and a variety of other factors may make it difficult or impracticable to generate additional liquidity on favorable terms or at all. Any failure to repay or refinance our debt or meet our financial obligations as they become due would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not currently have a revolving credit facility at the Genworth Holdings level to provide liquidity. To the extent we need additional funding to satisfy our additional liquidity needs, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into a new credit facility on terms (or at targeted amounts) acceptable to us or at all.\nSimilarly, market conditions and a variety of other factors may make it difficult or impracticable to generate additional liquidity through asset sales or the issuance of additional equity, and any issuance of equity in such circumstances could be highly dilutive to our stockholders.\nFor a further discussion of our liquidity, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nAdverse rating agency actions have resulted in a loss of business and adversely affected our results of operations, financial condition and business and future adverse rating actions could have a further and more significant adverse impact on us.\nFinancial strength ratings, which various rating agencies publish as measures of an insurance company\u2019s ability to meet contractholder and policyholder obligations, are important to maintaining public confidence in our products, the ability to market our products and our competitive position. Credit ratings, which rating agencies publish as measures of an entity\u2019s ability to repay its indebtedness, are important to our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt and other forms of credit and to the cost of such financing.\nOver the course of the last several years prior to 2021, the ratings of our holding companies and all of our insurance subsidiaries were downgraded, placed on negative outlook and/or put on review for potential downgrade on various occasions. A ratings downgrade, negative outlook or review could occur again for a variety of reasons, including reasons specifically related to our company, generally related to our industry or the broader financial services industry or as a result of changes by the rating agencies in their methodologies or rating criteria. A negative outlook on our ratings or a downgrade in any of our financial strength or credit ratings, the announcement of a potential downgrade, negative outlook or review, or customer, investor, regulator or other concerns about the possibility of a downgrade, negative outlook or review, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nSee \u201cItem 1 - Business-Ratings\u201d for information regarding the current financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries.\nThe direct or indirect effects of such adverse ratings actions or any future actions could include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nceasing and/or reducing new sales of our products or limiting the business opportunities we are presented with;\n\u2022\nadversely affecting our relationships with distributors, including the loss of exclusivity under certain agreements with our independent sales intermediaries and distribution partners;\n\u2022\ncausing us to lose key distributors that have ratings requirements that we may no longer satisfy (or resulting in our renegotiation of new, less favorable arrangements with those distributors);\n\u2022\nrequiring us to modify some of our existing products or services to remain competitive, including reducing premiums we charge or introduce new products or services;\n\u2022\nmaterially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders, withdrawals and loans by contractholders and policyholders;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to post additional collateral for our derivatives or hedging agreements tied to the credit ratings of our holding companies;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to provide support, or to arrange for third-party support, in the form of collateral, capital contributions or letters of credit under the terms of certain of our reinsurance and other agreements, or otherwise securing our commercial counterparties for the perceived risk of our financial strength;\n\u2022\nadversely affecting our ability to maintain reinsurance or obtain new reinsurance or obtain it on reasonable pricing and other terms;\n\u2022\nincreasing the capital charge associated with affiliated investments within certain of our U.S. life insurance businesses thereby lowering capital and RBC of these subsidiaries and negatively impacting our financial flexibility;\n\u2022\nregulators requiring certain of our subsidiaries to maintain additional capital, limiting thereby our financial flexibility and requiring us to raise additional capital;\n\u2022\nadversely affecting our ability to raise capital;\n\u2022\nincreased scrutiny by the GSEs and/or by customers, potentially resulting in a decrease in the amount of new insurance written;\n\u2022\nincreasing our cost of borrowing and making it more difficult to borrow in the public debt markets or enter into a credit agreement; and\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult to execute our strategic priorities.\nUnder PMIERs, the GSEs require maintenance of at least one rating with a rating agency acceptable to the respective GSEs. The current PMIERs do not include a specific ratings requirement with respect to eligibility,\nbut if this were to change in the future, Enact Holdings may become subject to a ratings requirement in order to retain their eligibility status under PMIERs. Ratings downgrades that result in the inability of Enact Holdings to insure new mortgage loans sold to the GSEs, or the transfer by the GSEs of its existing policies to an alternative mortgage insurer, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See \u201c-If Enact Holdings is unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs because the GSEs amend them or the GSEs\u2019 interpretation of the financial requirements requires Enact Holdings to hold amounts of capital that are higher than planned or otherwise, Enact Holdings may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition\u201d for additional information regarding the requirements under PMIERs. Relationships with mortgage insurance customers may be adversely affected by the ratings assigned to Genworth Holdings, Enact Holdings or our principal insurance subsidiaries which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, GMICO, our principal U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiary, has financial strength ratings below its competitors. Any assigned financial strength rating that remains below other private mortgage insurers could hinder our competitiveness in the marketplace and could result in an adverse impact to our business. Moreover, any future downgrade in the financial strength ratings of GMICO or the announcement of a potential downgrade could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDefaults by counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements or to derivative instruments we use to hedge our business risks, or defaults by us on agreements we have with these counterparties, may expose us to risks we sought to mitigate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe routinely execute reinsurance and derivative transactions with reinsurers, brokers/dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional counterparties to mitigate our risks in various circumstances and to hedge various business risks. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client or change in collateral value. Reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. We cannot be sure that our reinsurers will pay the reinsurance recoverable owed to us now or in the future or that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis. A reinsurer\u2019s insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Collateral is often posted by the counterparty to offset this risk; however, we bear the risk that the collateral declines in value or otherwise is inadequate to fully compensate us in the event of a default. We also enter into a variety of derivative instruments, including options, swaps, forwards, and interest rate and currency swaps with a number of counterparties. If our counterparties fail or refuse to honor their obligations under the derivative instruments, and collateral posted, if any, is inadequate, our hedges of the related risk will be ineffective. In addition, if we trigger downgrade provisions on risk-hedging or reinsurance arrangements, the counterparties to these arrangements may be able to terminate our arrangements with them or require us to take other measures, such as post additional collateral, contribute capital or provide letters of credit. We have agreed to new terms with almost all of our counterparties concerning our collateral arrangements given our low ratings and, in most cases, agreed to post excess collateral to maintain our existing derivative agreements. Moreover, the new terms also removed the credit downgrade provisions from all of the insurance company master swap agreements and replaced them with a provision that allows the counterparty to terminate the derivative transaction if the RBC ratio of the applicable insurance company goes below a certain threshold. Although we believe this has allowed us to maintain effective hedging relationships with our counterparties, it has added additional strain on liquidity and collateral sufficiency. Furthermore, there is no assurance that we can maintain these current arrangements in the foreseeable future or at all. If counterparties exercise their rights to terminate transactions, we may be required to make cash payments to the counterparty based on the current contract value, which would hinder our ability to manage future risks.\nWe ceded to UFLIC our in-force\nstructured settlements block of business issued prior to 2004, certain variable annuity business issued prior to 2004 and the long-term care insurance business assumed from legal\nentities now a part of Brighthouse Life Insurance Company. UFLIC has established trust accounts for our benefit to secure its obligations under the reinsurance arrangements. GE is obligated to maintain UFLIC\u2019s RBC above a specified minimum level pursuant to a Capital Maintenance Agreement. If UFLIC becomes insolvent notwithstanding this agreement, and the amounts in the trust accounts are insufficient to pay UFLIC\u2019s obligations to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The loss of material risk-hedging or reinsurance arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For additional information on UFLIC reinsurance, see note 8 in our consolidated financial statements under \u201cItem 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nDefaults or other events impacting the value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio may reduce our income.\nWe are subject to the risk that the issuers or guarantors of investment securities we own may default on principal or interest payments they owe us. As of December 31, 2021, fixed maturity securities of $60.4 billion in our investment portfolio represented 82% of our total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and invested assets. Events reducing the value of our investment portfolio other than on a temporary basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Levels of write-downs or expected credit losses are impacted by our assessment of the financial condition of the issuer, whether or not the issuer is expected to pay its principal and interest obligations, our expected recoveries in the event of a default or circumstances that would require us to sell securities which have declined in value.\nRisks Relating to Economic and Market Conditions\nInterest rates and changes in rates could materially adversely affect our business and profitability.\nOur products and investment portfolio are impacted by interest rate fluctuations and/or a sustained period of low interest rates. In recent years, historic low interest rates have adversely impacted our business, reserves (including margins) and profitability. For example, in 2019, we performed loss recognition testing and determined that we had a premium deficiency in our fixed immediate annuity products primarily driven by the low interest rate environment. For additional information, including the historical financial impact of the premium deficiencies, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Future policy benefits.\u201d Sustained low interest rates also impacted our long-term care insurance margin, which is sensitive to assumption changes, including future investment returns. If interest rates remain at historic lows, our future profitability and business could be adversely impacted.\nOur insurance and investment products are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations and expose us to the risk that declines in interest rates or tightening credit spreads will reduce our interest rate margin (the difference between the returns we earn on the investments that support our obligations under these products and the amounts that we pay to policyholders and contractholders). We may reduce the interest rates we credit on most of these products only at limited, pre-established\nintervals, and some contracts have guaranteed minimum interest crediting rates. As a result of recent historic low interest rates, declines in our interest rate margin on these products have adversely impacted our business and profitability.\nDuring periods of increasing market interest rates, we may increase crediting rates on interest-sensitive in-force\nproducts, such as universal life insurance and fixed annuities. Rapidly rising interest rates may lead to increased policy surrenders, withdrawals from life insurance policies and annuity contracts and requests for policy loans, as policyholders and contractholders shift assets into higher yielding investments. Increases in crediting rates, as well as surrenders and withdrawals, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including the requirement to liquidate fixed-income investments in an unrealized loss position to satisfy surrenders or withdrawals.\nFor mortgage insurance products included in Enact Holdings, declining interest rates historically have increased the rate at which borrowers refinance their existing mortgages, resulting in cancellations of the mortgage insurance covering the refinanced loans. Declining interest rates have also contributed to home price appreciation, which may provide borrowers in the United States with the option of cancelling their mortgage insurance coverage earlier than we anticipated when pricing that coverage. In addition, during 2021 and 2020 as a result of the low interest rate environment, Enact Holdings experienced a decline in persistency rates. Lower persistency rates result in reduced insurance in-force\nand earned premiums, which could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations. See \u201c-A decrease in the volume of high loan-to-value\nhome mortgage originations or an increase in the volume of mortgage insurance cancellations could result in a decline in our revenue in our mortgage insurance subsidiaries.\u201d\nRising interest rates generally reduce the volume of new mortgage originations. A decline in the volume of new mortgage originations would have an adverse effect on Enact Holdings\u2019 new insurance written. Rising interest rates also can increase the monthly mortgage payments for homeowners with insured loans that have adjustable rate mortgages (\u201cARMs\u201d) that could have the effect of increasing default rates on ARM loans, thereby increasing Enact Holdings\u2019 exposure on its mortgage insurance policies. Higher interest rates can lead to an increase in defaults as borrowers at risk of default will find it harder to qualify for a replacement loan. Rising interest rates can also have a negative impact on home prices, which increases our risk of loss. See \u201c-A deterioration in economic conditions or a decline in home prices may adversely affect Enact Holdings\u2019 loss experience.\u201d\nInterest rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolio, by increasing reinvestment risk and reducing our ability to achieve adequate investment returns. During periods of declining market interest rates, the interest we receive on variable interest rate investments decreases. In addition, during those periods, we reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower-yielding high-grade instruments or in lower-credit instruments to maintain comparable returns. Issuers of fixed-income securities may decide to prepay their obligations in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates our reinvestment risk. Low interest rates reduce the returns we earn on the investments that support our obligations under long-term care insurance, life insurance and annuity products, which increases reinvestment risk and reduces our ability to achieve our targeted investment returns. The pricing and expected future profitability of these products are based in part on expected investment returns. Generally, life and long-term care insurance products are expected to initially produce positive cash flows as customers pay periodic premiums, which we invest as they are received. The premiums, along with accumulated investment earnings, are needed to pay claims, which are generally expected to exceed premiums in later years. Low interest rates increase reinvestment risk and reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins and adversely affects the profitability of our life insurance, long-term care insurance and fixed annuity products and may increase hedging costs on our in-force\nblock of variable annuity products. Given the average life of our assets is shorter than the average life of the liabilities on these products, our reinvestment risk is also greater in low interest rate environments as a significant portion of cash flows used to pay benefits to our policyholders and contractholders comes from investment returns. During periods of increasing interest rates, market values of lower-yielding assets will decline resulting in unrealized losses on our investment portfolio. In addition, our interest rate hedges could decline which would require us to post additional collateral with our derivative counterparties. Posting additional collateral could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations by reducing our liquidity and net investment income, to the extent that the additional collateral posting requires us to invest in higher-quality, lower-yielding investments.\nA low interest rate environment also negatively impacts the sufficiency of our margins on both our DAC and PVFP. If interest rates remain at historic lows for a prolonged period, it could result in an impairment of these assets, and may reduce funds available to pay claims, including life and long-term care insurance claims, requiring an increase in our reserve liabilities, which could be significant. In addition, certain statutory capital requirements for our U.S. life insurance companies are based on models that consider interest rates. Prolonged\nperiods of low interest rates may increase the statutory reserves we are required to hold as well as the amount of assets and capital we must maintain to support amounts of statutory reserves in these companies.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced its intention to transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), with its full elimination to occur after June 2023. Although, we have terminated the majority of our LIBOR-based derivative instruments and entered into alternative rate swaps, we still have certain LIBOR-based debt (Junior Subordinated Notes and Federal Home Loan Bank loans), reinsurance agreements and institutional products within the Runoff segment. Uncertainty remains surrounding the final cessation and transition away from LIBOR and we cannot predict the ultimate impact the elimination of LIBOR will have on financial markets, nor our reinsurance agreements and liquidity; however, it is possible we may be unable to negotiate or amend our existing contracts with terms that are favorable to us which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Investments and Derivative Instruments\u201d for additional information about the transition from LIBOR.\nSee \u201cPart II-Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for additional information about interest rate risk.\nA deterioration in economic conditions or a decline in home prices may adversely affect Enact Holdings\u2019 loss experience.\nLoss experience in Enact Holdings generally result from adverse economic events, such as a borrower\u2019s reduction of income, unemployment, underemployment, divorce, illness, inability to manage credit, or a change in interest rate levels or home values, that reduce a borrower\u2019s willingness or ability to continue to make mortgage payments. Rising unemployment rates and deterioration in economic conditions, including as a result of COVID-19,\nincrease the likelihood of borrower defaults and can also adversely affect housing values, which increases our risk of loss. A decline in home values typically makes it more difficult for borrowers to sell or refinance their homes, increasing the likelihood of a default followed by a claim if borrowers experience a job loss or other life events that reduce their incomes or increase their expenses. In addition, declines in home values may also decrease the willingness of borrowers with sufficient financial resources to make mortgage payments when their mortgage balances exceed the values of their homes. Declines in home values typically increase the severity of claims Enact Holdings may pay. A decline in home prices, whether or not in conjunction with deteriorating economic conditions, may increase the risk of loss. Over the last five years beginning in 2017, home prices have steadily risen, and in many geographic locations, home price appreciation has outpaced borrower incomes. Given this steady rise in home price and uneven price-to-income\nratio that has exacerbated housing affordability, Enact Holdings could experience a higher frequency and severity of claims should home values decline in 2022 or subsequent years. Declining home values erode the value of the underlying collateral and reduce the likelihood that foreclosed homes can be sold for an amount sufficient to offset the unpaid principal and interest which may adversely impact Enact Holdings\u2019 loss mitigation activities. Furthermore, Enact Holdings\u2019 estimates of claims-paying resources and claim obligations are based on various assumptions, including but not limited to, the timing of receipt of claims on delinquent loans, estimates of future claims that will ultimately be received, the ultimate resolution of borrower forbearance plans, including whether borrowers in forbearance cure or result in a claim payment, anticipated loss mitigation activities, premiums, housing prices and unemployment rates. These assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty and require judgment. Any of these events may have a material adverse effect on Enact Holdings which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe ultimate amount of the loss suffered depends, in part, on whether the home of a borrower who defaults on a mortgage can be sold for an amount that will cover the unpaid principal balance, interest and the expenses of the sale. In previous economic slowdowns in the United States, a pronounced weakness in the housing market ensued, as well as declines in home prices. These economic slowdowns and the resulting impact on the housing market drove high levels of delinquencies in Enact Holdings. Any delays in foreclosure processes, including\nforeclosure moratoriums due to COVID-19,\ncould cause Enact Holdings\u2019 losses to increase as expenses accrue for longer periods or if the value of foreclosed homes further decline during such delays. If Enact Holdings experiences a higher number and/or severity of delinquencies than expected, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nOur insurance businesses are extensively regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth.\nOur insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations and are extensively regulated. State insurance laws regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled and licensed. Our international operations, predominantly located in Mexico, are principally regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled. Failure to comply with applicable regulations or to obtain or maintain appropriate authorizations or exemptions under any applicable laws could result in restrictions on our ability to do business or engage in activities regulated in one or more jurisdictions in which we operate and could subject us to fines and other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the nature and extent of regulation of our activities in applicable jurisdictions could materially change causing a material adverse effect on our business.\nInsurance regulatory authorities have broad administrative powers, which at times, are coordinated and communicated across regulatory bodies. These administrative powers include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nlicensing companies and agents to transact business;\n\u2022\ncalculating the value of assets and determining the eligibility of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements;\n\u2022\nmandating certain insurance benefits;\n\u2022\nregulating certain premium rates;\n\u2022\nreviewing and approving policy forms;\n\u2022\nregulating discrimination in pricing and coverage terms and unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements;\n\u2022\nestablishing and revising statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards;\n\u2022\nfixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts;\n\u2022\napproving premium increases and associated benefit reductions;\n\u2022\nevaluating enterprise risk to an insurer;\n\u2022\napproving changes in control of insurance companies;\n\u2022\nrestricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates;\n\u2022\nregulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments;\n\u2022\nrestricting the types of insurance products that may be offered; and\n\u2022\nimposing insurance eligibility criteria.\nState insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly re-examine\nexisting laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to SAP, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and\nregulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Any adopted future legislation or NAIC regulations, including as a result of COVID-19\nor regulations to address climate change, may be more restrictive on our ability to conduct business than current regulatory requirements or may result in higher costs or increased statutory capital and reserve requirements. Further, because laws and regulations can be complex and sometimes inexact, there is also a risk that any particular regulator\u2019s or enforcement authority\u2019s interpretation of a legal, accounting or reserving issue may change over time to our detriment, or expose us to different or additional regulatory risks. The application of these regulations and guidelines by insurers involves interpretations and judgments that may differ from those of state insurance departments. We cannot provide assurance that such differences of opinion will not result in regulatory, tax or other challenges to the actions we have taken to date. The result of those potential challenges could require us to increase levels of statutory capital and reserves or incur higher operating costs and/or have implications on certain tax positions.\nLitigation and regulatory investigations or other actions are common in the insurance business and may result in financial losses and harm our reputation.\nWe face the risk of litigation and regulatory investigations or other actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses, including class action lawsuits. Our pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings specific to us and others generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which we operate.\nIn our insurance operations, we are, have been, or may become subject to class actions and individual suits alleging, among other things, issues relating to sales or underwriting practices, increases to in-force\nlong-term care and life insurance premiums, payment of contingent or other sales commissions, claims payments and procedures, cancellation or rescission of coverage, product design, product disclosure, product administration, additional premium charges for premiums paid on a periodic basis, denial or delay of benefits, charging excessive or impermissible fees on products, recommending unsuitable products to customers, our pricing structures and business practices in our mortgage insurance subsidiaries, such as captive reinsurance arrangements with lenders and contract underwriting services, violations of RESPA or related state anti-inducement laws and breaching fiduciary or other duties to customers. In our investment-related operations, we are subject to litigation involving commercial disputes with counterparties. We may also have disputes with reinsurance partners relating to the parties\u2019 rights and obligations under reinsurance treaties and/or related administration agreements. In addition, we are also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as information requests, subpoenas, books and record examinations and market conduct and financial examinations, from state, federal and international regulators and other authorities. Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us, as well as regulators, may seek very large or indeterminate amounts, which may remain unknown for substantial periods of time.\nWe are also subject to litigation arising out of our general business activities such as our contractual and employment relationships and we are also subject to shareholder putative class action lawsuits alleging securities law violations.\nA substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action (including uncertainty about the outcome of pending legal and regulatory investigations and actions) against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, even if we ultimately prevail in the litigation, regulatory action or investigation, we could suffer significant reputational harm and incur significant legal expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. At this time, it is not feasible to predict, nor determine, the ultimate outcomes of any pending investigations and legal proceedings, nor to provide reasonable ranges of possible losses other than those that have been disclosed.\nFor a further discussion of certain current investigations and proceedings in which we are involved, see note 20 in \u201cPart II-Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d We cannot assure you that these investigations and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, business, financial\ncondition or results of operations. It is also possible that we could become subject to further investigations and have lawsuits filed or enforcement actions initiated against us. In addition, increased regulatory scrutiny and any resulting investigations or legal proceedings could result in new legal precedents and industry-wide regulations or practices that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn adverse change in our regulatory requirements, including risk-based capital, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur U.S. life insurance subsidiaries are subject to the NAIC\u2019s RBC standards and other minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements imposed under the laws of their respective states of domicile. The failure of our insurance subsidiaries to meet applicable RBC requirements or minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements could subject our insurance subsidiaries to further examination or corrective action imposed by state insurance regulators, including limitations on their ability to write additional business, or the addition of state regulatory supervision, rehabilitation, seizure or liquidation. As of December 31, 2021, the RBC of each of our U.S. life insurance subsidiaries exceeded the level of RBC that would require any of them to take or become subject to any corrective action in their respective domiciliary state. However, we continue to face challenges in our principal life insurance subsidiaries, particularly those subsidiaries that rely heavily on in-force\nrate actions as a source of earnings and capital. We may see variability in statutory results and a decline in the RBC ratios of these subsidiaries given the time lag between the approval of in-force\nrate actions versus when the benefits from the in-force\nrate actions (including increased premiums and associated benefit reductions) are fully realized in our financial results. Additionally, the RBC ratio of our U.S. life insurance subsidiaries would be negatively impacted by future increases in our statutory reserves, including results of Actuarial Guideline 38, cash flow testing and assumption reviews, particularly in our long-term care insurance business. Future declines in the RBC ratio of our life insurance subsidiaries could result in heightened supervision and regulatory action.\nEnact Holdings and its U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries are not subject to the NAIC\u2019s RBC requirements but are required by certain states and other regulators to maintain a certain risk-to-capital\nratio. In addition, PMIERs includes financial requirements for mortgage insurers under which a mortgage insurer\u2019s \u201cAvailable Assets\u201d (generally only the most liquid assets of an insurer) must meet or exceed \u201cMinimum Required Assets\u201d (which are based on an insurer\u2019s risk-in-force\nand are calculated from tables of factors with several risk dimensions and are subject to a floor amount). The failure of Enact Holdings and its U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries to meet their regulatory requirements, and additionally the PMIERs financial requirements, could limit their ability to write new business. For further discussion of the importance of financial requirements to Enact Holdings, see \u201c-If Enact Holdings is unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs because the GSEs amend them or the GSEs\u2019 interpretation of the financial requirements requires Enact Holdings to hold amounts of capital that are higher than planned or otherwise, Enact Holdings may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition\u201d and \u201c-Enact Holdings\u2019 U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum statutory capital requirements, which if not met or waived, would result in restrictions or prohibitions on them doing business and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d\nAn adverse change in our U.S. life insurance subsidiaries\u2019 RBC, risk-to-capital\nratio or other minimum regulatory requirements could cause rating agencies to downgrade the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and the credit ratings of Genworth Holdings, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to execute our strategic plan, including establishing a new long-term care insurance business, and would further restrict our ability to retain and write new business. Furthermore, it may cause regulators to take regulatory or supervisory actions with respect to our U.S. life insurance subsidiaries, thereby limiting the financial flexibility of our holding company, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nChanges to the role of the GSEs or to the charters or business practices of the GSEs, including actions or decisions to decrease or discontinue the use of mortgage insurance, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe requirements and practices of the GSEs impact the operating results and financial performance of approved mortgage insurers, including Enact Holdings. Changes in the charters or business practices of Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae could materially reduce the number of mortgages they purchase that are insured by Enact Holdings and consequently diminish the value of our business. The GSEs could be directed to make such changes by the FHFA, which was appointed as their conservator in September 2008 and has the authority to control and direct the operations of the GSEs.\nWith the GSEs in a prolonged conservatorship, there has been ongoing debate over the future role and purpose of the GSEs in the United States housing market. Congress may legislate, or the administration may implement through administrative reform, structural and other changes to the GSEs and the functioning of the secondary mortgage market. Since 2011, there have been numerous legislative proposals intended to incrementally scale back the GSEs (such as a statutory mandate for the GSEs to transfer mortgage credit risk to the private sector) or to completely reform the United States housing finance system. Congress, however, has not enacted any legislation to date. Recently, there has been increased focus on and discussion of administrative reform independent of legislative action. The proposals vary with regard to the government\u2019s role in the housing market, and more specifically, with regard to the existence of an explicit or implicit government guarantee. If any GSE reform is adopted, whether through legislation or administrative action, it could impact the current role of private mortgage insurance as a credit enhancement, including its reduction or elimination, which would have an adverse effect on our revenue, business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of these matters, it is uncertain what role private capital, including mortgage insurance, will play in the U.S. residential housing finance system in the future or the impact any such changes could have on our business. Any changes to the charters or statutory authorities of the GSEs would likely require Congressional action to implement. Passage and timing of any comprehensive GSE reform or incremental change (legislative or administrative) is uncertain, making the actual impact on Enact Holdings and the private mortgage insurance industry difficult to predict. Any such changes that come to pass could have a significant impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe FHFA and GSEs are focused on increasing the accessibility and affordability of homeownership, in particular for low-\nand moderate-income borrowers and underserved minority communities. Among other things, the FHFA directed the GSEs to submit equitable housing plans by the end of 2021 to identify and address barriers to sustainable housing opportunities, including the GSEs\u2019 goals and action plans to advance equity in housing finance for the next three years; lifted the 50 basis point adverse market fee applicable to most refinance loans; directed the GSEs to expand their streamlined refinance programs; and directed the GSEs to make desktop appraisals permanent by incorporating the practice into their selling guides, which originally was a temporary practice implemented in light of COVID-19.\nThese changes, along with any new practices or programs subsequently implemented under the GSEs\u2019 equitable housing plans or other affordability initiatives, may impact the fees, underwriting and servicing standards on mortgage loans purchased by the GSEs.\nThe FHFA has set goals for the GSEs to transfer significant portions of the GSE\u2019 mortgage credit risk to the private sector. This mandate builds upon the goal established by the GSEs to increase the role of private capital through experimenting with different forms of transactions and structures. Enact Holdings has participated in credit risk transfer programs developed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on a limited basis. In 2018, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae announced the launch of limited pilot programs, Integrated Mortgage Insurance (\u201cIMAGIN\u201d) and Enterprise Paid Mortgage Insurance (\u201cEPMI\u201d), respectively, as alternative ways for lenders to sell to the GSEs loans with loan-to-value\nratios greater than 80%. These investor-paid mortgage insurance programs, in which insurance is acquired directly by each GSE, have many of the same features and represent an alternative to traditional private mortgage insurance products that are provided to individual lenders. Participants in IMAGIN and EPMI are not subject to compliance with the current PMIERs, which may create a competitive disadvantage\nfor private mortgage insurers if these pilot programs are expanded. These programs were suspended in the third quarter of 2021, but to the extent these credit risk products evolve in a manner that displaces primary mortgage insurance coverage, the amount of insurance Enact Holdings writes may be reduced. It is difficult to predict the impact of alternative credit risk transfer products that are developed to meet the goals established by the FHFA. In addition, in December 2020, the FHFA published a final rule of its Enterprise Capital Framework. The Enterprise Capital Framework may impact the credit risk transfer programs developed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and/or the role of private mortgage insurance as credit enhancement by potentially accelerating the recent diversification of the GSE\u2019s risk transfer programs to encompass a broader array of instruments, beyond private mortgage insurance.\nFreddie Mac and Fannie Mae also possess substantial market power, which enables them to influence Enact Holdings and the mortgage insurance industry in general. Although Enact Holdings actively monitors and develops its relationship with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, a deterioration in any of these relationships, or the loss of business or opportunities for new business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf Enact Holdings is unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs because the GSEs amend them or the GSEs\u2019 interpretation of the financial requirements requires Enact Holdings to hold amounts of capital that are higher than planned or otherwise, Enact Holdings may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn furtherance of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s respective charter requirements, each GSE adopted PMIERs effective December 31, 2015. Amendments to PMIERs have occurred periodically since its inception. Most recently, in June 2021, the GSEs issued a revised and restated version of PMIERs that, among other things, extended the capital preservation requirements for mortgage insurers through December 31, 2021. The PMIERs include financial requirements for mortgage insurers under which a mortgage insurer\u2019s \u201cAvailable Assets\u201d (generally only the most liquid assets of an insurer) must meet or exceed \u201cMinimum Required Assets\u201d (which are based on an insurer\u2019s risk-in-force\nand are calculated from tables of factors with several risk dimensions and are subject to a floor amount) and otherwise generally establish when a mortgage insurer is qualified to issue coverage that will be acceptable to the respective GSE for acquisition of high loan-to-value\nmortgages. The GSEs may amend or waive PMIERs at their discretion, impose additional conditions or restrictions, and have broad discretion to interpret PMIERs, which could impact the calculation of available assets and/or minimum required assets or require an increase in assets held to remain compliant.\nThe amount of capital that may be required in the future to maintain the Minimum Required Assets, as defined in PMIERs, is dependent upon, among other things: (i) the way PMIERs are applied and interpreted by the GSEs and FHFA as and after they are implemented; (ii) the future performance of the U.S. housing market, including as a result of COVID-19\nand the length and speed of recovery; (iii) Enact Holdings\u2019 available assets and risk-based required assets, reducing risk in-force\nand reducing delinquencies as anticipated, and writing anticipated amounts and types of new mortgage insurance business; and (iv) Enact Holdings\u2019 ability to generate earnings and its overall financial performance, capital and liquidity levels. Depending on actual experience, the amount of capital required under PMIERs for Enact Holdings may be higher than currently anticipated. In the absence of a premium increase, if Enact Holdings holds more capital relative to its insured loans, its returns will be lower. Enact Holdings may be unable to increase premium rates for various reasons, principally due to competition. Enact Holdings inability to increase its capital as required under anticipated timeframes and on anticipated terms, and realize the anticipated benefits, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. More specifically, Enact Holdings\u2019 ability to continue to meet the PMIERs financial requirements and maintain a prudent amount of capital in excess of requirements, given the dynamic nature of asset valuations and requirement changes over time, is dependent upon, among other things: (i) Enact Holdings\u2019 ability to complete credit risk transfer transactions on our anticipated terms and timetable, which are subject to market conditions, third-party approvals and other actions (including approval by regulators and the GSEs), and other factors which are outside its control; and (ii) Enact Holdings\u2019 ability to contribute its\nholding company cash or other sources of capital to satisfy the portion of the financial requirements that are not satisfied through credit risk transfer transactions. In addition, another potential capital source includes, but is not limited to, the issuance of securities by Genworth Financial, Genworth Holdings or Enact Holdings, which could materially adversely impact our business, shareholders and debtholders.\nThe most recent PMIERs amendments included temporary capital preservation provisions effective through December 31, 2021, that required an approved insurer to obtain prior written GSE approval before paying any dividends, pledging or transferring assets to an affiliate or entering into any new, or altering any existing arrangements under tax sharing and intercompany expense-sharing agreements, even if such insurer had a surplus of available assets. These PMIERs amendments have restricted and may continue to restrict, to the extent the capital preservation provisions are further extended, the ability of Enact Holdings to pay dividends to us. See \u201c-Genworth Financial and Genworth Holdings depend on the ability of their respective subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments and distributions to each of them and to meet their obligations.\u201d It is unclear what, if any, further actions the GSEs may take in the event COVID-19\nfinancial hardships continue into 2022. Furthermore, if changes are made to the temporary provisions of the PMIERs amendments, including allowing loans that enter a forbearance plan due to a COVID-19\nhardship on or after April 1, 2021 to remain eligible for extended application of the reduced PMIERs capital factor for as long as the loan remains in forbearance, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn September 2020, the GSEs imposed certain conditions and restrictions on Enact Holdings with respect to its capital. See \u201cRegulation-Enact-Mortgage Insurance Regulation\u201d for additional details. These additional conditions and restrictions imposed by the GSEs could limit the operating flexibility of Enact Holdings, particularly in the areas in which new business is written and may adversely impact its competitive position, its ability to meet and maintain compliance with the PMIERs requirements and Genworth\u2019s overall business. Moreover, it further restricts the ability of Enact Holdings to pay dividends and requires the retention of higher capital levels limiting the availability of capital to be utilized elsewhere in the business.\nEnact Holdings\u2019 assessment of PMIERs compliance is based on a number of factors, including affiliate asset valuations under PMIERs and its understanding of the GSEs\u2019 interpretation of the PMIERs financial requirements. Although we believe Enact Holdings has sufficient capital as required under PMIERs and it remains an approved insurer, there can be no assurance these conditions will continue. In addition, there can be no assurance Enact Holdings will continue to meet the conditions contained in the GSE letters granting PMIERs credit for reinsurance and other credit risk transfer transactions including, but not limited to, its ability to remain below a statutory risk-to-capital\nratio of 18:1. The GSEs also reserve the right to reevaluate the credit for reinsurance and other credit risk transfer transactions available under PMIERs. If Enact Holdings is unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs, the GSE restrictions discussed above or any additional restrictions imposed by the GSEs, whether because the GSEs amend them or the GSE\u2019s interpretation of the financial requirements requires Enact Holdings to hold amounts of capital that are higher than planned or otherwise, Enact Holdings may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, compliance with PMIERs requires Enact Holdings to seek the GSEs\u2019 prior approval before taking many actions, including implementing certain new products or services or entering into inter-company agreements among others. PMIERs\u2019 prior approval requirements could prohibit, materially modify or delay our intended course of action. Further, the GSEs may modify or change their interpretation of terms they require Enact Holdings to include in their mortgage insurance coverage for loans purchased by the GSEs, requiring Enact Holdings to modify its terms of coverage or operational procedures to remain an approved insurer, and such changes could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and operating results. It is possible the GSEs could, at their own discretion, require additional limitations and/or conditions on certain of Enact Holdings\u2019 activities and practices that are not currently in the PMIERs in order for Enact Holdings to remain an approved insurer. Additional requirements or conditions imposed by the GSEs could limit Enact Holdings\u2019 operating flexibility and the areas in which it may write new business. Any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEnact Holdings\u2019 U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum statutory capital requirements, which if not met or waived, would result in restrictions or prohibitions on them doing business and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain states have insurance laws or regulations which require a mortgage insurer to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to its level of risk in-force.\nWhile formulations of minimum capital vary in certain states, the most common measure applied allows for a maximum permitted risk-to-capital\nratio of 25:1. If one of Enact Holdings\u2019 U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries that is writing business in a particular state fails to maintain that state\u2019s required minimum capital level, it would generally be required to immediately stop writing new business in the state until the insurer re-establishes\nthe required level of capital or receives a waiver of the requirement from the state\u2019s insurance regulator, or until it establishes an alternative source of underwriting capacity acceptable to the regulator. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, GMICO\u2019s risk-to-capital\nratio was approximately 12.3:1. If GMICO exceeds required risk-to-capital\nlevels in the future, Enact Holdings and Genworth Financial would seek required regulatory and GSE forbearance and approvals or seek approval for the utilization of alternative insurance vehicles. However, there can be no assurance if, and on what terms, such forbearance and approvals may be obtained.\nThe NAIC established the MGIWG to determine and make recommendations to the NAIC\u2019s Financial Condition Committee as to what, if any, changes to make to the solvency and other regulations relating to mortgage guaranty insurers. The MGIWG continues to work on revisions to the MGI Model, revisions to Statement of Statutory Accounting Principles No. 58-Mortgage Guaranty Insurance and the development of a mortgage guaranty supplemental filing. More specifically, the MGIWG is working on the development of the mortgage guaranty insurance capital model, which is needed to determine the RBC and loan-level capital standards for the amended MGI Model. The proposed amendments of the MGI Model are expected to be finalized by the MGIWG in the spring of 2022. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of this process, whether any state will adopt the amended MGI Model or any of its specific provisions, the effect changes, if any, will have on the mortgage guaranty insurance market generally, or on our business specifically, the additional costs associated with compliance with any such changes, or any changes to our operations that may be necessary to comply, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We also cannot predict whether other regulatory initiatives will be adopted or what impact, if any, such initiatives, if adopted as laws, may have on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in regulations that adversely affect the mortgage insurance markets in which Enact Holdings operates could affect its operations significantly and could reduce the demand for mortgage insurance.\nIn addition to the general regulatory risks that are described under \u201c-Our insurance businesses are extensively regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth,\u201d we are also affected, through our ownership of Enact Holdings, by various additional regulations related specifically to mortgage insurance operations.\nFederal and state regulations affect the scope of competitor operations, which influences the size of the mortgage insurance market and the intensity of the competition. This competition includes not only other private mortgage insurers, but also U.S. federal and state governmental and quasi-governmental agencies, principally the FHA and the VA, which are governed by federal regulations. Increases in the maximum loan amount that the FHA can insure, and reductions in the mortgage insurance premiums the FHA charges, can reduce the demand for private mortgage insurance. Decreases in the maximum loan amounts or maximum loan-to-value\nratio of loans the GSEs will purchase or guarantee or increases in GSE fees can also reduce demand for private mortgage insurance. Legislative, regulatory or administrative changes could cause demand for private mortgage insurance to decrease. In addition, there is uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the Basel framework and whether its rules will be implemented in the United States. It is possible that its implementation could occur in the United States and its rules could discourage the use of mortgage insurance. See \u201c-Basel Framework\u201d below for further details.\nIn December 2020, the FHFA published a final rule of its Enterprise Capital Framework, which imposes a new capital framework on the GSEs, including risk-based and leverage capital requirements and capital buffers in excess of regulatory minimums that can be drawn down in periods of financial distress. The Enterprise Capital Framework became effective on February 16, 2021. However, the GSEs will not be subject to any requirement under the Enterprise Capital Framework until (i) the date of termination of the conservatorship of a GSE and (ii) any later compliance date provided in a consent order or other transition order applicable to such GSE. The Enterprise Capital Framework significantly increases capital requirements and reduces capital credit on credit risk transfer transactions as compared to the previous framework. The final rule could cause the GSEs to increase their guarantee pricing in order to meet the new capital requirements. If the GSEs increase their guarantee pricing in order to meet the higher capital requirements, that increase could have a negative impact on Enact Holdings, the overall private mortgage insurance market and our business. Furthermore, higher GSE capital requirements could ultimately lead to increased costs to borrowers for GSE loans, which in turn could shift the market away from the GSEs to the FHA or lender portfolios. Such a shift could result in a smaller market size for private mortgage insurance. This rule could also accelerate the recent diversification of the GSE\u2019s risk transfer programs to encompass a broader array of instruments beyond private mortgage insurance, which could adversely impact Enact Holdings and our business. Likewise, legislation or regulation that changes the role of the GSEs, ends the GSEs\u2019 conservatorship or increases the number of people eligible for FHA or VA mortgages could have a material adverse effect on Enact Holdings and limit its ability to compete with the FHA or VA thereby adversely impacting our business.\nEnact Holdings and its U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries, as credit enhancement providers in the residential mortgage lending industry, are also subject to compliance with various federal and state consumer protection and insurance laws, including RESPA, the ECOA, the FHA, the Dodd-Frank Act (including the adoption of the QM Rule), HOPA, the FCRA and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, among others. These laws prohibit payments for referrals of settlement service business, providing services to lenders for no or reduced fees or payments for services not actually performed, require fairness and non-discrimination\nin granting or facilitating the granting of credit, require cancellation of insurance and refund of unearned premiums under certain circumstances, govern the circumstances under which companies may obtain and use consumer credit information, and define the manner in which companies may pursue collection activities. Changes in these laws or regulations, changes in the appropriate regulator\u2019s interpretation of these laws or regulations or heightened enforcement activity could materially adversely affect the operations and profitability of Enact Holdings.\nBasel Framework\nIn December 2017, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (\u201cBasel Committee\u201d) published the finalization of the post-crisis reforms to the Basel framework that are generally targeted for implementation by each participating country by January 1, 2023. Under these revisions to the international framework, banks using the standardized approach to determine their credit risk may consider mortgage insurance in calculating the exposure amount for real estate but will determine the risk-weight for residential mortgages based on the loan-to-value\nratio at loan origination, without consideration of mortgage insurance. Under the standardized approach, after the appropriate risk-weight is determined, the existence of mortgage insurance could be considered, but only if the company issuing the insurance has a lower risk-weight than the underlying exposure. Mortgage insurance issued by private companies would not meet this test. Therefore, under the Basel framework, mortgage insurance could not mitigate credit and lower the capital charge under the standardized approach. It is possible that the Federal Banking Agencies could determine that their current capital rules are as stringent as the Basel framework, in which case no change would be mandated. However, if the Federal Banking Agencies decide to implement the Basel framework as specifically drafted by the Basel Committee, mortgage insurance would not lower the loan-to-value\nratio of residential loans for capital purposes and therefore may decrease the demand for mortgage insurance. Because these reforms are not yet implemented by national supervisors or the Federal Banking Agencies, we cannot predict the mortgage insurance benefits or disadvantages, if any, that ultimately will be provided to lenders. If the Federal Banking Agencies implement the Basel framework in a manner that does not reward lenders for using mortgage insurance on high loan-to-value\nmortgage loans, or if\nlenders conclude that mortgage insurance does not provide sufficient capital incentives, Enact Holdings and our business and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nOur U.S. life insurance subsidiaries may not be able to continue to mitigate the impact of Regulations XXX or AXXX and, therefore, they may incur higher operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have increased term and universal life insurance statutory reserves in response to Regulations XXX and AXXX and have taken steps to mitigate the impact these regulations have had on our business, including increasing premium rates and implementing reserve funding structures. One way that we and other insurance companies have mitigated the impact of these regulations is through captive reinsurance companies and/or special purpose vehicles. If we were to discontinue our use of captive life reinsurance subsidiaries to finance statutory reserves in response to regulatory changes on a prospective basis, the reasonably likely impact would be increased costs related to alternative financing, such as third-party reinsurance, which would adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we cannot be certain that affordable alternative financing would be available.\nOn March 7, 2016, we suspended sales of our traditional life insurance products. While we are no longer writing new life insurance business, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to continue to implement actions to mitigate the impacts of Regulations XXX or AXXX on our in-force\nterm and universal life insurance products which are not currently part of reserve funding structures or which may be part of existing reserve arrangements and need refinancing.\nAdditionally, there may be future regulatory, tax or other impacts to existing reserve funding structures and/or future refinancing, which could require us to increase statutory reserves or incur higher operating and/or tax costs. For example, effective January 1, 2017, the NAIC adopted an amended version of AG 48, which was subsequently codified in the Term and Universal Life Insurance Reserve Financing Model Regulation. This regulation becomes effective when formally adopted by the states; however, it is not clear what additional changes or state variations may emerge as the states continue to adopt this regulation. As a result, there is the potential for additional requirements making it more difficult and/or expensive for us to mitigate the impact of Regulations XXX and AXXX. To date, eight states have implemented the Term and Universal Life Insurance Reserve Financing Model Regulation, including Virginia, which is the state regulator for GLAIC, one of our principal life insurance subsidiaries. In the coming months, additional states are expected to adopt the model regulation because it will become an NAIC accreditation standard effective September 1, 2022, with enforcement to begin January 1, 2023.\nChanges in accounting and reporting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies and insurance regulators could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. GAAP, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board. It is possible that future accounting and reporting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the required adoption of future accounting and reporting standards may result in significant costs to implement. For example, new accounting guidance (that is not yet effective for us) related to long-duration insurance contracts will likely materially impact our financial position and significantly reduce our equity upon adoption, including our equity at the accounting transition date of January 1, 2021, and could result in increased volatility in our results of operations, as well as other comprehensive income (loss). In addition, the implementation of this new accounting guidance or other proposals\ncould require us to make significant changes to systems and use additional resources, resulting in significant incremental costs. See note 2 in \u201cPart II-Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional details.\nOperational Risks\nIf we are unable to retain, attract and motivate qualified employees or senior management, our results of operations, financial condition and business operations may be adversely impacted.\nOur success is largely dependent on our ability to retain, attract and motivate qualified employees and senior management. We face intense competition in our industry for key employees with demonstrated ability, including actuarial, finance, legal, investment, risk, compliance and other professionals. Our ability to retain, attract and motivate experienced and qualified employees and senior management has been more challenging in light of our financial difficulties, announcements concerning expense reductions and from the demands being placed on our employees, as well as recruitment challenges due to the current labor shortage and low labor participation rate. In addition, our ability to attract, recruit, retain and motivate current and prospective employees may have been, or may in the future be, adversely impacted due to uncertainty and/or the company changing its strategic direction. Furthermore, as the future of work evolves and work arrangements, such as a remote work environment become more flexible and commonplace, our ability to compete for qualified employees could be further challenged. A remote work environment could expand competition among employers and may put us at a disadvantage if we are unable or unwilling to implement certain of these policies. We cannot be sure we will be able to attract, retain and motivate the desired workforce, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on results of operations, financial condition and business operations. In addition, we may not be able to meet regulatory requirements relating to required expertise in various professional positions.\nManaging key employee succession and retention is also critical to our success. We would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior management and other key employees. While we have succession plans and long-term compensation plans, including retention programs, designed to retain our employees, our succession plans may not operate effectively and our compensation plans cannot guarantee that the services of these employees will continue to be available to us.\nEnact Holdings\u2019 reliance on key customers or distribution relationships could cause a loss of significant sales if one or more of those relationships terminate or are reduced.\nOur businesses depend on our relationships with our customers, and in particular, our relationships with our largest lending customers in Enact Holdings. Customers place private mortgage insurance provided by Enact Holdings directly on loans that they originate, and they purchase loans that already have mortgage insurance coverage provided by Enact Holdings. Customer relationships may influence the amount of business written with Enact Holdings and the customer\u2019s willingness to continue to approve Enact Holdings as a mortgage insurance provider for loans that they purchase. For example, Enact Holdings\u2019 largest customer accounted for 14% of its total new insurance written in 2021 and its top five customers generated 28% of its new insurance written in 2021. An inability to maintain a relationship with one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on the amount of new business Enact Holdings is able to write and consequently, our financial condition and results of operations. Enact Holdings ability to maintain business relationships and business volumes with its largest lending customers remains critical to the success of our business.\nWe cannot be certain that any loss of business from significant customers, or any single lender, would be replaced by other customers, existing or new. As a result of current market conditions and increased regulatory requirements, Enact Holdings\u2019 lending customers may decide to write business only with a limited number of mortgage insurers or only with certain mortgage insurers, based on their views of the insurer\u2019s pricing, service levels, underwriting guidelines, loss mitigation practices, financial strength, ratings or other factors.\nEnact Holdings distributes its products through a wide variety of distribution methods, including through relationships with key distribution partners (including lender customers). These distribution partners are an\nintegral part to Enact Holdings\u2019 business model. We are at risk that key distribution partners may merge, change their distribution model affecting how Enact Holdings\u2019 products are sold, or terminate their distribution contracts or relationships with them. In addition, timing of key distributor adoption of Enact Holdings\u2019 new product offerings may impact sales of its products. Some distributors have, and in the future others may, elect to terminate or reduce their distribution relationships with Enact Holdings or our U.S. life insurance subsidiaries for a variety of reasons, such as the result of Genworth\u2019s past financial challenges (including adverse ratings actions). Likewise, in the future, other distributors may terminate or reduce their relationships with Enact Holdings or our U.S. life insurance subsidiaries as a result of, among other things, Genworth\u2019s past financial challenges re-emerging,\nincluding future adverse developments in its business, adverse rating agency actions and concerns about market-related risks, or due to commission levels or the breadth of product offerings.\nEnact Holdings competes with government-owned and government-sponsored enterprises, and this may put them at a competitive disadvantage on pricing and other terms and conditions.\nEnact Holdings competes with the FHA and the VA, as well as certain local- and state-level housing finance agencies. Separately, the government-owned and government-sponsored enterprises, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, compete with Enact Holdings through certain of their risk-sharing insurance programs. Those competitors may establish pricing terms and business practices that may be influenced by motives such as advancing social housing policy or stabilizing the mortgage lending industry, which may not be consistent with maximizing return on capital or other profitability measures. In addition, those governmental enterprises typically do not have the same capital requirements that Enact Holdings and other mortgage insurance companies have and therefore may have financial flexibility in their pricing and capacity that could put Enact Holdings at a competitive disadvantage. In the event that a government-owned or sponsored entity decides to change prices significantly or alter the terms and conditions of its mortgage insurance or other credit enhancement products in furtherance of social or other goals rather than a profit or risk management motive, Enact Holdings may be unable to compete effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely impacted from deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting.\nThe design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While management continually reviews the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, such as those we have reported in the past, or any other failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures could result in material errors or restatements in our historical financial statements or untimely filings, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, that would result in a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nOur computer systems may fail or be compromised, and unanticipated problems could materially adversely impact our disaster recovery systems and business continuity plans, which could damage our reputation, impair our ability to conduct business effectively, result in enforcement action or litigation, and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the effective operation of our computer systems. We also have arrangements in place with our partners and other third-party service providers through which we share and receive information. We rely on these systems throughout our business for a variety of functions, including processing claims and applications, providing information to customers and distributors, performing actuarial analyses and maintaining financial records. Despite the implementation of security and back-up\nmeasures, our computer systems and those of our partners and third-party service providers have been, and may be in the future,\nvulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions, computer viruses or other attacks, system failures, programming errors, employee and third-party errors or wrongdoing, and similar disruptive problems. The failure of these systems for any reason could cause significant interruptions to our operations, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTechnology continues to expand and plays an ever increasing role in our business. While it is our goal to safeguard information assets from physical theft and cybersecurity threats, there can be no assurance that our information security will detect and protect information assets from these ever increasing risks. Information assets include both information itself in the form of computer data, written materials, knowledge and supporting processes, and the information technology systems, networks, other electronic devices and storage media used to store, process, retrieve and transmit that information. As more information is used and shared by our employees, customers and suppliers, both within and outside our company, cybersecurity threats become expansive in nature. Confidentiality, integrity and availability of information are essential to maintaining our reputation, legal position and ability to conduct our operations. Although we have implemented controls and continue to train our employees, a cybersecurity event could still occur which would cause damage to our reputation with our customers, distributors and other stakeholders and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe retain confidential information in our computer systems, and we rely on commercial technologies to maintain the security of those systems, including computers or mobile devices. Anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures and penetrate our computer systems or misuse authorized access could access, view, misappropriate, alter, or delete any information in the systems, including personally identifiable information, personal health information and proprietary business information. Our employees, distribution partners and other vendors use portable computers or mobile devices which may contain similar information to that in our computer systems, and these devices have been and can be lost, stolen or damaged, and therefore subject to the same risks as our other computer systems. In addition, an increasing number of states and foreign countries require that affected parties be notified or other actions be taken (which could involve significant costs to us) if a security breach results in the inappropriate disclosure of personally identifiable information. We have experienced occasional, actual or attempted breaches of our cybersecurity, although to date none of these breaches has had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation. Any compromise of the security of our computer systems or those of our partners and third-party service providers that results in inappropriate disclosure of personally identifiable customer information could damage our reputation in the marketplace, deter people from purchasing our products, subject us to significant civil and criminal liability and require us to incur significant technical, legal and other expenses.\nThe area of cybersecurity and data privacy have come under increased scrutiny in recent years, with various countries, government agencies and insurance regulators introducing and/or passing legislation in an attempt to safeguard personal information from the escalating cybersecurity treats. For additional details, see \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Other Laws and Regulations-Cybersecurity\u201d and \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Other Laws and Regulations-Privacy of Consumer Information.\u201d We have implemented internal policies, practices and controls designed to comply with applicable data privacy and security laws. Failure to comply with these laws may result in enforcement action, litigation, monetary fines, or other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and reputation.\nIn addition, unanticipated problems with, or failures of, our disaster recovery systems and business continuity plans could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly if those problems affect our information technology systems and destroy, lose or otherwise compromise valuable data. Furthermore, in the event that a significant number of our employees were unavailable in the event of a disaster or a pandemic, our ability to effectively conduct business could be severely compromised. The failure of our disaster recovery systems and business continuity plans could adversely impact our profitability and our business.\nInsurance and Product-Related Risks\nEnact Holdings may be unable to maintain or increase capital in its mortgage insurance subsidiaries in a timely manner, on anticipated terms or at all, including through improved business performance, reinsurance or similar transactions, asset sales, securities offerings or otherwise, in each case as and when required.\nEnact Holdings intends to continue to support its increased capital needs to promote its growth, maximize its value and to meet its regulatory capital requirements, including as a result of PMIERs. Our ability to support the capital needs of Enact Holdings are limited. See \u201c-We may be unable to successfully execute our strategic plans to strengthen our financial position and create long-term shareholder value.\u201d Accordingly, we are largely reliant on Enact Holdings to support its own capital needs. Furthermore, our current plans do not include any additional minority sales resulting in Genworth owning less than 80% of Enact Holdings, accordingly, Enact Holdings ability to raise additional capital by issuing its stock to third parties is limited. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, Enact Holdings met the PMIERs financial and operational requirements. In order to continue to provide a prudent level of financial flexibility in connection with the PMIERs capital requirements given the dynamic nature of asset valuations, requirement changes over time and recent conditions and restrictions imposed by the GSEs, Enact Holdings may be required to execute future financing transactions, including additional credit risk transfer transactions and contributions of its holding company cash. See \u201c-If Enact Holdings is unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs because the GSEs amend them or the GSEs\u2019 interpretation of the financial requirements requires Enact Holdings to hold amounts of capital that are higher than planned or otherwise, Enact Holdings may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nThe implementation of any further credit risk transfer transactions depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to, market conditions, third-party approvals or other actions (including approval by regulators and the GSEs), and other factors which are outside Enact Holdings\u2019 control, and therefore we cannot be sure Enact Holdings will be able to successfully implement these actions on the anticipated timetable and terms, or at all. Even if Enact Holdings is able to successfully implement these actions, there is no assurance they will be able to achieve the anticipated benefits from the actions.\nOur financial condition, results of operations, long-term care insurance products and/or our reputation in the market may be adversely affected if our U.S. life insurance subsidiaries are unable to implement premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions on in-force\nlong-term care insurance policies by enough or quickly enough.\nThe continued viability of our long-term care insurance business, as well as that of GLIC and GLICNY, is based on our ability to obtain significant premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions on our in-force\nlong-term care insurance products. The adequacy of our current long-term care insurance reserves also depends significantly on our assumptions regarding our ability to successfully execute our in-force\nrate action plan through premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions. We include assumptions for future in-force\nrate actions, which includes assumptions for significant premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions that have been approved or are anticipated to be approved (including premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions not yet filed), in our determination of loss recognition testing of our long-term care insurance reserves under U.S. GAAP and asset adequacy testing of our statutory long-term care insurance reserves. In 2021, our long-term care insurance block, excluding our acquired block, includes an assumption for future in-force\nrate actions (anticipated to be approved, including premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions not yet filed) of approximately $9.0 billion in its loss recognition testing.\nAlthough the terms of our long-term care insurance policies permit us to increase premiums under certain circumstances during the premium-paying period, these increases generally require regulatory approval, which\ncan often take a long time to obtain and may not be obtained in all relevant jurisdictions or for the full amounts requested. In addition, some states have adopted, or are considering adopting long-term care insurance rate increase legislation that would further limit increases in long-term care insurance premium rates beyond the statutes and regulations previously adopted in certain states, which would adversely impact our ability to achieve anticipated rate increases. Furthermore, some states have refused to approve actuarially justified rate actions.\nWe will not be able to realize our future premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions in the future if we cannot obtain the required regulatory approvals. In this event, we would have to increase our long-term care insurance reserves by amounts that would likely be material and would result in a material adverse impact. Moreover, we may not be able to sufficiently mitigate the impact of unexpected adverse experience through premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions. Given the claims history in our long-term care insurance business and its related pressure to reserve levels and earnings, and the expectation that claims will continue to rise due to the aging of the block and higher incidence and severity, among other factors, absent future premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions, our results of operations, capital levels, RBC and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. In addition, if the timing of our future premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions takes longer to achieve than originally assumed, we would likely record higher reserves with no offsetting premiums and associated benefit reductions from in-force\nrate actions to mitigate the negative impact, which would likely result in an operating loss for our long-term care insurance business.\nPolicyholders may be unwilling or unable to pay the increased premium rates we seek to charge. We cannot predict how our policyholders and regulators may react to any in-force\nrate increases, nor can we predict if regulators will approve requested in-force\nrate increases. In certain circumstances, our policyholders have brought legal action against us due to alleged misleading and inadequate disclosures regarding premium rate increases, see \u201c-Litigation and regulatory investigations or other actions are common in the insurance business and may result in financial losses and harm our reputation\u201d and note 20 in our consolidated financial statements under \u201cItem 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information.\nReinsurance may not be available, affordable or adequate to protect us against losses.\nAs part of our overall risk and capital management strategy, we purchase reinsurance from external reinsurers, use credit risk transfer transactions and provide internal reinsurance support for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments. These reinsurance arrangements and credit risk transfer transactions are intended to enable our businesses to transfer risks in exchange for some of the associated economic benefits and, as a result, improve our statutory capital position, manage risk to within our tolerance level and improve the PMIERs position of Enact Holdings. The availability and cost of reinsurance protection are impacted by our operating and financial performance, including ratings, as well as conditions beyond our control. For example, our insurance subsidiaries low financial strength ratings may reduce the availability of certain types of reinsurance and make it more costly when it is available, as reinsurers are less willing to take on credit risk in a volatile market. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain new reinsurance or renew existing reinsurance arrangements on acceptable terms, or at all, which could increase our risk and adversely affect our ability to obtain statutory capital credit for new reinsurance or could require us to make capital contributions to maintain regulatory capital requirements. Likewise, our U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries have incurred higher expenses associated with credit risk transfer transactions during 2020 and 2021 for a variety of reasons, including COVID-19\nand may be unable to obtain new transactions on acceptable terms or at all in the future. Absent the availability and affordability to enter into new credit risk transfer transactions, the ability of Enact Holdings to obtain PMIERs or statutory credit for new transactions would be adversely impacted. See \u201c-If Enact Holdings is unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs because the GSEs amend them or the GSEs\u2019 interpretation of the financial requirements requires Enact Holdings to hold amounts of capital that are higher than planned or otherwise, Enact Holdings may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nWe also manage risk and capital allocated to our long-term care insurance business through utilization of external reinsurance in the form of coinsurance. We executed external reinsurance agreements to reinsure 20% of\nall sales of our individual long-term care insurance products that have been introduced since early 2013. External new business reinsurance is dependent on a number of factors, including price, availability, risk tolerance and capital levels. Our U.S. life insurance subsidiaries have also executed external reinsurance agreements to reinsure sales of some of their older blocks of long-term care insurance products (10% of new business issued from 2003 to 2008; 20% to 30% of new business issued from 2009 to 2011; and 40% of new business issued from 2011 to early 2013). We also have external reinsurance on some older blocks of business which includes a treaty on a yearly renewable term basis on business that was written between 1998 and 2003. This yearly renewable term reinsurance provides coverage for claims on those policies for 15 years after the policy was written. After 15 years, reinsurance coverage ends for policies not on claim, while reinsurance coverage continues for policies on claim until the claim ends. The 15-year\ncoverage on the policies written in 2003 expired in 2018; therefore, any new claims will not have reinsurance coverage under this treaty. Since 2013, we have seen, and may continue to see, an increase in our benefit costs as policies with reinsurance coverage exhaust their benefits or terminate and policies which are not covered by reinsurance go on claim. Over time, there can be no assurance that affordable, or any, reinsurance will continue to be available.\nA decrease in the volume of high loan-to-value\nhome mortgage originations or an increase in the volume of mortgage insurance cancellations could result in a decline in Enact Holdings\u2019 revenue.\nEnact Holdings provides mortgage insurance primarily for high loan-to-value\nmortgages. Factors that could lead to a decrease in the volume of high loan-to-value\nmortgage originations include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nan increase in the level of home mortgage interest rates and a reduction or loss of mortgage interest deductibility for federal income tax purposes;\n\u2022\nimplementation of more rigorous mortgage lending regulation;\n\u2022\na decline in economic conditions generally, or in conditions in regional and local economies;\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer confidence, which may be adversely affected by economic instability, war or terrorist events;\n\u2022\nan increase in the price of homes relative to income levels;\n\u2022\nadverse population trends, including lower homeownership rates;\n\u2022\nhigh rates of home price appreciation, which for refinancings affect whether refinanced loans have loan-to-value\nratios that require mortgage insurance; and\n\u2022\nchanges in government housing policy encouraging loans to first-time home buyers.\nA decline in the volume of high loan-to-value\nmortgage originations would reduce the demand for mortgage insurance and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on Enact Holdings and our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, each year, Enact Holdings recognizes a significant percentage of its earned premiums from renewal premiums on insurance policies written in previous years. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we estimate that approximately 84% of Enact Holdings\u2019 gross earned premiums were renewal premiums compared to approximately 85% and 88% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a result, the length of time insurance remains in-force\nis an important determinant of Genworth\u2019s mortgage insurance revenues. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and many other mortgage investors generally permit a homeowner to ask the loan servicer to cancel the borrower\u2019s obligation to pay for mortgage insurance when the principal amount of the mortgage falls below 80% of the home\u2019s value. Factors that tend to reduce the length of time our mortgage insurance remains in-force\ninclude:\n\u2022\ndeclining interest rates, which may result in the refinancing of the mortgages underlying the insurance policies with new mortgage loans that may not require mortgage insurance or that Enact Holdings does not insure;\n\u2022\nsignificant appreciation in the value of homes, which causes the size of the mortgage to decrease below 80% of the value of the home and enables the borrower to request cancellation of the mortgage insurance; and\n\u2022\nchanges in mortgage insurance cancellation requirements or procedures under applicable federal law or mortgage insurance cancellation practices by mortgage lenders and investors.\nAny change in the methodology by which servicers determine the cancellation dates of mortgage insurance under HOPA; GSE requirements or otherwise, including as a result of changes in law or regulation; GSE rules or guidance, including changes in response to COVID-19\nor homeowner affordability initiatives; and/or for any other reason, could reduce the amount of Enact Holdings\u2019 insurance in-force\nand may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEnact Holdings\u2019 primary persistency rates were 62%, 59% and 76% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A decrease in persistency generally would reduce the amount of Enact Holdings\u2019 insurance in-force\nand could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Conversely, higher persistency on certain products, especially A minus, Alt-A,\nARMs and certain 100% loan-to-value\nloans, could have a material adverse effect if claims generated by such products remain elevated or increase.\nThe amount of mortgage insurance written by Enact Holdings could decline significantly if alternatives to private mortgage insurance are used or lower coverage levels of mortgage insurance are selected.\nThere are a variety of alternatives to private mortgage insurance that may reduce the amount of mortgage insurance written by Enact Holdings. These alternatives include:\n\u2022\noriginating mortgages that consist of two simultaneous loans, known as \u201csimultaneous seconds,\u201d comprising a first mortgage with a loan-to-value\nratio of 80% and a simultaneous second mortgage for the excess portion of the loan, instead of a single mortgage with a loan-to-value\nratio of more than 80%;\n\u2022\nusing government mortgage insurance programs;\n\u2022\nholding mortgages in the lenders\u2019 own loan portfolios and self-insuring;\n\u2022\nusing programs, such as those offered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the United States, requiring lower mortgage insurance coverage levels;\n\u2022\noriginating and securitizing loans in mortgage-backed securities whose underlying mortgages are not insured with private mortgage insurance or which are structured so that the risk of default lies with the investor, rather than a private mortgage insurer; and\n\u2022\nusing risk-sharing insurance programs, credit default swaps or similar instruments, instead of private mortgage insurance, to transfer credit risk on mortgages.\nThe degree to which lenders or borrowers may select these alternatives now, or in the future, is difficult to predict. As one or more of the alternatives described above, or new alternatives that enter the market, are chosen over private mortgage insurance, Enact Holdings\u2019 revenue could be adversely impacted. The loss of business in general or the specific loss of more profitable business in Enact Holdings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nEnact Holdings is exposed to potential liabilities in connection with its U.S. contract underwriting services which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnact Holdings offers contract underwriting services to certain of its mortgage lenders, pursuant to which its employees and contractors work directly with the lender to determine whether the data relating to a borrower and a\nproposed loan contained in a mortgage loan application file complies with the lender\u2019s loan underwriting guidelines or the investor\u2019s loan purchase requirements. In connection with that service, Enact Holdings also compiles the application data and submits it to the automated underwriting systems of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which independently analyze the data to determine if the proposed loan complies with their investor requirements.\nUnder contract underwriting agreement terms, Enact Holdings agrees to indemnify the lender against losses incurred in the event material errors are made by its contract underwriters in determining whether loans meet specified underwriting or purchase criteria, subject to contractual limitations. As a result, Enact Holdings assumes credit and processing risk in connection with its contract underwriting services. If Enact Holdings\u2019 reserves for potential claims in connection with its contract underwriting services are inadequate as a result of differences between its estimates and assumptions or other reasons, Enact Holdings may be required to increase its underlying reserves, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nEnact Holdings\u2019 delegated underwriting program may subject its mortgage insurance subsidiaries to unanticipated claims.\nCertain of Enact Holdings\u2019 customers commit to insure loans that use Enact Holdings pre-established\nguidelines under delegated underwriting authority. Delegated underwriting represents approximately 66% of Enact Holdings total new insurance written by loan count for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Once a customer is accepted into Enact Holdings delegated underwriting program, a loan originated by that customer is generally insured without validating the accuracy of the data submitted, investigated for fraud or reviewed to ensure the customer followed the pre-established\nguidelines for delegated underwriting. Under this program, it is possible a customer could insure a material number of loans that would fail Enact Holdings pre-established\nguidelines for delegated underwriting but pass its model, among other criteria, before Enact Holdings discovers the problem and terminates the customer\u2019s delegated underwriting authority. Although coverage on such loans may be rescindable or otherwise limited under the terms of Enact Holdings\u2019 master policies, the burden of establishing the right to rescind or deny coverage lies with the insurer. To the extent that Enact Holdings\u2019 customers exceed their delegated underwriting authorities, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nMedical advances, such as genetic research and diagnostic imaging, and related legislation could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our life insurance, long-term care insurance and annuity businesses.\nGenetic testing research and discovery is advancing at a rapid pace. Though some of this research is focused on identifying the genes associated with rare diseases, much of the research is focused on identifying the genes associated with an increased risk of various diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Diagnostic testing utilizing various blood panels or imaging techniques, including the use of artificial intelligence, may allow clinicians to detect similar diseases during an earlier treatment phase and prescribe more acute medicine or treatments. We believe that if an individual learns through such testing that they are predisposed to a condition that may reduce their life expectancy or increase their chances of requiring long-term care, they potentially will be more likely to purchase life and long-term care insurance policies or avoid lapsing their existing policy. In contrast, if an individual learns that they lack the genetic predisposition to develop the conditions that reduce longevity or require long-term care, they potentially will be less likely to purchase life and long-term care insurance products or allow their life and long-term care insurance policies to lapse, but would be more likely to purchase certain annuity products.\nBeing able to access and use the medical information (including the results of genetic and diagnostic testing) known to our prospective policyholders is important to ensure that an underwriting risk assessment matches the anticipated risk priced into our life and long-term care insurance products, as well as our annuity products. Currently, there are some state level restrictions related to an insurer\u2019s access and use of genetic information, and periodically new genetic testing legislation is being introduced. However, further restrictions on the access and use of such medical information could create a mismatch between an assessed risk and the product pricing. Such\na mismatch has the potential to increase product pricing causing a decrease in sales to lower risk individuals resulting in higher risk individuals becoming the more likely buyer. In addition, it is possible that regulators may enforce anti-discrimination provisions even when medical information is available that indicates a purchaser is at higher risk. The net result of this could cause a deterioration in the risk profile of our portfolio which could lead to payments to our policyholders and contractholders that are materially higher than anticipated. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition to earlier diagnosis or knowledge of disease risk, medical advances may also lead to newer forms of preventive care which could improve an individual\u2019s overall health and/or longevity. If this were to occur, the duration of payments made by us under certain forms of life insurance policies or annuity contracts would likely increase thereby reducing our profitability on those products. Conversely, slower progressing medical advances, particularly in the areas of cognitive decline, could adversely impact our long-term care insurance business as policyholders may remain on claim for a long period of time resulting in higher severity and duration of claims.\nOther General Risk\nThe occurrence of natural or man-made\ndisasters or a public health emergency, including pandemics, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and tornadoes, many of which could be exacerbated by climate change. The risk of a public health emergency, including from a pandemic, exposes us to risks similar to those experienced during COVID-19.\nFor example, a future pandemic, similar to COVID-19,\ncould disrupt our computer systems and our ability to conduct or process business, as well as lead to unexpected changes in mortgage borrower, policyholder and contractholder behavior. We are also exposed to the continued threat of terrorism, military actions and other man-made\ndisasters, which may cause significant volatility in global financial markets and could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas, as well as an adverse effect on home prices in those areas, which could result in increased loss experience in our mortgage insurance subsidiaries. Disasters or a public health emergency, including a pandemic, could also disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which could disrupt our normal business operations.", "PERMNO": 90162, "SIC": 6311, "TIC": "GNW"}
