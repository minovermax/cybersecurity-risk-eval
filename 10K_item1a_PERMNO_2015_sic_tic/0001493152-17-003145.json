{"cik": "849636", "company": "RespireRx Pharmaceuticals Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our continuing operations and the price of our common stock are subject to the following risks:\nRisks related to our business\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIn its audit opinion issued in connection with our balance sheets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and our statements of operations, stockholders\u2019 equity (deficiency), and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern given our limited working capital, recurring net losses and negative cash flows from operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in existence. While we have relied principally in the past on external financing to provide liquidity and capital resources for our operations, we can provide no assurance that cash generated from our operations together with cash received in the future from external financing, if any, will be sufficient to enable us to continue as a going concern.\nWe have a history of net losses; we expect to continue to incur net losses and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nSince our formation on February 10, 1987 through the end of our most recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, we have generated only modest operating revenues. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, our net loss was $9,229,760 and as of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $157,510,779. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our net loss was $5,961,892 and as of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $148,279,854. We have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and it is possible that we will never generate revenues from product sales in the future. Even if we do achieve significant revenues from product sales, we expect to incur significant net losses over the next several years. As with other companies in the biotechnology industry, it is possible that we will never achieve profitable operations.\nWe will need additional capital in the near term and the future and, if such capital is not available on terms acceptable to us or available to us at all, we may need to scale back our research and development efforts and may be unable to continue our business operations.\nWe will require substantial additional funds to advance our research and development programs and to continue our operations, particularly if we decide to independently conduct later-stage clinical testing and apply for regulatory approval of any of our proposed products, and if we decide to independently undertake the marketing and promotion of our products. Additionally, we may require additional funds in the event that we decide to pursue strategic acquisitions of or licenses for other products or businesses. Based on our operating plan as of December 31, 2016, we estimated that our existing cash resources will not be sufficient to meet our requirements for 2017. We believe that we will require additional capital in the near term to fund on-going operations including basic operations. Additional funds may come from the sale of common equity, preferred equity, convertible preferred equity or equity-linked securities, debt, including debt convertible into equity, or may result from agreements with larger pharmaceutical companies that include the license or rights to the technologies and products that we are currently developing, although there is no assurance that we will secure any such transaction in a timely manner, or at all.\nOur cash requirements in the future may differ significantly from our current estimates, depending on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf the results of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf the costs of setting up and operating our own marketing and sales organization;\n\u25cf the ability to obtain funding under contractual and licensing agreements;\n\u25cf the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents or any litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property;\n\u25cf the costs involved in meeting our contractual obligations including employment agreements; and\n\u25cf our success in entering into collaborative relationships with other parties.\nTo finance our future activities, we may seek funds through additional rounds of financing, including private or public equity or debt offerings and collaborative arrangements with corporate partners. We may also seek to exchange or restructure some of our outstanding securities to provide liquidity, strengthen our balance sheet and provide flexibility. We cannot say with any certainty that these measures will be successful, or that we will be able to obtain the additional needed funds on reasonable terms, or at all. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional and possibly substantial dilution to our stockholders. If we issued preferred equity or debt securities, these securities could have rights superior to holders of our common stock, and such instruments entered into in connection with the issuance of securities could contain covenants that will restrict our operations. We might have to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies, product candidates or products that we otherwise would not relinquish. In 2012, several members of management departed. In March 2013 the then-current remaining members of management were removed by our newly elected board of directors and new officers were appointed. If adequate funds are not available in the future, as required, we could lose our key employees and might have to further delay, scale back or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs, which would impair our future prospects. In addition, we may be unable to meet our research spending obligations under our existing licensing agreements and may be unable to continue our business operations.\nOur product opportunities rely on licenses from research institutions and if we lose access to these technologies or applications, our business could be substantially impaired.\nUnder our agreements with The Regents of the University of California, we had exclusive rights to certain ampakine compounds for all applications for which the University had patent rights, other than endocrine modulation. The license securing these rights has since been terminated.\nUnder a patent license agreement with The Governors of the University of Alberta, we have exclusive rights to the use of certain ampakine compounds to prevent and treat respiratory depression induced by opioid analgesics, barbiturates and anesthetic and sedative agents.\nOn May 8, 2007, the Company entered into a license agreement, as subsequently amended, with the University of Alberta granting the Company exclusive rights to practice patents held by the University of Alberta claiming the use of ampakines for the treatment of various respiratory disorders. The Company agreed to pay the University of Alberta a licensing fee and a patent issuance fee, which were paid, and prospective payments consisting of a royalty on net sales, sublicense fee payments, maintenance payments and milestone payments. The prospective maintenance payments commence on the enrollment of the first patient into the first Phase 2B clinical trial and increase upon the successful completion of the Phase 2B clinical trial. As the Company does not at this time anticipate scheduling a Phase 2B clinical trial in the near term, no maintenance payments are currently due and payable nor are expected to be due in the near future, to the University of Alberta in connection with the license agreement.\nThrough the merger with Pier, the Company gained access to an Exclusive License Agreement (as amended, the Old License), that Pier had entered into with the University of Illinois on October 10, 2007. The Old License Agreement covered certain patents and patent applications in the United States and other countries claiming the use of certain compounds referred to as cannabinoids for the treatment of sleep related breathing disorders (including sleep apnea), of which dronabinol is a specific example of one type of cannabinoid. Dronabinol is a synthetic derivative of the naturally occurring substance in the cannabis plant, otherwise known as \u03949-THC (\u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol). Dronabinol is currently approved by the FDA and is sold generically for use in refractory chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, as well as for anorexia in patients with AIDS. Pier\u2019s business plan was to determine whether dronabinol would significantly improve subjective and objective clinical measures in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. In addition, Pier intended to evaluate the feasibility and comparative efficacy of a proprietary formulation of dronabinol. The Old License Agreement was terminated effective March 21, 2013 due to the Company\u2019s failure to make a required payment and on June 27, 2014, the Company entered into the 2014 License Agreement with the University of Illinois that was similar, but not identical, to the Old License Agreement that had been terminated. If we are unable to comply with the terms of the 2014 License Agreement, such as required payments thereunder, the 2014 License Agreement might be terminated.\nWe are at an early stage of development and we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize our products and technologies.\nThe development of ampakine products and cannabinoid products is subject to the risks of failure commonly experienced in the development of products based upon innovative technologies and the expense and difficulty of obtaining approvals from regulatory agencies. Drug discovery and development is time consuming, expensive and unpredictable. On average, only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine. All of our proposed products are in the preclinical or early clinical stage of development and will require significant additional funding for research, development and clinical testing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all, before we are able to submit them to any of the regulatory agencies for clearances for commercial use.\nThe process from discovery to development to regulatory approval can take several years and drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process. Late stage clinical trials often fail to replicate results achieved in earlier studies. Historically, in our industry more than half of all compounds in development failed during Phase 2 trials and 30% failed during Phase 3 trials. We cannot assure you that we will be able to complete successfully any of our research and development activities including those described above under PART I. Item 1. Business-Development Goals. Even if we do complete them, we may not be able to market successfully any of the products or be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or assure that healthcare providers and payors will accept our products. We also face the risk that any or all of our products will not work as intended or that they will be unsafe, or that, even if they do work and are safe, that our products will be uneconomical to manufacture and market on a large scale. Due to the extended testing and regulatory review process required before we can obtain marketing clearance, we do not expect to be able to commercialize any therapeutic drug for several years, either directly or through our corporate partners or licensees.\nWe may not be able to enter into the strategic alliances necessary to fully develop and commercialize our products and technologies, and we will be dependent on our strategic partners if we do.\nWe are seeking pharmaceutical company partners to develop other major indications for the ampakine compounds and cannabinoids. These agreements would potentially provide us with additional funds in exchange for exclusive or non-exclusive license or other rights to the technologies and products that we are currently developing. Competition between biopharmaceutical companies for these types of arrangements is intense. We cannot give any assurance that our discussions with candidate companies will result in an agreement or agreements in a timely manner, or at all. Additionally, we cannot assure you that any resulting agreement will generate sufficient revenues to offset our operating expenses and longer-term funding requirements.\nIf our third-party manufacturers\u2019 facilities do not follow current good manufacturing practices, our product development and commercialization efforts may be harmed.\nThere are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under the FDA\u2019s and European Union\u2019s good manufacturing practices regulations and are capable of manufacturing products like those we are developing. Third-party manufacturers may encounter difficulties in achieving quality control and quality assurance and may experience shortages of qualified personnel. A failure of third-party manufacturers to follow current good manufacturing practices or other regulatory requirements and to document their adherence to such practices may lead to significant delays in the availability of products for commercial use or clinical study, the termination of, or hold on, a clinical study, or may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products. In addition, we could be subject to sanctions, including fines, injunctions and civil penalties. Changing manufacturers may require additional clinical trials and the revalidation of the manufacturing process and procedures in accordance with FDA mandated current good manufacturing practices and would require FDA approval. This revalidation may be costly and time consuming. If we are unable to arrange for third-party manufacturing of our products, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to complete development or marketing of our products.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards will be subject to limitations upon a change in ownership, which could reduce our ability to use those loss carry forwards following any change in Company ownership.\nGenerally, a change of more than 50% in the ownership of a Company\u2019s stock, by value, over a three-year period constitutes an ownership change for U.S. federal income tax purposes. An ownership change may limit our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards attributable to the period prior to such change. We have sold or otherwise issued shares of our common stock in various transactions sufficient to constitute an ownership change, including the issuance of the Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock (as defined below), and the issuance of convertible notes and warrants, as well as the issuance of additional shares of our Common Stock and warrants. As a result, if we earn net taxable income in the future, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carry forwards, which amounted to approximately $89,930,000 as of December 31, 2016, to offset U.S. federal taxable income will be subject to limitations, which would restrict our ability to reduce future tax liability. Future shifts in our ownership, including transactions in which we may engage, may cause additional ownership changes, which could have the effect of imposing additional limitations on our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carry forwards.\nRisks related to our industry\nIf we fail to secure adequate intellectual property protection, it could significantly harm our financial results and ability to compete.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and processes in the United States and elsewhere. We have filed and intend to continue to file patent applications as we need them. However, additional patents that may issue from any of these applications may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Also, any patents issued to us or licensed by us may be designed around or challenged by others, and if such design or challenge is effective, it may diminish our rights and negatively affect our financial results.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient protection of our proprietary rights in our products or processes prior to or after obtaining regulatory clearances, our competitors may be able to obtain regulatory clearance and market similar or competing products by demonstrating at a minimum the equivalency of their products to our products. If they are successful at demonstrating at least the equivalency between the products, our competitors would not have to conduct the same lengthy clinical tests that we have or will have conducted.\nWe also rely on trade secrets and confidential information that we protect by entering into confidentiality agreements with other parties. Those confidentiality agreements could be breached, and our remedies may be insufficient to protect the confidential information. Further, our competitors may independently learn our trade secrets or develop similar or superior technologies. To the extent that our consultants, key employees or others apply technological information independently developed by them or by others to our projects, disputes may arise regarding the proprietary rights to such information or developments. We cannot assure you that such disputes will be resolved in our favor.\nWe may be subject to potential product liability claims. One or more successful claims brought against us could materially affect our business and financial condition.\nThe clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing of our products may expose us to product liability claims. We have never been subject to a product liability claim, and we require each patient in our clinical trials to sign an informed consent agreement that describes the risks related to the trials, but we cannot assure you that the coverage limits of our insurance policies will be adequate or that one or more successful claims brought against us would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and result of operations. Further, if one of our ampakine or cannabinoid compounds is approved by the FDA for marketing, we cannot assure you that adequate product liability insurance will be available, or if available, that it will be available at a reasonable cost. Any adverse outcome resulting from a product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition, and our competitors may develop products that are superior to those we are developing.\nOur business is characterized by intensive research efforts. Our competitors include many companies, research institutes and universities that are working in a number of pharmaceutical or biotechnology disciplines to develop therapeutic products similar to those we are currently investigating. Most of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and/or other resources than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have experience in performing human clinical trials of new or improved therapeutic products and obtaining approvals from the FDA and other regulatory agencies. We have no experience in conducting and managing later-stage clinical testing or in preparing applications necessary to obtain regulatory approvals. Accordingly, it is possible that our competitors may succeed in developing products that are safer or more effective than those that we are developing and/or may obtain FDA approvals for their products faster than we can. We expect that competition in this field will continue to intensify.\nWe may be unable to recruit and retain our senior management and other key technical personnel on whom we are dependent.\nWe are highly dependent upon senior management and key technical personnel and currently do not carry any insurance policies on such persons. Since our change in management in March 2013, we are highly dependent on Arnold S. Lippa, Ph.D., our Chief Scientific Officer and Executive Chairman (and formerly our President and Chief Executive Officer), Jeff E. Margolis, our Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary. In addition, in 2014 we appointed John Greer, Ph.D. as the Chairman of our Science Advisory Board and hired Richard Purcell as our Senior Vice President of Research and development, and in 2015, we hired James S. J. Manuso, Ph.D. to succeed Dr. Lippa as the Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer and to be Vice Chairman. Competition for qualified employees among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies is intense. The loss of any of our senior management or other key employees, or our inability to attract, retain and motivate the additional or replacement highly-skilled employees and consultants that our business requires, could substantially hurt our business prospects. Additionally, in February 2017, Robert N. Weingarten resigned as our Chief Financial Officer and member of our Board of Directors, although he remains a consultant to the Company. On a temporary basis, Jeff E. Margolis has been appointed Interim Chief Financial Officer. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain a qualified long-term replacement for Mr. Weingarten.\nThe regulatory approval process is expensive, time consuming, uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining required approvals for the commercialization of some of our products.\nThe FDA and other similar agencies in foreign countries have substantial requirements for therapeutic products. Such requirements often involve lengthy and detailed laboratory, clinical and post-clinical testing procedures and are expensive to complete. It often takes companies many years to satisfy these requirements, depending on the complexity and novelty of the product. The review process is also extensive, which may delay the approval process even more.\nAs of yet, we have not obtained any approvals to market our products. Further, we cannot assure you that the FDA or other regulatory agency will grant us approval for any of our products on a timely basis, if at all. Even if regulatory clearances are obtained, a marketed product is subject to continual review, and later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on marketing or withdrawal of the product from the market.\nRisks related to capital structure\nOur stock price may be volatile and our common stock could decline in value.\nThe market price of securities of life sciences companies in general has been very unpredictable. The range of sales prices of our common stock for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, as quoted on the OTC QB, was $1.50 to $12.34 and $3.25 to $19.83, respectively as adjusted for our 325-to-1 reverse stock split, effective September 1, 2016. The following factors, in addition to factors that affect that market generally, could significantly affect our business, and the market price of our common stock could decline:\n\u25cf competitors announcing technological innovations or new commercial products;\n\u25cf competitors\u2019 publicity regarding actual or potential products under development;\n\u25cf regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u25cf developments concerning proprietary rights, including patent litigation;\n\u25cf public concern over the safety of therapeutic products; and\n\u25cf changes in healthcare reimbursement policies and healthcare regulations.\nOur common stock is thinly traded and you may be unable to sell some or all of your shares at the price you would like, or at all, and sales of large blocks of shares may depress the price of our common stock.\nOur common stock has historically been sporadically or \u201cthinly-traded,\u201d meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing shares of our common stock at prevailing prices at any given time may be relatively small or nonexistent. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in shares of our common stock is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer that has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. This could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. You may be unable to sell your common stock at or above your purchase price, which may result in substantial losses to you. Also, as a consequence of this lack of liquidity, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our stockholders may disproportionately influence the price of shares of our common stock in either direction. The price of shares of our common stock could, for example, decline precipitously in the event a large number of share of our common shares are sold on the market without commensurate demand, as compared to a seasoned issuer which could better absorb those sales without adverse impact on its share price.\nThere is a large number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock that may be issued or sold, and if such shares are issued or sold, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had 2,149,045 shares of our common stock outstanding.\nIf all warrants and options outstanding as of December 31, 2016 are exercised prior to their expiration, up to 1,847,987 additional shares of our common stock could become freely tradable. The issuance of such shares would dilute the interests of the current stockholders and sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could also make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock.\nOn March 18 and April 17, 2014, we issued shares of our Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock, which are convertible into shares of our common stock (see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015). On November 5, December 9 and December 31, 2014, and again on February 2, 2015 we issued convertible notes and warrants, that are convertible and exercisable respectively, into shares of our common stock (see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015). We may in the future issue additional equity or equity-based securities. All of our Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock had converted to common stock by April 17, 2016, and some of our convertible notes and related warrants have converted into or been exercised for common stock, and any unexercised warrants associated with our unconverted convertible notes have expired. As of December 31, 2016, however, there were remaining outstanding convertible notes totaling $338,616 of principal and accrued interest that may convert into 29,804 shares of common stock. If we issue additional equity or equity-based securities, the number of shares of our common stock outstanding could increase substantially, which could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could also make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, as a result of the December 29, 2016 and December 30, 2016 issuances of equity and warrants with exchange rights into subsequent financings, such exchange rights, if exercised, may have a dilutive effect which may increase substantially, which could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could also make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock.\nOur charter document may prevent or delay an attempt by our stockholders to replace or remove management.\nCertain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our business, even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, allows the Board of Directors of the Company, referred to as the Board or Board of Directors, to issue, as of December 31, 2016, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with characteristics to be determined by the board, without stockholder approval. The ability of our Board of Directors to issue additional preferred stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing an attempt by our stockholders to replace or remove existing directors and management.\nIf our common stock is determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock in the secondary market.\nIn addition, our common stock may be subject to the so-called \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) has adopted regulations that define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange. For any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d unless exempt, the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. If our common stock is determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock on the secondary market.", "PERMNO": 75962, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "RSPI"}
