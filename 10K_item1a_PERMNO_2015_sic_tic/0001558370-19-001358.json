{"cik": "1573166", "company": "Jones Energy, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following risks, or any risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, were actually to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our shares could decline resulting in the loss of part or all of your investment. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect us.\nRisks Relating to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Our Business:\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition. Our annual interest expense is large relative to our cash flow.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $1.0 billion of total long-term debt obligations. Our indebtedness may significantly affect our financial flexibility in the future, including by making it more difficult for us to borrow in the future, making us more vulnerable to adverse economic or industry conditions and deterring third parties from material transactions with us. Our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay our indebtedness. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, we may be required to sell assets, to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or to obtain additional financing.\nFor more information on our indebtedness, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nWe have concluded that we need to restructure our balance sheet to continue as a going concern, and we can provide no assurances of the terms of any such restructuring transaction in which we may engage or how any such transaction will impact our security-holders.\nAs a result of extremely challenging current market conditions and our significant indebtedness, we believe we will require a significant restructuring of our balance sheet within the next twelve months in order to continue as a going concern in the near term. We have based this belief on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be wrong, and we could spend our available financial resources less or more rapidly than currently expected. We have previously entered into confidentiality agreements and commenced discussions with legal and financial advisors for certain creditors to explore one or more possible restructuring, financing, refinancing, reorganization, recapitalization, amendment, waiver, forbearance, asset sale and/or similar transactions involving the Company. We have not yet reached agreement on mutually acceptable terms and conditions with our creditors regarding a possible transaction. Our current circumstances raise substantial doubt as to the ability of the company to continue to realize the carrying value of our assets and operate as a going concern.\nThere can be no assurance that our efforts will result in any agreement or what the terms of any agreement will be. If an agreement is reached and we pursue a restructuring, it may be necessary for us to file a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in order to implement the agreement through the confirmation and consummation of a plan of reorganization approved by the bankruptcy court in the bankruptcy proceedings. We also may conclude that it is necessary to initiate Chapter 11 proceedings to implement a restructuring of our obligations even if we are unable to reach an agreement with our creditors and other relevant parties regarding the terms of such a restructuring. In either case, such a proceeding could be commenced in the near term. If a plan of reorganization is implemented in a bankruptcy proceeding, it is possible that holders of claims and interests with respect to, or rights to acquire, our equity securities would be entitled to little or no recovery, and those claims and interests may be canceled for little or no consideration. If that were to occur, we anticipate that all or substantially all of the value of all investments in our equity securities would be lost and that our equity holders would lose all or substantially all of their investment. It is also possible that our other stakeholders, including our secured and unsecured creditors, will receive substantially less than the amount of their claims.\nOur potential for restructuring transactions may impact our business, financial condition and operations.\nDue to the potential for a restructuring of our balance sheet, there is risk that, among other things\n\u00b7\nthird parties lose confidence in our ability to continue to operate in the ordinary course, which could impact our ability to execute on our business strategy;\n\u00b7\nit may become more difficult to attract, retain or replace key employees;\n\u00b7\nemployees could be distracted from performance of their duties;\n\u00b7\nwe could lose some or a significant portion of our liquidity, either due to stricter credit terms from vendors, or, in the event we undertake a Chapter 11 proceeding and conclude that we need to procure debtor-in-possession financing, an inability to obtain any needed debtor-in-possession financing or to provide adequate protection to certain secured lenders to permit us to access some or all of our cash; and\n\u00b7\nour vendors, hedge counterparties, and service providers could seek to renegotiate the terms of our arrangements, terminate their relationship with us or require financial assurances from us.\nWe have significant capital needs, and our ability to access the capital and credit markets to raise capital on favorable terms is limited by our debt level and industry conditions.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets, in particular with respect to the energy sector, could limit our ability to access these markets or may significantly increase our cost to borrow. Low commodity prices have caused and may continue to cause lenders to increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt around maturity on favorable terms or at all and may reduce or cease to provide funding to borrowers. If we are unable to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and our ability to repay or refinance our debt.\nA substantial or extended decline in oil, natural gas or NGL prices would adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.\nThe price we receive for our oil, natural gas and NGLs heavily influences our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Oil and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. During the past eight years, the NYMEX WTI oil price has ranged from a low of $26.19 per Bbl in February 2016 to a high of $113.39 per Bbl in April 2011, and was $56.92 as of February 20, 2019. The NYMEX Henry Hub spot market price of gas has ranged from a high of $8.15 per MMBtu in February 2014 to a low of $1.49 in March 2016, and was $2.64 as of February 20, 2019. These markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future, especially given the current geopolitical conditions. The prices we receive for our production and the levels of our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include the following:\n\u00b7\nregional and worldwide economic conditions impacting the supply and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u00b7\nthe actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, including whether it meets the reduced output targets it has previously announced or may announce in the future;\n\u00b7\nthe level of production in non-OPEC countries;\n\u00b7\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u00b7\npolitical conditions regionally, domestically or in other oil and gas-producing regions;\n\u00b7\nthe level of domestic and global oil and natural gas exploration and production;\n\u00b7\nthe level of domestic and global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u00b7\nlocalized supply and demand fundamentals and available pipeline and other oil and gas transportation capacity;\n\u00b7\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u00b7\ndomestic, local and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u00b7\nactivities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and gas so as to reduce the potential for harm to the environment from such activities, including emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas;\n\u00b7\nspeculation as to the future price of oil, natural gas and NGLs and the speculative trading of oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u00b7\ntrading prices of futures contracts;\n\u00b7\nprice and availability of competitors\u2019 supplies of oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u00b7\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u00b7\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u00b7\nthe impact of energy conservation efforts.\nNGLs are made up of ethane, propane, isobutane, butane and natural gasoline, all of which have different uses and different pricing characteristics. NGLs comprised 30% of our 2018 production, and we realized an average price of $24.38 per barrel, a 15.6% increase from the average realized price of our 2017 production. An extended decline in NGL prices could materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSubstantially all of our production is sold to purchasers under contracts with market-based prices. Lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices will reduce our cash flows and the present value of our reserves. Additionally, prices could reduce our cash flows to a level that would require us to borrow to fund our planned capital budget. Lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices may also reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can develop and produce economically. Substantial decreases in oil, natural gas and NGL prices could render uneconomic a significant portion of our identified drilling locations. This may result in significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves. As a result, a substantial or extended decline in oil, natural gas or NGL prices may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures.\nDrilling for and producing oil, natural gas and NGLs are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our exploration, exploitation, development and production activities. Our oil, natural gas and NGLs exploitation, development and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil and natural gas production. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit locations or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of information obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. We cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from other wells, more fully explored prospectus or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling prospects. In addition, our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences, which ultimately results in uncertainty as to when the capital investment required to deploy rigs will create an acceptable return for our shareholders. Further, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel our scheduled drilling projects, including the following:\n\u00b7\ndelays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory and contractual requirements and related lawsuits, which may include limitations on hydraulic fracturing or the discharge of greenhouse gases;\n\u00b7\npressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u00b7\nshortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel;\n\u00b7\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u00b7\nlack of available gathering facilities or delays in construction of gathering facilities;\n\u00b7\nlack of available capacity on interconnecting transmission pipelines;\n\u00b7\nfires and blowouts;\n\u00b7\nadverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes, blizzards and ice storms;\n\u00b7\nenvironmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials, and unauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases or other pollutants into the surface or subsurface environment;\n\u00b7\ndeclines in oil, natural gas and NGL prices;\n\u00b7\nlimited availability of financing at acceptable rates;\n\u00b7\ntitle problems; and\n\u00b7\nlimitations in the market for oil, natural gas and NGLs.\nPart of our strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques, which involve risks and uncertainties in their application.\nOur operations involve utilizing some of the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers. Risks that we face while drilling include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\neffectively controlling the level of pressure flowing from particular wells;\n\u00b7\nlanding our wellbore in the desired drilling zone;\n\u00b7\nstaying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation;\n\u00b7\nrunning our casing the entire length of the wellbore; and\n\u00b7\nrunning tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore.\nRisks that we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nthe ability to effectively fracture stimulate the planned number of stages;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations; and\n\u00b7\nthe ability to successfully clean out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage.\nThe results of our drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. Newer or emerging formations and areas have limited or no production history and, consequently, we are more limited in assessing future drilling results in these areas.\nThe value of our undeveloped acreage could decline if drilling results are unsuccessful.\nThe success of our horizontal drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, access to gathering systems, declines in oil, natural gas and NGL prices and/or other factors, the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate. Further, as a result of any of these developments we could incur material write-downs of our oil and gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nOur business requires substantial capital expenditures, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all.\nOur exploration, exploitation, development and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. Our 2018 capital expenditures totaled $192.6 million (excluding the impact of asset retirement costs, asset disposals and non-cash impairments of oil and gas properties), of which $149.5 million was utilized to drill and complete operated wells. The Company has established an initial capital budget of $60.0 million for 2019. Historically, we have funded development and operating activities primarily through a combination of equity capital raised from a private equity partner and public equity offerings, through borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolver\u201d), through the issuance of debt securities and through internal operating cash flows. We intend to finance the majority of our capital expenditures predominantly with cash flows from operations. If necessary, we may also access capital through proceeds from potential asset dispositions, cash on hand, and the issuance of additional debt and equity securities. Our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u00b7\nthe estimated quantities of our oil, natural gas and NGL reserves;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce from existing wells;\n\u00b7\nthe prices at which we sell our production;\n\u00b7\nany gains or losses from our hedging activities;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of developing and producing our oil, natural gas and NGL reserves;\n\u00b7\ntake-away capacity;\n\u00b7\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;\n\u00b7\nthe ability and willingness of banks and other lenders to lend to us; and\n\u00b7\nour ability to access the equity and debt capital markets.\nIf our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund our capital expenditure budget, we may have limited ability to obtain the additional capital necessary to conduct our operations at expected levels. The indentures governing our senior notes due 2022, or the 2022 Notes, and senior notes due 2023, or the 2023 Notes, and the 2023 First Lien Notes restrict our ability to obtain new debt financing. We may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. The failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to exploration and development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a decline in our oil, natural gas and NGLs production or reserves, and in some areas a loss of properties.\nExternal financing may be required in the future to fund our growth. We may not be able to obtain additional financing, and financing through the capital markets may not be available in the future. Without additional capital resources, we may be unable to pursue and consummate acquisition opportunities as they become available, and we may be forced to limit or defer our planned oil, natural gas and NGLs development program, which will adversely affect the recoverability and ultimate value of our oil, natural gas and NGLs properties, in turn negatively affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur transition to the OTCQX from the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) may impact our trading volume and liquidity, lower prices of our Class A common stock and make more difficult for us to raise capital.\nOn November 26, 2018, the Company notified the NYSE of its intention to voluntarily delist its Class A common stock from the NYSE. Since November 27, 2018, our Class A common stock has been trading on the OTCQX under the symbol \u201cJONE.\u201d If an adequate trading market for our Class A common stock does not develop on the OTCQX, it could negatively impact us by (i) reducing the liquidity and market price of our Class A common stock; (ii) reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our Class A common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing; (iii) limiting our ability to use a registration statement to offer and sell freely tradeable securities, thereby preventing us from accessing the public capital markets; and (iv) impairing our ability to provide equity incentives to our employees.\nThe development of our proved undeveloped reserves in our areas of operation may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced by us. In addition, there are no assurances that our proved undeveloped reserves will be converted into producing reserves by us.\nApproximately 10% of our total estimated proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped as of December 31, 2018. Development of these reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. In addition, declines in commodity prices could cause us to reevaluate our development plans and delay or cancel development. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves or sustained periods of low commodity prices will reduce the future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, delays in the development of reserves or lower commodity prices could cause us to have to reclassify our proved reserves as unproved reserves. There is no certainty that we will be able to convert unproved reserves to developed reserves.\nOur identified drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled over many years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling, which in certain instances could prevent or delay associated expected production. In addition, we may not be able to raise the amount of capital that would be necessary to drill a substantial portion of our identified drilling locations.\nOur management team has identified and scheduled certain drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from a location that is ready to drill to a location that will require substantial additional interpretation. There is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular location will yield oil, natural gas or NGLs in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. Similarly, the use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area of producing wells will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable. Even if sufficient quantities of oil or natural gas exist, we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well, resulting in a reduction in production or abandonment of the well. If we drill additional wells that we identify as dry holes in our current and future drilling locations, our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business. In addition, our ability to drill and develop these drilling locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including oil, natural gas and NGL prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, the availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, gathering systems, marketing and pipeline transportation constraints, regulatory approvals and other factors. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors, we do not know if the numerous drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil, natural gas or NGLs from these or any other drilling locations.\nOur liquidity position has resulted in impairment of certain of our properties. Future declines in commodity prices, increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance may result in additional write-downs of the carrying amounts of our assets, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods.\nAccounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our properties for possible impairment. Based on prevailing commodity prices and specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our properties. A write-down constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. Such impairment may be accompanied by a reduction in proved reserves, thereby increasing future depletion charges per unit of production.\nPrimarily due to our liquidity position, we recorded non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges of $261.0 million and $1,060.0 million to our proved oil and gas properties in the Eastern Anadarko Basin and Western Anadarko Basin, respectively and a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $11.0 million to our unproved oil and gas properties in the Western Anadarko Basin. Future declines in natural gas, NGLs or oil prices, increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance, among other things, may result in our having to make significant additional future downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and/or could result in additional non-cash impairment charges to write-down the carrying amount of our assets, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods. Any impairment of our assets would require us to take an immediate charge to earnings. Such charges\ncould be material to our results of operations and could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cImpairment of Oil and Gas Properties\u201d in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nOur use of 2D and 3D seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of drilling hazards, including faults, or hydrocarbons, which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations.\nEven when properly used and interpreted, 2D and 3D seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons or drilling hazards such as faults are, in fact, present in those structures. In addition, the use of 3D seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and we could incur greater drilling and testing expenses as a result of such expenditures, which may result in a reduction in our returns or losses. As a result, our drilling activities may not be successful or economical, and our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activities in a particular area could decline.\nWe often gather 3D seismic data over large areas. Our interpretation of seismic data delineates those portions of an area that we believe are desirable for drilling. Therefore, we may choose not to acquire option or lease rights prior to acquiring seismic data, and, in many cases, we may identify hydrocarbon indicators before seeking option or lease rights in the location. Conversely, we may incur substantial expenditures to acquire and analyze 3D seismic data but not be able to lease attractive locations on acceptable terms.\nOur hedging strategy may be ineffective in reducing the impact of commodity price volatility from our cash flows or may limit our ability to realize cash flows from commodity price increases, which could result in financial losses or could reduce our income.\nTo achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs, we have historically entered into commodity derivative contracts for a significant portion of our oil, natural gas and NGL production that could result in both realized and unrealized hedging losses. The extent of our commodity price exposure is related largely to the effectiveness and scope of our commodity derivative contracts. For example, some of the commodity derivative contracts we utilize are based on quoted market prices, which may differ significantly from the actual prices we realize in our operations for oil, natural gas and NGLs. For the years ending December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, approximately 38%, 67%, and 100%, respectively, of our estimated total oil, natural gas and NGL production from proved reserves, based on our reserve report as of December 31, 2018, will not be covered by commodity derivative contracts.\nOur policy has been to hedge a significant portion of our estimated oil, natural gas and NGLs production. However, our price hedging strategy and future hedging transactions will be determined at our discretion. We are not under an obligation to hedge a specific portion of our production. The prices at which we hedge our production in the future will be dependent upon commodity prices at the time we enter into these transactions, which may be substantially higher or lower than current oil, natural gas and NGLs prices. Accordingly, our price hedging strategy may not protect us from significant declines in oil, natural gas and NGL prices received for our future production. Conversely, our hedging strategy may limit our ability to realize cash flows from commodity price increases. For example, the estimated mark-to-market value of our commodity price hedges in 2019 and beyond represents a liability of $8.2 million, incorporating strip pricing as of February 20, 2019 but excluding adjustments for credit risk.\nIn addition, our actual future production may be significantly higher or lower than we estimate at the time we enter into commodity derivative contracts for such period. If the actual amount is higher than we estimate, we will have greater commodity price exposure than we projected. If the actual amount is lower than the notional amount of our commodity derivative contracts, we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our commodity derivative contracts without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale or purchase of the underlying physical commodity, substantially diminishing our liquidity. There may be a change in the expected differential between the underlying commodity price in the commodity derivative contract and the actual price received, which may result in payments to our derivative counterparty that are not offset by our receipt of payments for our production in the field.\nAs a result of these factors, our commodity derivative activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the volatility of our cash flows, and in certain circumstances may actually increase the volatility of our cash flows.\nOur hedging transactions expose us to counterparty credit risk.\nOur hedging transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract. Disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden changes in a counterparty\u2019s liquidity, which could impair their ability to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We are unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty\u2019s creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions. Currently our entire hedge portfolio is hedged directly with banks in our credit agreements, thus allowing hedging without any margin requirements.\nDuring periods of falling commodity prices, our hedge receivable positions generally increase, which increases our counterparty credit exposure. If the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, we could incur a significant loss.\nDerivatives legislation and implementing rules could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivatives to reduce the effect of commodity price risk, interest rate risk and other risks associated with our business.\nWe use commodity derivatives to manage our commodity price risk. The U.S. Congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that, among other things, expands comprehensive federal oversight and regulation of derivatives and many of the entities that participate in that market. Although the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted on July 21, 2010, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or the CFTC, and the SEC, along with certain other regulators, must promulgate final rules and regulations to implement many of its provisions relating to derivatives. While some of these rules have been finalized, some have not. When fully implemented, the law and any new regulations could increase the operational and transactional cost of derivatives contracts and affect the number and/or creditworthiness of available counterparties.\nIn addition, we may transact with counterparties based in the European Union, Canada or other jurisdictions which, like the U.S., are in the process of implementing regulations to regulate derivatives transactions, some of which are currently in effect and impose operational and transactional costs on our derivatives activities.\nUnless we replace our reserves, our reserves and production will naturally decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnless we conduct successful exploration, development and acquisition activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and production, and therefore our cash flows and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, the value of our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nIf we do not fulfill our obligation to drill minimum numbers of wells specified in our joint development agreements, we will lose the right to develop the undeveloped acreage associated with the agreement and any proved undeveloped reserves attributable to such undeveloped acreage.\nIf we do not meet our obligation to drill the minimum number of wells specified in a joint development agreement, we will lose the right to continue to develop the undeveloped acreage covered by the agreement, which would result in the loss of any proved undeveloped reserves attributable to such undeveloped acreage.\nOur estimated oil, natural gas and NGLs reserve quantities and future production rates are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or the underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nNumerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. Our estimates of our proved reserve quantities are based upon our reserve report as of December 31, 2018. Reserve estimation is a subjective process of evaluating underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGLs that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Reserves that are \u201cproved reserves\u201d are those estimated quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under\nexisting economic and operating conditions and that relate to projects for which the extraction of hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain will commence within a reasonable time.\nThe process of estimating oil, natural gas and NGL reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir, and these reports rely upon various assumptions, including assumptions regarding future oil, natural gas and NGL prices, production levels, and operating and development costs. As a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate. Quantities of proved reserves are estimated based on pricing conditions in existence during the period of assessment and costs at the end of the period of assessment. Changes to oil, natural gas and NGL prices in the markets for such commodities may have the impact of shortening the economic lives of certain fields, because it becomes uneconomic to produce all recoverable reserves on such fields, which reduces proved property reserve estimates.\nOver time, we may make material changes to reserve estimates taking into account the results of actual drilling and production. Any significant variance in our assumptions and actual results could greatly affect our estimates of reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs attributable to any particular group of properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery, and estimates of the future net cash flows. In addition, changes in future production cost assumptions could have a significant effect on our proved reserve quantities.\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil, natural gas and NGL reserves.\nYou should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we based the discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12- month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the- month commodities prices for the preceding 12 months without giving effect to derivative transactions. Actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties will be affected by factors such as:\n\u00b7\ncommodity price hedging and actual prices we receive for oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u00b7\nactual cost of development and production expenditures;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of actual development and production; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenues from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating standardized measure may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our company or the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nIf oil prices decline by $10.00 per Bbl, then our standardized measure as of December 31, 2018 excluding hedging impacts would decrease approximately $93.7 million holding all costs constant. If natural gas prices decline by $1.00 per Mcf, then our standardized measure as of December 31, 2018 excluding hedging impacts would decrease by approximately $71.7 million holding all costs constant.\nOver 66% of our estimated proved reserves are located in the Western Anadarko Basin in the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma; however, our 2019 drilling plan is primarily focused on the development of our assets in the Merge play located in the Eastern Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma. Drilling, exploring for and producing, oil, natural gas and NGLs in a different play than the location of our historical operations subjects us to uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOver 66% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2018 were located in the Western Anadarko Basin in the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma, and approximately 58% of our 2018 production was from the Cleveland formation where properties are located in four contiguous counties of Texas and Oklahoma. In 2019, we plan to target the liquids rich Woodford shale and Meramec formations with our rig program in the Merge. As a result of this change in the area of our significant operations, we may be exposed to the impact of different supply and demand factors, regulations, processing or transportation capacity constraints, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services market\nlimitations than we have been exposed to previously in our historical operations in the Western Anadarko Basin. These uncertainties and others inherent in allocating our capital resources to operations in a new geographic area could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur customer base is concentrated, and the loss of any one of our key customers could, therefore, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nHistorically, we have been dependent on a few customers for a significant portion of our revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2018 purchases by our top five customers accounted for approximately 26%, 20%, 19%, 12% and 6%, respectively, of our total oil, natural gas and NGL sales. This concentration of customers may increase our overall exposure to credit risk, and customers will likely be similarly affected by changes in economic and industry conditions. To the extent that any of our major purchasers reduces their purchases of oil, natural gas or NGLs or defaults on their obligations to us, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses, and any inability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our ability to grow.\nIn the future we may make acquisitions of businesses that complement or expand our current business. We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, particularly in light of our low liquidity levels. In addition, increased competition in the areas in which we operate, including the Merge play, may make it more difficult for us to identify or complete acquisitions. Even if we do identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms.\nAny acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u00b7\nthe validity of our assumptions about estimated proved reserves, future production, commodity prices, revenues, capital expenditures, operating expenses and costs;\n\u00b7\nan inability to successfully integrate the assets we acquire;\n\u00b7\nan inability to obtain satisfactory title to the assets we acquire;\n\u00b7\na decrease in our liquidity by using a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions;\n\u00b7\na significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nthe assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which we obtain no or limited indemnity or other recourse;\n\u00b7\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u00b7\nan inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our growing assets; and\n\u00b7\nthe occurrence of other significant changes, such as impairment of oil and natural gas properties, goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges.\nOur decision to acquire a property will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses and seismic data and other information, the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations.\nThe success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired assets into our existing operations. The process of integrating acquired assets may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. In addition, even if we successfully integrate an acquisition, it may not be possible to realize the full benefits we may expect in estimated proved reserves, production volume, cost savings from operating synergies or other benefits anticipated from an acquisition or realize these benefits within the expected time frame. Anticipated benefits of an acquisition may be offset by operating losses relating to changes in commodity prices in oil and natural gas industry conditions, risks and uncertainties relating to the exploratory\nprospects of the combined assets or operations, or an increase in operating or other costs or other difficulties. If we fail to realize the benefits we anticipate from an acquisition, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nDeficiencies of title to our leased interests could significantly affect our financial condition.\nIt is our practice, in acquiring oil and natural gas leases or undivided interests in oil and natural gas leases or other developed rights, not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest to be acquired. Rather, we rely upon the judgment of oil and natural gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental or county clerk\u2019s office to determine mineral ownership before we acquire an oil and gas lease or other developed rights in a specific mineral interest.\nPrior to the drilling of an oil or gas well, it is the normal practice in our industry for the operator of the well to obtain a drilling title opinion from a qualified title attorney to ensure there are no obvious title defects on the property on which the well is to be located. The title attorney would typically research documents that are of record, including liens, taxes and all applicable contracts that burden the property. Frequently, as a result of such examinations, certain curative work must be undertaken to correct defects in the marketability of the title, and such curative work entails expense. Our failure to completely cure any title defects may invalidate our title to the subject property and adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves. Additionally, because a less strenuous title review is conducted on lands where a well has not yet been scheduled, undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. Any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe conduct a substantial portion of our operations through joint development agreements with third parties. Certain of our joint development agreements include complete-to-earn arrangements, whereby we are assigned title to properties from the third-party after we complete wells and, in the case of certain counterparties, after completion reports relating to the wells have been approved by regulatory authorities whose approval may be delayed. Furthermore, certain of our joint development agreements specify that assignments are only to occur when the wells are capable of producing hydrocarbons in paying quantities. These additional conditions to assignment of title may from time to time apply to wells of substantial value. If one of our counterparties assigned title to a well in which we had earned an interest (according to our joint development agreement) to a third-party, our title to such a well could be adversely impacted. In addition, if one of our counterparties becomes a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding, or is placed into receivership, or enters into an assignment for the benefit of creditors, after we had earned ownership of, but before we had received title to, a well, certain creditors of the counterparty may have rights in that well that would rank prior to ours.\nRecently enacted tax legislation may impact our ability to fully utilize our interest expense deductions and net operating loss carryovers to fully offset our taxable income in future periods.\nRecently enacted legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act includes provisions that generally will (i) limit our annual deductions for interest expense to no more than 30% of our \u201cadjusted taxable income\u201d (plus 100% of our business interest income) for the year and (ii) permit us to offset only 80% (rather than 100%) of our taxable income with net operating losses we generated after 2017. Interest expense and net operating losses subject to these limitations may be carried forward by us for use in later years, subject to these limitations. Additionally, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act repealed the domestic manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies. These tax law changes could have the effect of causing us to incur income tax liability and/or obligations under our Tax Receivable Agreement (the \u201cTax Receivable Agreement\u201d) sooner than we otherwise would have incurred such liability or, in certain cases, could cause us to incur income tax liability that we might otherwise not have incurred, in the absence of these tax law changes. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also includes provisions that reduce the maximum federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and eliminate the alternative minimum tax, which would lessen any adverse impact of the limitations described in the preceding sentences.\nCertain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated and new taxes may be imposed as a result of future legislation.\nFrom time to time, legislation is introduced that would, if enacted, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws. These proposed changes have included repealing many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by U.S. oil and gas companies and imposing new fees. Among others, proposed changes have included: elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred; repeal of the percentage depletion deduction for oil and gas\nproperties; repeal of the domestic manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies; increase in the geological and geophysical cost amortization period for independent producers; imposing a per barrel fee on domestically produced oil; and implementation of a fee on non-producing federal oil and gas leases. The recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act did not include any of these proposals, except for the repeal of the domestic manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies. However, it is possible that such provisions could be proposed in the future. The passage of legislation containing some or all of these provisions or any other similar change in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available to us with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to compete effectively with larger companies, which may adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient revenues.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies that have more resources than us. Many of our larger competitors not only drill for and produce oil and natural gas, but also engage in refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low oil, natural gas and NGL prices, to contract for drilling equipment, to secure trained personnel, and to absorb the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations. The oil and natural gas industry has periodically experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, which has delayed development drilling and other exploitation activities and has caused significant price increases. Competition for hiring experienced personnel, particularly in the engineering and technical, accounting and financial reporting, tax and land departments continues to be strong. In addition, competition for attractive oil and natural gas producing properties, oil and natural gas companies, and undeveloped leases and drilling rights remains robust. Any inability to compete effectively with larger companies could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or competitive pressures may force us to implement those new technologies at substantial costs. In addition, other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial, technical, and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures and implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete or if we are unable to use the most advanced commercially available technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe participate in oil and gas leases with third parties who may not be able to fulfill their commitments to our projects.\nWe frequently own less than 100% of the working interest in the oil and gas leases on which we conduct operations, and other parties will own the remaining portion of the working interest. Financial risks are inherent in any operation where the cost of drilling, equipping, completing and operating wells is shared by more than one person. We could be held liable for joint activity obligations of other working interest owners, such as nonpayment of costs and liabilities arising from the actions of other working interest owners. In addition, declines in oil, natural gas and NGL prices may increase the likelihood that some of these working interest owners, particularly those that are smaller and less established, are not able to fulfill their joint activity obligations. A partner may be unable or unwilling to pay its share of project costs, and, in some cases, a partner may declare bankruptcy. In the event any of our project partners do not pay their share of such costs, we would likely have to pay those costs, and we may be unsuccessful in any efforts to recover these costs from our partners, which could materially adversely affect our financial position.\nThe unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oil field services as well as fees for the cancellation of such services could adversely affect our ability to execute development and exploitation plans on a timely basis and within budget, and consequently could adversely affect our anticipated cash flow.\nWe utilize third-party services to maximize the efficiency of our operation. The cost of oil field services typically fluctuates based on demand for those services. We may not be able to contract for such services on a timely basis, or the cost of such services may not remain at a satisfactory or affordable level. Shortages or the high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or personnel, including hydraulic fracturing equipment, supplies and personnel necessary for\nhorizontal drilling, could delay or adversely affect our development and exploitation operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends in part on pipelines, transportation and gathering systems and processing facilities owned by others. Any limitation in the availability of those facilities could interfere with our ability to market our oil, natural gas and NGLs production and could harm our business.\nThe marketability of our oil, natural gas and NGLs production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines and other transportation methods, such as trucks, gathering systems and processing facilities owned by third parties. The amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that can be produced and sold is subject to curtailment in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, physical damage or lack of contracted capacity on such systems. Also, the transfer of our oil, natural gas and NGLs on third-party pipelines may be curtailed or delayed if it does not meet the quality specifications of the pipeline owners. Our access to transportation options, including trucks owned by third parties, can also be affected by U.S. federal and state regulation of oil and gas production and transportation, general economic conditions and changes in supply and demand. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months. In many cases, we are provided only with limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration. Any significant curtailment in gathering system or transportation or processing facility capacity could reduce our ability to market our oil, natural gas and NGLs production and harm our business.\nWe could experience periods of higher costs if commodity prices continue to rise. These increases could reduce our profitability, cash flow and ability to complete development activities as planned.\nHistorically, our capital and operating costs have risen during periods of increasing oil, natural gas and NGL prices. These cost increases result from a variety of factors beyond our control, such as increases in the cost of electricity, steel and other raw materials that we and our vendors rely upon; increased demand for labor, services and materials as drilling activity increases; and increased taxes. Decreased levels of drilling activity in the oil and natural gas industry in recent periods have led to declining costs of some drilling equipment, materials and supplies. However, with the recent increase in commodity prices, such costs may rise faster than increases in our revenue, thereby negatively impacting the profitability of our wells. This impact may be magnified to the extent that our ability to participate in the commodity price increases is limited by our derivative activities.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations. Additionally, we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of:\n\u00b7\nenvironmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater contamination;\n\u00b7\nadverse weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u00b7\nencountering abnormally pressured formations;\n\u00b7\nfacility or equipment malfunctions;\n\u00b7\nmechanical difficulties, such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u00b7\nfires, explosions and ruptures of pipelines;\n\u00b7\npersonal injuries and death; and\n\u00b7\nterrorist attacks targeting oil and natural gas related facilities and infrastructure.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of:\n\u00b7\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u00b7\ndamage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u00b7\npollution and other environmental damage and associated clean-up responsibilities;\n\u00b7\nregulatory investigations, penalties or other sanctions;\n\u00b7\nsuspension of our operations; and\n\u00b7\nrepair and remediation costs.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. Failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approvals or drilling permits could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our properties, and receipt of drilling permits with onerous conditions could increase our compliance costs. In addition, regulations regarding conservation practices and the protection of correlative rights affect our operations by limiting the quantity of oil, natural gas and NGLs we may produce and sell.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations as interpreted and enforced by governmental authorities possessing jurisdiction over various aspects of the exploration, production and transportation of oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as safety matters. Legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their ultimate effect on our operations. We may be required to make significant expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations. The discharge of oil, natural gas, NGLs or other pollutants into the air, soil or water may give rise to significant liabilities on our part to the government, and third parties and may require us to incur substantial costs for remediation.\nSee \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulations\u201d for a further description of the laws and regulations that affect us.\nOur ability to pursue our business strategies may be adversely affected if we incur costs and liabilities due to a failure to comply with environmental regulations or a release of hazardous substances into the environment.\nWe may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of environmental requirements applicable to the operation of our wells, gathering systems and other facilities. These costs and liabilities could arise under a wide range of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including, for example:\n\u00b7\nthe Clean Air Act, or CAA, and comparable state laws and regulations that impose obligations related to air emissions;\n\u00b7\nthe Clean Water Act and Oil Pollution Act, or OPA, and comparable state laws and regulations that impose obligations related to discharges of pollutants into regulated bodies of water;\n\u00b7\nthe Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and comparable state laws that impose requirements for the handling and disposal of waste from our facilities;\n\u00b7\nthe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, and comparable state laws that regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or at locations to which we have sent waste for disposal;\n\u00b7\nthe Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s, or the EPA\u2019s, community right to know regulations under the Title III of CERCLA and comparable state laws that require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations;\n\u00b7\nthe Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, which establishes workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances, and appropriate control measures;\n\u00b7\nthe National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, which requires federal agencies to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment and which may require the preparation of Environmental Assessments and more detailed Environmental Impact Statements that may be made available for public review and comment;\n\u00b7\nthe Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which implements various treaties and conventions between the United States and certain other nations for the protection of migratory birds and, pursuant to which the taking, killing, or possessing of migratory birds is unlawful without a permit, thereby potentially requiring the implementation of operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal, or permanent ban on operations in affected areas; and\n\u00b7\nthe Endangered Species Act, or ESA, and analogous state laws, which seek to ensure that activities do not jeopardize endangered or threatened animals, fish and plant species, nor destroy or modify the critical habitat of such species. In particular, if the Lesser Prarie Chicken is listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA, it could force us to incur additional costs and delay or otherwise limit or terminate our operations in significant portions of the Anadarko Basin.\nWe may incur significant delays, costs and liabilities as a result of federal, state and local environmental, health and safety requirements applicable to exploration, development and production activities. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain a variety of permits or other authorizations governing our air emissions, water discharges, waste disposal, development in regulated wetlands or waters, or other environmental impacts associated with drilling, production and product transportation pipelines or other operations; regulate the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling, fracturing and completion processes; limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness, frontier and other protected areas or that contain regulated wetlands or other waters; require remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits; and/or impose substantial liabilities for spills, pollution or failure to comply with regulatory filing requirements. In addition, these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time; however, future changes to environmental laws and regulations remain uncertain. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes, including the RCRA, CERCLA, the federal OPA and analogous state laws and regulations, impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where petroleum or hazardous substances or other waste products have been disposed of or otherwise released. More stringent laws and regulations, including laws related to climate change and greenhouse gases or induced seismicity, may be adopted in the future. If there are more expensive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to the oil and natural gas industry, it could result in increased costs of doing business and consequently affect profitability. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment. We are also subject to many other environmental requirements delineated in \u201cBusiness-Environmental Matters and Regulation.\u201d\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and other oil and gas production activities as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs, additional operating restrictions or delays, which could adversely affect our production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We routinely utilize hydraulic fracturing techniques in our oil and natural gas drilling and completion programs. The process is typically regulated by state oil and\nnatural gas commissions. However, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA, in states where the EPA is the permitting authority and released guidance in February 2014 on regulatory requirements for companies that plan to conduct hydraulic fracturing using diesel in those states. Congress has also considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process and various agencies have considered or pursued rulemakings related to hydraulic fracturing.\nSome states, including those in which we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations under certain circumstances. For example, in 2011 Texas adopted the Hydraulic Fracturing Chemical Disclosure Rule, requiring public disclosure of chemicals in fluids used in the hydraulic fracturing process for drilling permits issued after February 1, 2012. In addition, the OKCC has adopted rules prohibiting water pollution resulting from hydraulic fracturing operations and requiring disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. The mandatory disclosure of information regarding the constituents of hydraulic fracturing fluids could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based upon allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect the environment.\nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has imposed more stringent emissions, monitoring, inspection, maintenance, and repair requirements on Barnett Shale operators to minimize Volatile Organic Compound, or VOC, releases.\nIn addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. If state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we are currently conducting operations, or in the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nThere are also certain governmental reviews conducted that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality coordinated an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices, and a committee of the United States House of Representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices. Furthermore, a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. On December 13, 2016, the EPA released a study of the potential adverse effects that hydraulic fracturing activities (including water acquisition, chemical mixing, well injection, and disposal and reuse) may have on water quality and public health, concluding that there is scientific evidence that hydraulic fracturing activities could impact drinking water resources in the United States under some circumstances.\nThe EPA finalized a rule prohibiting discharges of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing to publicly-owned treatment works. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities, referred to as centralized waste treatment, or CWT, facilities, accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater and will evaluate whether to revise discharge limits from CWT facilities. In addition, the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Natural Gas Subcommittee of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board conducted a review of hydraulic fracturing issues and practices and made recommendations to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulic fracturing completion methods. Ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, or other statutory and/or regulatory mechanisms.\nAlso, in 2015, the U.S. Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, adopted rules regarding well stimulation, chemical disclosures and other requirements for hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands; however, these rules were rescinded by rule in December 2017. Effective December 2016, the NPS, finalized updates to its regulations governing non-federal oil and gas rights, affecting various approval exemptions and addressing well stimulation, chemical disclosures and other requirements for hydraulic fracturing. However, this regulation may be further reviewed for potential rescission or revision pursuant to Executive Order No. 13783 titled \u201cPromoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth,\u201d dated March 28, 2017.\nIn addition, as discussed further below, state and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on seismic events potentially associated with oil and gas operations, including injection well disposal and the hydraulic fracturing process.\nFurther, since 2012, oil and gas operations (production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution) have been subject to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards, or NSPS, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, or NESHAPS, programs. The EPA rules also include NSPS standards for completions of hydraulically fractured gas wells. These standards include the reduced emission completion techniques developed in the EPA\u2019s Natural Gas STAR program along with pit flaring of gas not sent to the gathering line. The standards are applicable to newly drilled and fractured wells as well as existing wells that are refractured. Further, the regulations under NESHAPS include maximum achievable control technology, or MACT, standards for those glycol dehydrators and storage vessels at major sources of hazardous air pollutants not currently subject to MACT standards. In October 2012, several challenges to the EPA\u2019s rules were filed by various parties, including environmental groups and industry associations. In a January 16, 2013 unopposed motion to hold this litigation in abeyance, the EPA indicated that it may reconsider some aspects of the rules. The EPA has since reconsidered several aspects of the rules and may continue to make changes. For example in 2015, the EPA finalized a final rule defining \u201clow pressure gas well\u201d and removing \u201cconnected in parallel\u201d from the definition of storage vessels in the New Source Performance Standard and in March 12, 2018 adopted amendments to two narrow provisions for the collection of fugitive emission components at well sites and compressor stations. Further, on October 15, 2018, EPA proposed rule to amend certain of these rules related to fugitive emissions requirements, well site pneumatic pump standards, the requirements for certification of closed vent systems by a professional engineer, and the alternative means of emissions limitations provisions. Depending on the outcome of judicial proceedings and regulatory actions, the rules may be further modified or rescinded or the EPA may issue new rules as proposed or otherwise. We have reported some of our facilities as being subject to these rules and have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to control emissions, and to satisfy reporting and other administrative requirements associated with these rules. We continue to evaluate the effect these rules will have on our business. In addition, the EPA finalized new rules to regulate emissions of methane and volatile organic compounds from new and modified sources in the oil and gas sector effective August 2, 2016. The EPA also finalized a rule regarding the alternative criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air quality permitting purposes. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements across the oil and gas industry. BLM adopted rules effective on January 17, 2017 to reduce venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and natural gas production activities on onshore federal and Indian leases. EPA delayed some requirements and in September 28 adopted a rule to rescind several requirements and significantly revise others. A challenge to the September 2018 rule is pending in federal court. Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas, including from the developing shale formations, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells, increased compliance costs and time, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to induced seismicity in connection with oil and gas activities could result in increased costs, additional operating restrictions or delays, and litigation risks which could adversely affect our operations\nState and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between an observed increase in minor seismic activity and tremors and both the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste waters and the hydraulic fracturing process. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. In some instances, operators of injection wells in the vicinity of minor seismic events have reduced injection volumes or suspended operations, often voluntarily. Some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations to account for induced seismicity. For example, the Texas Railroad Commission rules allow the Commission to modify, suspend, or terminate a permit based on a determination that the permitted injection well activity is likely to be contributing to seismic activity. The OKCC also asserts authority to shut down injection wells that it considers linked to induced seismicity, and has recently taken other steps to regulate injection wells that may contribute to induced seismicity. For example, since 2015 the OKCC has mandated reductions in oil and gas wastewater disposal well volumes to address potential induced seismicity in Oklahoma; implementation has involved reductions of injection or shut-ins of disposal wells. In February 2017, the OKCC issued a directive aimed at limiting the growth in future underground injection disposal rates into the Arbuckle formation in an area with seismicity issues. In February 2018, the OKCC announced seismicity guidelines for hydraulic fracturing operations in the SCOOP and STACK plays. Regulatory agencies are continuing to study possible linkage between injection activity and induced seismicity and also possible linkages of induced seismicity to the hydraulic fracturing process. Third-party lawsuits for property damage and other remedies based on allegations of induced seismicity have been brought against other energy companies.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce; and actual impacts of climate change like extreme weather conditions could adversely affect our operations.\nIn December 2009, the EPA officially published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases, or GHGs, present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on its findings, the EPA promulgated regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act, including one rule that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources. In addition, on October 30, 2009, the EPA published a final rule requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States. On November 9, 2010, the EPA issued final rules to expand its existing GHG reporting rule to include onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities with reporting of GHG emissions from such facilities required on an annual basis. In 2015, the EPA added reporting of GHG emissions from gathering and boosting systems, completions and workovers of oil wells using hydraulic fracturing, and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines to the GHG reporting rule. We are currently required to monitor and report GHG emissions under this rule, and operational and/or regulatory changes could increase the burden of compliance with GHG emissions monitoring and reporting requirements.\nAs previously mentioned, federal regulations require methane reductions from new or modified oil and gas sources. On November 10, 2016, the EPA issued a final ICR that would have required numerous oil and gas companies to provide information regarding methane emissions from existing oil and gas facilities, but EPA withdrew the ICR on March 2, 2017. The U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce. In addition, international, federal, regional and local regulatory initiatives that target GHGs could adversely affect the marketability of the oil and natural gas we produce.\nIn 2015, the United States participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement came into force on November 4, 2016, requiring, countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. The United States\u2019 has expressed an intention to withdraw from participation\nin the Paris Agreement, but some state and local governments have expressed intentions to take GHG-related actions. In connection with the decision to adopt the Paris Agreement, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the \u201cIPCC\u201d) prepared a special report focused on the impacts of a specific increase in the average global temperature above pre-industrial levels and related GHG emission pathways, which was released on October 6, 2018 (\u201c2018 IPCC Report\u201d). The 2018 IPCC Report concludes that severe impacts of climate change could arise with a global warming of 1.5\u00baC above pre-industrial levels and that, if the increase continues at the current rate, global warming is likely to reach this temperature rise between 2030 and 2052. The report concludes that the measures set forth in the Paris Agreement are insufficient and that more aggressive targets and measures will be needed. Due to the uncertainties surrounding the regulation of and other risks associated with GHG emissions, we cannot predict the financial impact of related developments on our operations. To the extent adopted, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornados and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. Another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations.\nWe may face unanticipated water and other waste disposal costs.\nWe may be subject to regulation that restricts our ability to discharge water produced as part of our oil or gas production operations. Productive zones frequently contain water that must be removed in order for the oil or gas to produce, and our ability to remove and dispose of sufficient quantities of water from the various zones will determine whether we can produce oil or gas in commercial quantities. The produced water currently is transported from the lease and injected into disposal wells. Some states, including Oklahoma and Texas, also assert the authority to shut down disposal wells that are deemed to contribute to induced seismicity, or seismic activity that is caused by human activity. Since 2015, the OKCC has implemented a plan calling for mandatory reductions in oil and gas wastewater disposal well volumes to address potential induced seismicity in Oklahoma. Further, in February 2017, the OKCC issued a directive aimed at limiting the growth in future underground injection disposal rates into the Arbuckle formation in an area with seismicity issues. The availability of disposal wells with sufficient capacity to receive all of the water produced from our wells may affect our ability to produce our wells. Also, the EPA has prohibited the disposal of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing into publicly owned treatment facilities through a \u201czero discharge\u201d pretreatment standard. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities, referred to as centralized waste treatment, or CWT, facilities, accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater and will evaluate whether to revise discharge limits from CWT facilities. Therefore, across the oil and gas industry, the cost to transport and dispose of that water, including the cost of complying with regulations concerning water disposal, may increase. This increase may reduce our profitability.\nIf water produced from our projects fails to meet the quality requirements of applicable regulatory agencies, our wells produce water in excess of the applicable volumetric permit limits, the disposal wells fail to meet the requirements of all applicable regulatory agencies, or we are unable to secure access to disposal wells with sufficient capacity to accept all of the produced water, we may have to shut in wells, reduce drilling activities, or upgrade facilities for water handling or treatment. The costs to dispose of this produced water may increase if any of the following occur:\n\u00b7\nwe cannot obtain future permits from applicable regulatory agencies;\n\u00b7\nwater of lesser quality or requiring additional treatment is produced;\n\u00b7\nour wells produce excess water;\n\u00b7\nnew laws and regulations require water to be disposed in a different manner; or\n\u00b7\ncosts to transport the produced water to the disposal wells increase.\nWe conduct a substantial portion of our operations through farm-outs, areas of mutual interest and other joint development agreements. These agreements subject us to additional risks that could have a material adverse effect on the success of these operations, our financial position and our results of operations.\nWe conduct a substantial portion of our operations through joint development agreements with third parties, including ExxonMobil. We may also enter into other joint development agreements in the future. These third parties may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint development agreement, such as the obligation to contribute capital or pay carried or other costs associated with the joint development agreement. The performance of these third-party obligations, including the ability of the third parties to satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, is outside our control. If these parties do not satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur joint development agreements may involve risks not otherwise present when exploring and developing properties directly, including, for example:\n\u00b7\nour joint development partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions;\n\u00b7\nour joint development partners may not pay their share of the joint development agreement obligations, leaving us liable for their share of joint development liabilities;\n\u00b7\nwe may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by our joint development partners;\n\u00b7\nour joint development partners may be in a position to take actions contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives; and\n\u00b7\ndisputes between us and our joint development partners may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses.\nThe risks described above, the failure to continue our joint ventures or to resolve disagreements with our joint development partners could adversely affect our ability to transact the business of such joint development, which would in turn negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption or financial loss.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications, to operate our businesses, and the maintenance of our financial and other records has long been dependent upon such technologies. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. Deliberate attacks on, or unintentional events affecting, our systems or infrastructure, the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud could lead to corruption or loss of our proprietary data and potentially sensitive data, delays of delivery of natural gas and NGLs, difficulty in completing and settling transactions, challenges in maintaining our books and records, communication interruptions, environmental damage, personal injury, property damage and other operational disruptions, as well as damage to our reputation, financial condition and cash flows. Further, as cyber incidents continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. In addition, new U.S. laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of personal information may potentially elevate our compliance costs. Any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations, including as a result of a cyber incident, could result in significant penalties and liability to us. Additionally, if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws, we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result.\nLoss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer based programs, including our well operations information, seismic data, electronic data processing and accounting data. If any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, possible consequences include our loss of communication links, inability to find, produce, process and sell oil, natural gas and NGLs and inability to\nautomatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Relating to Financings and Ownership:\nWe may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe have substantial debt obligations and our ongoing capital and operating expenditures will vastly exceed the revenue we expect to receive from our operations in the near future. If we are unable to raise substantial additional funding or consummate significant asset sales on a timely basis and/or on acceptable terms, we may be required to significantly curtail our exploration, development and production activities.\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to, among other factors, our ability to monetize assets, our ability to obtain financing or refinance existing indebtedness, our ability to continue our cost cutting efforts, the production rates achieved from our discoveries, oil and natural gas prices, the number of commercially viable hydrocarbon discoveries made and the quantities of hydrocarbons discovered, the speed and cost with which we can bring such discoveries to production and the actual cost of exploration, appraisal and development of our prospects. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding on a timely basis and on satisfactory terms, or at all. In addition, no assurance can be given that any such funding, if obtained, will be adequate to meet our capital needs and support our growth. If additional funding cannot be obtained on a timely basis and on satisfactory terms, then our operations would be materially negatively impacted.\nIf we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may find it necessary to file a voluntary petition for reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code in order to provide us additional time to identify an appropriate solution to our financial situation and implement a plan of reorganization aimed at improving our capital structure. For additional information, please see \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d contained herein.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm contains an explanatory paragraph as to our ability to continue as a going concern, which could prevent us from obtaining new financing on reasonable terms, or at all.\nWe have incurred significant operating and net losses and may continue to incur net operating losses. Without additional sources of capital or a significant restructuring of our balance sheet, these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which means that we may be unable to continue operations for the foreseeable future or realize assets and discharge liabilities in the ordinary course of operations. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph with respect to this uncertainty in its report that is included with our financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Such an opinion may materially and adversely affect the price per share of our common stock and may otherwise limit our ability to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities or otherwise. Further, the perception that we may be unable to continue as a going concern may impede our ability to raise additional funds or operate our business due to concerns with respect to our ability to discharge our contractual obligations.\nWe have prepared our financial statements on a going concern basis, which contemplates that we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. Our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Without additional capital or a significant restructuring of our balance sheet, however, we may be unable to continue as a viable entity, in which case our stockholders may lose all or some of their investment in us.\nWe will be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for certain tax benefits we may receive (or be deemed to receive), and the amounts of such payments could be significant.\nWe entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with JEH and the Class B shareholders. This agreement generally provides for the payment by us of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize (or are deemed to realize in certain circumstances) as a result of (i) the tax basis increases resulting from the Class B shareholders\u2019 exchange of JEH Units for shares of Class A common stock (or resulting from a sale of JEH Units to us for cash) and (ii) imputed interest deemed to be paid by us as a result of, and\nadditional tax basis arising from, any payments we make under the Tax Receivable Agreement. In addition, payments we make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be increased by any interest accrued from the due date (without extensions) of the corresponding tax return.\nThe payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement are our obligations and not obligations of JEH. For purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, cash savings in tax generally are calculated by comparing our actual tax liability to the amount we would have been required to pay had we not been able to utilize any of the tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. Any payments are made within a designated period of time following the filing of the tax return where we utilize such tax benefits to reduce taxes in a given year. The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired, unless we exercise our right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement by making the termination payment specified in the agreement.\nThe actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of the exchanges of JEH Units, the price of Class A common stock at the time of each exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable, the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future and the tax rate then applicable, and the portion of our payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement constituting imputed interest or depletable, depreciable or amortizable basis. We expect that the payments that we will be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement could be substantial.\nThe payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will not be conditioned upon a holder of rights under the Tax Receivable Agreement having a continued ownership interest in either JEH or us.\nIn certain circumstances including transactions involving a change in control, significant payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nUnder certain circumstances, we could become obligated to make significant payments under our Tax Receivable Agreement that could exceed or represent a substantial portion of our liquidity and market capitalization. These payment obligations could be to persons without significant equity ownership in us at the time such obligation arises. If we elect to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement early or it is terminated early due to certain mergers or other changes of control, we would be required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. Such calculation of anticipated future tax benefits will be based upon certain assumptions and deemed events set forth in the Tax Receivable Agreement, including the assumptions that (i) we have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize such benefits, (ii) any JEH Units that the Class B shareholders or their permitted transferees own on the termination date are exchanged for shares of our Class A common stock on the termination date and (iii) the amount of future depletion deductions to which we are entitled is based on recoverable reserves and rates of recovery reflected in the most recent reserve reports and estimates available on the termination date. Any early termination payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of such future benefits.\nIn these situations, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control due to the additional transaction cost a potential acquirer may attribute to satisfying such obligations. For example, if the Tax Receivable Agreement had been terminated at December 31, 2018, we estimate that the termination payment would be approximately $52.0 million (calculated based on the 21% U.S. federal corporate income tax rate under the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and applicable state and local income tax rates and using a discount rate equal to LIBOR, plus 100 basis points, applied against the anticipated undiscounted liability and assuming a market value of our Class A common stock equal to $0.34 per share, the closing price on December 31, 2018). The foregoing is merely an estimate and the actual payment could differ materially. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nPayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we will determine. The holders of rights under the Tax Receivable Agreement will not reimburse us for any payments previously made under the Tax Receivable Agreement if such basis increases or other benefits are subsequently disallowed, except that excess payments made to any Class B shareholder will be netted against payments otherwise to be made, if any, to such Class B shareholder after our determination of such excess. As a result, in such circumstances, we could make payments that are greater than our actual cash tax savings, if any, and may not be able to recoup those payments, which could adversely affect our liquidity.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and benefit from certain reduced governance and disclosure requirements, including that our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot be certain if the omission of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nCurrently, we are a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d meaning that our outstanding common stock held by nonaffiliates had a value of less than $250 million at the end of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, meaning our auditors are not required to attest to the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. As a result, investors and others may be less comfortable with the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal controls and the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in internal controls go undetected may increase. In addition, as a smaller reporting company, we take advantage of our ability to provide certain other less comprehensive disclosures in our SEC filings, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports and simplified executive compensation disclosures. Consequently, it may be more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects, as the information we provide to stockholders may be different from what one might receive from other public companies in which one hold shares. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the availability, terms and cost of capital, increases in interest rates or a reduction in credit rating. These changes could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce our cash flow available for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage. Recent and continuing disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations. A significant reduction in our cash flows from operations or the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results.\nThe Jones family and certain other stockholders control a significant percentage of Jones Energy, Inc.\u2019s voting power and have the ability to take actions that may conflict with your interests.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Jones family, Metalmark Capital and affiliates of JVL Advisors, L.L.C. held approximately 42.1% of the combined voting power of Jones Energy, Inc. These stockholders are entitled to act separately in their own respective interests with respect to their ownership interests in Jones Energy, Inc., and collectively have the ability to substantially influence the election of the members of our board of directors, thereby potentially controlling our management and affairs. In addition, they have significant influence over all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including mergers and other material transactions.\nIf we fail to develop or maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud, which would likely have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a publicly traded company. To comply with the requirements of being a publicly traded company, we may need to implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and hire additional accounting, finance, tax and legal staff. Our efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls may not be successful, and we may be unable to maintain effective controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which we refer to as Section 404. For example, Section 404 requires us, among other things, to annually review and report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Any failure to develop, implement or maintain effective\ninternal controls or to improve our internal controls could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Given the difficulties inherent in the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, we can provide no assurance as to our conclusions about the effectiveness of our internal controls, and we may incur significant costs in our efforts to comply with Section 404. If one or more material weaknesses persist or if we fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately report our financial results could be adversely affected. Ineffective internal controls could also subject us to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of confidence in our reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe loss of senior management or technical personnel could adversely affect our operations.\nOur success will depend to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and key operations personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on us. We do not maintain insurance against the loss of any of these individuals. Our business will also be dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Since the fourth quarter of 2014, the prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs were extremely volatile and declined significantly. Key employees may depart because of uncertainty during times of commodity price volatility. Acquiring and keeping these personnel could prove more difficult or cost substantially more than estimated. This could cause us to incur greater costs, or prevent us from pursuing our development and exploitation strategy as quickly as we would otherwise wish to do.\nWe currently have no plans to pay regular dividends on our common stock, so you may not receive funds without selling your common stock.\nWe currently have no plans to pay regular dividends on our Class A common stock. Any payment of dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition and business opportunities, the restrictions in our debt agreements, and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, you may have to sell some or all of your Class A common stock in order to generate cash flow from your investment.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market or the issuance of securities senior to our common stock, or the perception that these sales may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in stock offerings.\nA large percentage of our shares of common stock are held by a relatively small number of investors. Further, we entered into registration rights agreements with certain of those investors pursuant to which we have filed a registration statement with the SEC to facilitate potential future sales of such shares by them. Sales by us or our stockholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public markets, or even the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline or could impair our ability to raise capital through a future sale of, or pay for acquisitions using, our equity securities.\nWe may issue common stock or other equity securities senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance acquisitions, to adjust our leverage ratio, and to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of warrants and options, or for other reasons. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales or issuances of shares of our common stock or other equity securities, or the availability of shares of common stock or such other equity securities for future sale or issuance, will have on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe will incur corporate income tax liabilities on taxable income allocated to us by JEH with respect to JEH Units we own, which may be substantial. JEH is required to make cash tax distributions under its operating agreement. JEH\u2019s ability to make tax distributions, and our ability to pay taxes and the Tax Receviable Agreement liability may be limited by our structure and available liquidity. To the extent that we incur cash income tax liabilities or JEH is required to make cash tax distributions and cash payments of the Tax Receviable Agreement liability it would impact our liquidity and reduce cash available for other uses.\nUnder the terms of its operating agreement, JEH is generally required to make quarterly pro rata cash tax distributions to its unitholders (including us) based on income allocated to such unitholders through the end of each relevant quarter, as adjusted to take into account our good faith projections of taxable income or loss for the remainder of the calendar year, to the extent JEH has cash available for such distributions and subject to certain other restrictions described below. During 2016, JEH generated taxable income, resulting in the payment during 2016 of $17.3 million in cash tax distributions to JEH unitholders (other than us). As a result of JEH\u2019s 2016 taxable income (all of which is passed-through and taxed to us and JEH\u2019s other unitholders), during 2017 we made further income tax payments to federal and\nstate taxing authorities of $2.3 million and JEH made further tax distributions to JEH unitholders (other than us) of $0.6 million. During 2017, JEH did not generate taxable income, therefore we did not make any additional tax payments nor did JEH make any additional tax distributions other than those made as a result of 2016 JEH taxable income. Based on our 2018 operating activity and our initial 2019 operating budget and information available as of this filing, we do not anticipate that we will be required to make any additional tax payments or that JEH will make any additional tax distributions during 2019. Estimating the tax distributions required under the operating agreement is imprecise by nature, highly uncertain, and dependent upon a variety of factors.\nWe are classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, in most states in which JEH does business, for state income tax purposes. Under current law, we are subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates of up to 21%, and to state income tax at rates that vary from state to state, on the net income allocated to us by JEH with respect to the JEH Units we own. We are a holding company with our sole asset consisting of our ownership in JEH and have no independent means of generating revenue. JEH is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and as such is not subject to federal income tax (other than as a withholding agent). Instead, taxable income is allocated to holders of JEH Units, including the JEH Units we own. Under the terms of its operating agreement, JEH is obligated to make tax distributions to holders of its units, including us, subject to the conditions described below. Our ability to cause JEH to make tax distributions, which generally will be pro rata with respect to all outstanding JEH Units, in an amount sufficient to allow us to pay our taxes and make any payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement, is subject to various factors, including the cash requirements and financial condition of JEH, compliance by JEH or its subsidiaries with restrictions, covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future indebtedness, including under our notes and the Revolver, and other agreements entered into with third parties. As a result, it is possible that Jones Energy, Inc. will not have sufficient cash to pay taxes and make payments under the Tax Receviable Agreement liability.\nSee \u201cRisk Factors-We will be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for certain tax benefits we may receive (or be deemed to receive), and the amounts of such payments could be significant.\u201d", "PERMNO": 14026, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "JONEQ"}
