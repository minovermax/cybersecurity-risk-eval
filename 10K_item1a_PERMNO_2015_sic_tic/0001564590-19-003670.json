The Company\u2019s business is highly sensitive to global and national economic conditions as well as economic conditions in the industries and markets it serves. Negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for the Company\u2019s equipment and services. The yearly demand for commercial vehicles may increase or decrease more than overall gross domestic product in markets the Company serves, which are principally North America and Europe. Demand for commercial vehicles may also be affected by the introduction of new vehicles and technologies by the Company or its competitors.\nCompetition and Prices. The Company operates in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales and pricing. Financial results depend largely on the ability to develop, manufacture and market competitive products that profitably meet customer demand.\nProduction Costs and Supplier Capacity. The Company\u2019s products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs. Commodity or component price increases and significant shortages of component products may adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial results or use of its production capacity. Many of the Company\u2019s suppliers also supply automotive manufacturers, and factors that adversely affect the automotive industry can also have adverse effects on these suppliers and the Company. Supplier delivery performance can be adversely affected if increased demand for these suppliers\u2019 products exceeds their production capacity. Unexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase the Company\u2019s cost of doing business or disrupt the Company\u2019s or its suppliers\u2019 operations.\nLiquidity Risks, Credit Ratings and Costs of Funds. Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit the Company\u2019s sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of customers, dealers and suppliers. A lowering of the Company\u2019s credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowing and adversely affect access to capital markets. The Company\u2019s Financial Services segment obtains funds for its operations from commercial paper, medium-term notes and bank debt. If the markets for commercial paper, medium-term notes and bank debt do not provide the necessary liquidity in the future, the Financial Services segment may experience increased costs or may have to limit its financing of retail and wholesale assets. This could result in a reduction of the number of vehicles the Company is able to produce and sell to customers.\nThe Financial Services Industry is Highly Competitive. The Company\u2019s Financial Services segment competes with banks, other commercial finance companies and financial services firms which may have lower costs of borrowing, higher leverage or market share goals that result in a willingness to offer lower interest rates, which may lead to decreased margins, lower market share or both. A decline in the Company\u2019s truck unit sales and a decrease in truck residual values due to lower used truck pricing are also factors which may affect the Company\u2019s Financial Services segment.\nThe Financial Services Segment is Subject to Credit Risk. The Financial Services segment is exposed to the risk of loss arising from the failure of a customer, dealer or counterparty to meet the terms of the loans, leases and derivative contracts with the Company. Although the financial assets of the Financial Services segment are secured by underlying equipment collateral, in the event a customer cannot meet its obligations to the Company, there is a risk that the value of the underlying collateral will not be sufficient to recover the amounts owed to the Company, resulting in credit losses.\nInterest-Rate Risks. The Financial Services segment is subject to interest-rate risks, because increases in interest rates can reduce demand for its products, increase borrowing costs and potentially reduce interest margins. PFS uses derivative contracts to match the interest rate characteristics of its debt to the interest rate characteristics of its finance receivables in order to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates.\nInformation Technology. The Company relies on information technology systems and networks to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of its business processes and activities. These computer systems and networks may be subject to disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components; power outages; hardware failures; computer viruses; or outside parties attempting to disrupt the Company\u2019s business or gain unauthorized access to the Company\u2019s electronic data. The Company maintains and continues to invest in protections to guard against such events. Examples of these protections include conducting third-party penetration tests, implementing software detection and prevention tools, event monitoring, and disaster recoverability. Additionally the Company maintains a cybersecurity insurance policy. Despite these safeguards, there remains a risk of system disruptions, unauthorized access and data loss.\nIf the Company\u2019s computer systems were to be damaged, disrupted or breached, it could impact data availability and integrity, result in a theft of the Company\u2019s intellectual property or lead to unauthorized disclosure of confidential information of the Company\u2019s customers, suppliers and employees. Security breaches could also result in a violation of U.S. and international privacy and other laws and subject the Company to various litigations and governmental proceedings. These events could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition, damage its reputation, disrupt operations and negatively impact competitiveness in the marketplace.\nPolitical, Regulatory and Economic Risks\nMultinational Operations. The Company\u2019s global operations are exposed to political, economic and other risks and events beyond its control in the countries in which the Company operates. The Company may be adversely affected by political instabilities, fuel shortages or interruptions in utility or transportation systems, natural calamities, wars, terrorism and labor strikes. Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies and international trade policies may impact demand for the Company\u2019s products, financial results and competitive position. PACCAR\u2019s global operations are subject to extensive trade, competition and anti-corruption laws and regulations that could impose significant compliance costs.\nU.K. Exit from the European Union. In March 2017, the United Kingdom (U.K.) invoked Article 50 of their treaty with the European Union signaling their intent to leave the EU. Under the EU Treaty the U.K. had two years to negotiate terms of their exit with the EU. Although a preliminary agreement between the EU and the U.K. Government was made, it was not ratified by the U.K. Parliament. If the terms of the exit from the EU are not agreed by March 29, 2019, it is anticipated that the standard trade protocols of the World Trade Organization (WTO) would become effective (\u201cHard Brexit\u201d).\nThe Company manufactures medium- and heavy-duty DAF trucks in the U.K. which are sold primarily in the U.K. and to a lesser extent in Europe and other world markets. In 2018, approximately 10% of the Company\u2019s worldwide truck production was manufactured in the U.K. Most of the truck components used in the manufacturing of trucks in the U.K., as well as aftermarket parts are sourced from the EU. In the event of a Hard Brexit, it is anticipated that there would be an increase in tariffs from truck components and parts from the EU which would increase the cost of all trucks and parts in the U.K. It is expected that there would also be an increase in tariffs on trucks sold from the U.K. to the EU which would lead to higher costs for trucks imported from the U.K into the EU. The imposition of tariffs and border controls would most likely lead to longer lead times in the supply chain from the EU and the U.K. In the event of a Hard Brexit, the Company anticipates that after a period of time, changes would be made to the supply chain to minimize the effects of tariffs and delays. The higher cost of trucks and parts may impact manufacturing and parts sales and margins which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nEnvironmental Regulations. The Company\u2019s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs. The Company could experience higher research and development and manufacturing costs due to changes in government requirements for its products, including changes in emissions, fuel, greenhouse gas or other regulations.\nLitigation, Product Liability and Regulatory. The Company\u2019s products are subject to recall for environmental, performance and safety-related issues. Product recalls, lawsuits, regulatory actions or increases in the reserves the Company establishes for contingencies may increase the Company\u2019s costs and lower profits. Due to the international nature of the Company\u2019s business, some products are also subject to international trade regulations, including customs and import / export related laws and regulations, government embargoes and sanctions prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries, as well as anti-corruption laws. The Company\u2019s reputation and its brand names are valuable assets, and claims or regulatory actions, even if unsuccessful or without merit, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation and brand images because of adverse publicity.\nCurrency Exchange and Translation. The Company\u2019s consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, while significant operations are denominated in the currencies of other countries. Currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect the Company\u2019s assets, liabilities and results of operations through both translation and transaction risk, as reported in the Company\u2019s financial statements. The Company uses certain derivative financial instruments and localized production of its products to reduce, but not eliminate, the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nAccounting Estimates. In the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented. Certain of these estimates, judgments and assumptions, such as residual values on operating leases, the allowance for credit losses and product warranty are particularly sensitive. If actual results are different from estimates used by management, they may have a material impact on the financial statements. For additional disclosures regarding accounting estimates, see \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d under Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nTaxes. Changes in statutory income tax rates in the countries in which the Company operates impact the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. Changes to other taxes or the adoption of other new tax legislation could affect the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes and related tax assets and liabilities.", "PERMNO": 60506, "SIC": 3711, "TIC": "PCAR"}
