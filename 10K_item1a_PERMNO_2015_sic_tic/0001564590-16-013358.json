{"cik": "873303", "company": "Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nFactors That Could Affect Future Results\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nMost of our product candidates are at an early stage of development and may never receive regulatory approval.\nOur most advanced product candidate is eteplirsen for which the FDA is reviewing a new drug application (\u201cNDA\u201d) with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (\u201cPDUFA\u201d) action date of May 26, 2016. Eteplirsen is still being evaluated in several clinical studies, including a confirmatory clinical trial. The exon 53-skipping product candidate, which we are working on with the SKIP-NMD consortium, is currently in the clinic and we have completed Part I and have started Part II of a Phase I/IIa clinical trial in the E.U. We are also in the process of conducting a placebo-controlled dose titration study for our exon 45-skipping product candidate. Additionally, we are working towards initiating a clinical trial in the U.S. and the E.U. for exon 45- and 53-skipping product candidates and have satisfactorily responded to the FDA\u2019s inquiries on pre-clinical data for this study relating to our exon-53 product candidate. The remainder of our product candidates are in early stages of development. These product candidates will require significant further development, financial resources and personnel to develop into commercially viable products and obtain regulatory approval, if at all. Currently, eteplirsen, our exon 45-skipping product candidate, the exon 53-skipping product candidate we are developing with the SKIP-NMD consortium, each for DMD, and AVI-7100 in influenza are in active clinical development. AVI-7537 in Ebola and AVI-7288 in Marburg were being developed through a program with the U.S. Department of Defense (the \u201cDoD\u201d) and further development is conditioned in part on obtaining additional funding, collaborations or emergency use. Our other product candidates, including our anti-bacterials, are in preclinical development or inactive. We expect that much of our effort and many of our expenditures over the next several years will be devoted to clinical development and regulatory activities associated with eteplirsen and other exon-skipping candidates as part of our larger pan-exon strategy in DMD, our infectious disease candidates, our proprietary chemistry, and other potential therapeutic areas that provide long-term market opportunities. We may be delayed, restricted, or unable to further develop our active and other product candidates or successfully obtain approvals needed to market them.\nOur RNA-targeted antisense technology has not been incorporated into a therapeutic commercial product and is still at an early stage of development.\nOur RNA-targeted platforms, utilizing proprietary PMO-based technology, have not been incorporated into a therapeutic commercial product and are still at an early stage of development. This technology is used in all of our product candidates, including eteplirsen. Although we have conducted and are in the process of conducting clinical studies with eteplirsen, an exon 45-skipping product candidate and an exon 53-skipping product candidate and preclinical studies with our other product candidates that use our PMO-based antisense technology, additional studies may be needed to determine the safety and efficacy of our PMO-based antisense technology. In addition, nonclinical models used to evaluate the activity and toxicity of product candidate compounds are not necessarily predictive of toxicity or efficacy of these compounds in the treatment of human disease. As such, there may be substantially different results observed in clinical trials from those observed in preclinical studies. Any failures or setbacks in developing or utilizing our PMO-based technology, including adverse effects in humans, could have a detrimental impact on our product candidate pipeline and our ability to maintain and/or enter into new corporate collaborations regarding these technologies, which would negatively affect our business and financial condition.\nWe have been granted orphan drug designations in the U.S. and in the E.U. for certain of our product candidates, however, there can be no guarantee that we will maintain orphan status for these product candidates nor that we will receive orphan drug approval and hence prevent third parties from developing and commercializing products that are competitive to these product candidates in the absence of other barriers to entry.\nTo date we have been granted orphan drug designation under the Orphan Drug Act by the FDA for two of our product candidates in DMD (including eteplirsen), AVI-7537 for the treatment of Ebola virus and AVI-7288 for the treatment of the Marburg virus. Upon approval from the FDA of an NDA, products granted orphan drug status are generally provided with seven years of marketing exclusivity in the U.S., meaning the FDA generally will not approve applications for other product candidates for the same orphan indication that contain the same active ingredient. Even if we are the first to obtain approval of an orphan product and are granted exclusivity in the United States, there are limited circumstances under which a later competitor product may be approved for the same indication during the seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, such as if the later product is shown to be clinically superior to our product or due to an inability to assure a sufficient quantity of the orphan drug.\nWe also have been granted orphan medicinal product designations in the E.U. for two of our product candidates in DMD (including eteplirsen). Product candidates granted orphan status in Europe can be provided with up to 10 years of marketing exclusivity, meaning that another application for marketing authorization of a later similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication will generally not be approved in Europe during that time period. Although we may have product candidates that may obtain orphan drug exclusivity in Europe, the orphan status and associated exclusivity period may be modified for several reasons, including a significant change to the orphan medicinal product designations or status criteria after market authorization of the orphan product (e.g., product profitability exceeds the criteria for orphan drug designation), problems with the production or supply of the orphan drug, or a competitor drug, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior than the initial orphan drug.\nWe are not guaranteed to receive or maintain orphan status for our current or future product candidates, and if our product candidates that are granted orphan status were to lose their status as orphan drugs or the marketing exclusivity provided for them in the United States or the E.U., our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. While orphan status for any of our products, if granted or maintained, would provide market exclusivity in the United States and the E.U. for the time periods specified above, we would not be able to exclude other companies from manufacturing and/or selling products using the same active ingredient for the same indication beyond the exclusivity period applicable to our product on the basis of orphan drug status. In addition, we cannot guarantee that another company will not receive approval to market a product candidate that is granted orphan drug status in the United States or the E.U. for a product candidate that has the same active ingredient or is a similar medicinal product for the same indication as any of our product candidates for which we plan to file an NDA or marketing authorization application (\u201cMAA\u201d). If that were to happen, any pending NDA or MAA for our product candidate for that indication may not be approved until the competing company\u2019s period of exclusivity has expired in the United States or the E.U., as applicable. Further, application of the orphan drug regulations in the United States and Europe is uncertain, and we cannot predict how the respective regulatory bodies will interpret and apply the regulations to our or our competitors\u2019 product candidates.\nEven if we receive regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates, it is possible that they may not become commercially viable products.\nEven if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the product may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare or third-party payers or the medical community which could limit commercialization of the product. Assuming that any of our product candidates receives the required regulatory approvals, commercial success will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to the following:\n\u00b7\ndemonstration and/or confirmation of clinical efficacy and safety and acceptance of the same by the medical community;\n\u00b7\ncost-effectiveness of the product;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of adequate reimbursement by third parties, including government payers such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations and private health insurers;\n\u00b7\nthe product\u2019s potential advantage over alternative or competitive treatment methods;\n\u00b7\nwhether the product can be manufactured in commercial quantities and at acceptable costs;\n\u00b7\nmarketing and distribution support for the product;\n\u00b7\nany exclusivities or patent rights applicable to the product;\n\u00b7\nthe market-size for the product which may be different than expected; and\n\u00b7\nour ability to achieve and sustain profitability, which may not occur if we are unable to develop and commercialize any of our product candidates, development is delayed or sales revenue from any product candidate that receives marketing approval is insufficient.\nIf there are significant delays in obtaining or we are unable to obtain or maintain required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates in a timely manner or at all, which would materially impair our ability to generate revenue and have a successful business.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, commercialization, marketing, selling and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by applicable local, regional and national regulatory authorities and regulations may differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In the United States, approvals and oversight from federal (e.g., FDA), state and other regulatory authorities are required for these activities. Sale and marketing of our product candidates in the United States or other countries is not permitted until we obtain the required approvals from the applicable regulatory authorities. Our ability to obtain the government or regulatory approvals required to commercialize any of our product candidates, including eteplirsen, on an accelerated approval (e.g., under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 (\u201cFDASIA\u201d)) or any other basis, in any jurisdiction, including in the United States, cannot be assured, may be significantly delayed or may never be achieved for various reasons including the following:\n\u00b7\nOur preclinical, clinical, Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (\u201cCMC\u201d) and other data and analyses from past, current and future studies for any of our product candidates may not be sufficient to meet regulatory requirements for submissions, advisory committee panels, filings or approvals. The FDA could disagree with our beliefs, interpretations and conclusions regarding data we submit in connection with an NDA submission, including the eteplirsen NDA, or other product candidates, and may delay, reject or refuse to file or approve any NDA submission we make or provide a complete response letter until we meet their additional requirements, if ever. In addition, an advisory committee could determine our data are insufficient to provide a positive recommendation for approval of any NDA we submit to the FDA. Even if we meet FDA requirements and an advisory committee votes to recommend approval of an NDA submission, the FDA could still deny approval of our product candidates based on their review of the data or other factors. Each of these risks all apply to our eteplirsen NDA which is the only NDA we have submitted to the FDA for review to date.\n\u00b7\nThe regulatory approval process for product candidates targeting orphan diseases, such as DMD, that use new technologies and processes, such as antisense oligonucleotide therapies, and novel endpoints, such as natural history data and dystrophin measures, is uncertain due to, among other factors, evolving interpretations of a new therapeutic class, the broad discretion of regulatory authorities, lack of precedent, varying levels of applicable expertise of regulators or their advisory committees, scientific developments, changes in the competitor landscape, shifting political priorities and changes in applicable laws, rules or regulations and interpretations of the same. We cannot be sure that any of our product candidates, including eteplirsen, will qualify for accelerated approval under FDASIA or any other expedited development, review and approval programs, or that, if a drug does qualify, that the product candidates will be approved, will be accepted as part of any such program or that the review time will be shorter than a standard review. As a result of uncertainty in the approval process, we may not be able to anticipate, prepare for or satisfy requests or requirements from regulatory authorities, including completing and submitting planned INDs and NDAs for our product candidates, in a timely manner, or at all. Examples of such requests or requirements could include, but are not limited to, conducting additional or redesigned trials and procedures (e.g., additional patient muscle biopsies and dystrophin analyses), repeating or completing additional analysis of our data, or providing additional supportive data. In addition, an advisory committee or regulators may disagree with our data analysis, interpretations and conclusions at any point in the approval process, which could negatively impact the review of our NDA or result in a decision by the Company not to proceed with development of a product candidate or an NDA submission for a product candidate based on feedback from regulators. For example, in reviewing the dystrophin data and analysis that we submitted for eteplirsen, the FDA previously expressed concerns with dystrophin as a surrogate endpoint and requested an independent assessment of dystrophin positive fibers measured in our eteplirsen Phase IIb study, which we provided. The FDA has also requested natural history data to better evaluate the ongoing clinical results of our eteplirsen 201/202 study, which we have also provided. Any material inconsistencies between our existing data and analysis and any new analyses and additional data we provide to the FDA, including the independent assessment of dystrophin positive fibers, safety data, natural history and data from a fourth biopsy that we have provided, could negatively impact the review of our eteplirsen NDA submission. While our studies demonstrate statistical significance, the FDA may not consider our six-minute walk test (\u201c6MWT\u201d) results, including our comparison of our 6MWT results to matched external natural history data, or, to the extent the FDA considers dystrophin a relevant biomarker, the dystrophin production observed in our studies, as demonstration of, or reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit. Additionally, the FDA may determine, after evaluating the totality of our data and analysis package for a product candidate, or receiving the vote of an advisory committee, that such package does not support an NDA approval.\n\u00b7\nWe may not have the resources required to meet regulatory requirements and successfully navigate what is generally a lengthy, expensive and extensive approval process for commercialization of drug product candidates. Any failure on our part to respond to these requests in a timely and satisfactory manner could significantly delay or negatively impact our placebo-controlled confirmatory study timelines and/or the development plans we have for the exon 53- and exon 45-skipping product candidates. Responding to requests from regulators and meeting requirements for clinical studies, submissions, filings, advisory committees and approvals may require substantial personnel, financial or other resources, which, as a small pre-commercial biopharmaceutical company, we may not be able to obtain in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our ability to respond to requests from regulatory authorities that involve our agents, third-party vendors and associates may be complicated by our own limitations and those of the parties we work with. For example, changes to CMC processes for the production of eteplirsen may require coordination with our third-party manufacturers, which may or may not be limited in their abilities to execute such regulatory requests. It may be difficult or impossible for us to conform to regulatory guidance or successfully execute our product development plans in response to regulatory guidance, including related to clinical trial design and the timing of regulatory decisions with respect to any NDA submissions.\nDue to the above factors, among others, our product candidates could take a significantly longer time to gain regulatory approval than we expect, or may never gain regulatory approval, which would delay or eliminate any potential commercialization or product revenue for us. Even if we are able to comply with all regulatory requests and requirements, the delays resulting from satisfying such requests and requirements, the cost of compliance, or the effect of regulatory decisions (e.g., limiting labeling and indications requested by us for a product candidate) may no longer make commercialization of a product candidate desirable for us from a business perspective, which could lead us to decide not to commercialize a product candidate.\nEven after approval and commercialization of a product candidate, we would remain subject to ongoing regulatory compliance and oversight to maintain our approval. Conducting our confirmatory studies could take years to complete, yield negative results or the FDA could determine that they do not provide the safety and efficacy requirements to maintain regulatory approval. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties or we may not be permitted to continue marketing our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and harm our competitive position in the market place.\nOur preclinical and clinical trials may fail to demonstrate acceptable levels of safety, efficacy, and quality of our product candidates, which could prevent or significantly delay their regulatory approval.\nTo obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to market and sell any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate, through extensive preclinical and clinical studies that the product candidate is safe and effective in humans. Ongoing and future preclinical and clinical trials of our product candidates may not show sufficient safety, efficacy or adequate quality to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals. Furthermore, success in preclinical and early clinical trials does not ensure that the subsequent trials we plan to conduct will be successful, nor does it predict final results of a confirmatory trial. If our study data do not consistently or sufficiently demonstrate the safety or efficacy of any of our product candidates, then the regulatory approvals for such product candidates could be significantly delayed as we work to meet approval requirements, or, if we are not able to meet these requirements, such approvals could be withheld. For example, in 2012, we completed Study 201, a U.S.-based Phase IIb 12-person clinical trial for eteplirsen at 30 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg. Following completion of this study, we initiated Study 202, an ongoing open label extension study with the same participants from Study 201. These trials were initiated, in part, to further demonstrate efficacy and safety, including the production of dystrophin, and explore and identify a more consistently effective dose that may be more appropriate for future clinical trials. While Studies 201 and 202 demonstrated dystrophin production based on the measurements taken at weeks 24 and 48, respectively, and 6MWT results reported for weeks 62, 74, 84, 96 and 120 supported stabilization of disease progression, we cannot provide assurances that data from the ongoing open label extension study will continue to be positive or consistent through the study periods or that the interpretation by regulators, such as the FDA, of the data we collect for our product candidates, including for eteplirsen, will be consistent with our interpretations. For example, on July 10, 2014, we announced that the 6MWT results for week 144 in Study 202 showed a change in decline from 5%, which was observed prior to 144 weeks, to approximately 8.5%. Additionally, on January 12, 2015, we announced results for week 168 in Study 202, which showed continued ambulation across all patients evaluable on the test, however patients showed a decline in distance walked on this measure since the week 144 time point. Further, on October 1, 2015 we announced additional clinical efficacy and safety data that demonstrated that (i) eteplirsen provided a statistically significant advantage of 151 meters in the ability of study participants to walk at three years versus an untreated external DMD control, (ii) eteplirsen-treated patients (n=12) experienced a slower rate of decline through week 192 versus untreated external DMD controls and (iii) the eteplirsen safety profile remained consistent with prior results. In January 2016, the FDA made public our eteplirsen Briefing Document Addendum (the \u201cJanuary 2016 Addendum\u201d), which disclosed that at four years, 10 out of 12 patients on eteplirsen remained ambulatory while 10 out of 13 untreated patients in the external control had lost ambulation (one patient in the external control was still ambulatory at year four, while two patients in the external control were missing data at four years), a statistically significant difference. In addition, the January 2016 Addendum disclosed a statistically significant advantage of 162 meters in the ability of study participants to walk (as measured by the 6MWT) at four years.\nIf we do not obtain the required approvals to initiate the confirmatory trial for eteplirsen using our exon 45- and 53-skipping product candidates, the data from the confirmatory studies for eteplirsen do not produce the safety and efficacy data required by the FDA for obtaining or maintaining marketing approval, or the FDA does not accept the results of our eteplirsen confirmatory studies as supporting evidence of efficacy, we may need to continue working with the FDA on the design and subsequent execution of any further studies or analysis we plan to conduct or that may be required to obtain and maintain approval of eteplirsen or our other DMD product candidates. Any significant delays or negative developments in the confirmatory studies for eteplirsen could delay or otherwise negatively impact our development plans for our follow-on DMD product candidates. For example, in October 2014, we received meeting minutes from a Type B pre-NDA meeting that took place in September 2014 in which the FDA provided updated guidance regarding the information to be provided as part of, or at the time of, our NDA submission for eteplirsen. The guidance stated that the FDA was requiring additional data as part of the NDA submission, including the results from an independent assessment of dystrophin images, the 168 week clinical data from Study 202, and additional safety data from new patients exposed to eteplirsen, specifying the minimum number of patients and minimum duration of exposure. Additionally, the guidance also required patient-level natural history data to be obtained by us from independent academic institutions and requested MRI data from a recent study conducted by an independent group. Although we continue to work to provide the FDA with the additional data and information requested, it may not support or result in a positive recommendation of an advisory committee or the approval of our eteplirsen NDA submission.\nWe currently rely on third parties in the manufacturing process to produce our product candidates and our dependence on these parties, including any inability on our part to accurately anticipate product demand and timely secure manufacturing capacity to meet actual clinical or commercial product demand may impair the advancement of our research and development programs and potential commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe currently do not have the internal ability to undertake the manufacturing process for our product candidates in the quantities needed to conduct our research and development programs, supply clinical trials or meet commercial demand. Therefore, we rely on and expect to continue relying on for the foreseeable future, a limited number of third parties to manufacture and supply materials (including raw materials and subunits), drug substance (\u201cAPI\u201d) and drug product, as well as to perform additional steps in the manufacturing process, such as the filling and labeling of vials and storage of our product candidates. There are a limited number of third parties with facilities and capabilities suited for the manufacturing process of our product candidates which creates a heightened risk that we may not be able to obtain materials and APIs in the quantity and purity that we require. Any interruption of the development or operation of those facilities due to, among other reasons, events such as order delays for equipment or materials, equipment malfunction, quality control and quality assurance issues, regulatory delays and possible negative effects of such delays on supply chains and expected timelines for product availability, production yield issues, shortages of qualified personnel, discontinuation of a facility or business or failure or damage to a facility by natural disasters, could result in the cancellation of shipments, loss of product in the manufacturing process or a shortfall in available product candidates or materials.\nIf these third parties were to cease providing quality manufacturing and related services to us, and we are not able to engage appropriate replacements in a timely manner, our ability to have our product candidates manufactured in sufficient quality and quantity required for planned preclinical testing, clinical trials and potential commercial use would be adversely affected.\nSarepta, through its third party manufacturers, has produced or is in the process of producing clinical and commercial supply, including for eteplirsen, based on its current understanding of market demands and planned clinical studies. In light of the limited number of third parties with the expertise to produce our product candidates, the lead time needed to manufacture them, and the availability of underlying materials, we may not be able to, in a timely manner or at all, establish or maintain sufficient commercial manufacturing arrangements on the commercially reasonable terms necessary to provide adequate supply of our product candidates to meet demands that exceed our clinical or commercial assumptions. Further, we may not be able to obtain the significant financial capital that may be required in connection with such arrangements. Even after successfully engaging third parties to execute the manufacturing process for our product candidates, such parties may not comply with the terms and timelines they have agreed to for various reasons, some of which may be out of their or our control, which could impact our ability to execute our business plans on expected or required timelines in connection with the regulatory approval process and potential commercialization. We may also be required to enter into long-term manufacturing agreements that contain exclusivity provisions and/or substantial termination penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business prior to and after commercialization of any of our product candidates.\nThe third parties we use in the manufacturing process for our product candidates may fail to comply with cGMP regulations.\nOur contract manufacturers are required to produce our materials, APIs and drug products under current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations (\u201ccGMP\u201d). We and our contract manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign authorities to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign requirements. We do not have control over a third-party manufacturer\u2019s compliance with these regulations and requirements. In addition, changes in cGMP could negatively impact the ability of our contract manufacturers to complete the manufacturing process of our product candidates in a compliant manner on the schedule we require for clinical trials or for potential\ncommercial use. The failure to achieve and maintain high quality compliance, including failure to detect or control anticipated or unanticipated manufacturing errors, could result in patient injury or death or product recalls. Any difficulties or delays in our contractors\u2019 manufacturing and supply of product candidates, or any failure of our contractors to maintain compliance with the applicable regulations and requirements could increase our costs, make us postpone or cancel clinical trials, prevent or delay regulatory approvals by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign authorities, prevent the import and/or export of our products, cause us to lose revenue, result in the termination of the development of a product candidate, or have our product candidates recalled or withdrawn from use.\nWe may not be able to successfully scale up manufacturing of our product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity or within sufficient timelines, or be able to secure ownership of intellectual property rights developed in this process, which could delay or prevent us from developing or commercializing our product candidates.\nAs we prepare for larger and later stage clinical trials for our product candidates and the potential commercialization of eteplirsen, we are working to increase future manufacturing capacity and scale up production of some of the components of our drug products. In 2016, our focus remains on (i) achieving larger-scale manufacturing capacity for eteplirsen throughout the manufacturing supply chain and (ii) continuing to increase material and API production capacity to provide the anticipated amounts of drug product needed for our planned studies for our product candidates. We may not be able to successfully increase manufacturing capacity or scale up the production of materials, APIs and drug products, whether in collaboration with third-party manufacturers or on our own, in a manner that is safe, compliant with cGMP conditions or other applicable legal or regulatory requirements or is cost-effective, or in a time frame required to meet our timelines for clinical trials, potential commercialization and other business plans, or at all. cGMP and other quality issues may arise during our efforts to increase manufacturing capacity and scale up production with our current or any new contract manufacturers. These issues may arise in connection with the underlying materials, the inherent properties of a product candidate itself or the product candidate in combination with other components added during the manufacturing and packaging process or during shipping and storage of the APIs or finished drug product. In addition, in order to release product and demonstrate stability of product candidates for use in late stage clinical trials (and any subsequent drug products for commercial use), our analytical methods must be validated in accordance with regulatory guidelines. We may not be able to successfully validate, or maintain validation of, our analytical methods or demonstrate adequate purity, stability or comparability of the product candidates in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all. If we are unable to successfully validate our analytical methods or to demonstrate adequate purity, stability or comparability, the development of our product candidates and regulatory approval or commercial launch for any resulting drug products may be delayed, which could significantly harm our business.\nDuring work with our third-party manufacturers to increase manufacturing capacity and scale up production, it is possible that they could make improvements in the manufacturing and scale-up processes for our product candidates. We may not own or be able to secure ownership of such improvements or may have to share the intellectual property rights to those improvements. Additionally, it is possible that we will need additional processes, technologies and validation studies, which could be costly and which we may not be able to develop or acquire from third parties. Any failure to secure the intellectual rights required for the manufacturing process needed for large-scale clinical trials or commercialization of our product candidates could cause significant delays in our business plans or prevent commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe are winding down our expired U.S. government contract, and further development of our Ebola and Marburg product candidates may be limited by our ability to obtain additional funding for these programs and by the intellectual property and other rights retained by the U.S. government.\nWe have historically relied on U.S. government contracts and awards to fund and support certain development programs, including our Ebola and Marburg programs. The July 2010 DoD contract providing funds for our Marburg program expired in July 2014, and the Ebola portion of the contract was previously terminated by the DoD in 2012 for convenience of the DoD. We are currently involved in contract wind-down activities and may be subject to additional government audits prior to collecting final cost reimbursements and fees owed by the government. If we are not able to complete such audits or other government requirements successfully, then the government may withhold some or all of the currently outstanding amounts owed to us. We may explore and evaluate options to continue advancing the development of our Ebola and Marburg product candidates, which may or may not include funding through U.S. government programs. As a result of government budgetary cuts, appropriations and sequestration, among other reasons, the viability of the government and its agencies as a partner for further development of our Ebola and Marburg programs, or other programs, is uncertain. The options for us to further develop product candidates that were previously developed under contracts with the U.S. government with third parties may be limited or difficult in certain respects given that, after termination or expiration of a U.S. government contract, the government has broad license rights in intellectual property developed under such contract. Therefore, the U.S. government may have the right to develop all or some parts of product candidates we have developed under a U.S. government contract after such contract has terminated or expired.\nWe may not be able to successfully conduct clinical trials due to various process-related factors which could negatively impact our business plans.\nThe successful start and completion of any of our clinical trials within time frames consistent with our business plans is dependent on various factors, which include, but are not limited to, our ability to:\n\u00b7\nrecruit and retain employees, consultants or contractors with the required level of expertise;\n\u00b7\nrecruit and retain sufficient patients needed to conduct a clinical trial;\no\nparticipant enrollment and retention is a function of many factors, including the size of the relevant population, the proximity of participants to clinical sites, activities of patient advocacy groups, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the existence of competing clinical trials, the availability of alternative or new treatments, side effects from the therapy, lack of efficacy, personal issues and ease of participation;\n\u00b7\ntimely and effectively contract with (under reasonable terms), manage and work with investigators, institutions, hospitals and the contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) involved in the clinical trial;\n\u00b7\nnegotiate contracts and other related documents with clinical trial parties and IRBs, such as informed consents, CRO agreements and site agreements, which can be subject to extensive negotiations that could cause significant delays in the clinical trial process. In addition, terms may vary significantly among different trial sites and CROs and may subject the Company to various risks;\n\u00b7\nensure adherence to trial designs and protocols agreed upon and approved by regulatory authorities and applicable legal and regulatory guidelines;\n\u00b7\nmanage or resolve unforeseen adverse side effects during a clinical trial;\n\u00b7\nconduct the clinical trials in a cost effective manner, including managing foreign currency risk in clinical trials conducted in foreign jurisdictions and cost increases due to unforeseen or unexpected complications such as enrollment delays, or needing to outsource certain Company functions during the clinical trial; and\n\u00b7\nexecute clinical trial designs and protocols approved by regulatory authorities without deficiencies.\nIf we are not able to manage the clinical trial process successfully, our business plans could be delayed or be rendered unfeasible for us to execute within our planned or required time frames, or at all.\nWe have incurred operating losses since our inception and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe incurred an operating loss of $220.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our accumulated deficit was $899.1 million as of December 31, 2015. Substantially all of our revenue to date has been derived from research and development contracts with the DoD, the last of which expired in July 2014. We have not yet generated any revenue from product sales and have generally incurred expenses related to research and development of our technology and product candidates, from general and administrative expenses that we have incurred while building our business infrastructure. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:\n\u00b7\ncontinue our research, preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nrespond to and satisfy requests and requirements from regulatory authorities in connection with development and potential approval of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\ninitiate additional clinical trials for our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nseek marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nacquire or in-license other product candidates;\n\u00b7\nestablish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n\u00b7\nmaintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u00b7\nincrease manufacturing capabilities including capital expenditures related to our real estate facilities and entering into manufacturing agreements;\n\u00b7\nhire additional clinical, quality control and scientific personnel; and\n\u00b7\nadd operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts.\nOur ability to achieve and maintain profitability depends on various factors including our ability to raise additional capital, partner with third parties for one or more of our programs, complete development of our product candidates, obtain regulatory approvals and market our approved products, if any. It is uncertain when, if ever, we will become profitable and if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of the Company and could impair our ability to raise capital, maintain our research and development efforts, expand our business or continue our operations.\nIf the FDA does not approve our eteplirsen NDA by the currently planned PDUFA date, or at all, our business may be negatively impacted and we may suffer financial losses in connection with winding down and terminating contracts, manufacturing commitments and employees hired in connection with our current and planned activities in preparation for a potential commercial launch.\nGiven the potential commercialization timelines, we have commenced certain pre-launch and commercialization investments and activities including, but not limited to, negotiating and entering into supply and other commercial agreements, scaling up manufacturing and hiring certain positions needed for pre-launch and commercial activities and operations. If the FDA delays or does not provide approval for our eteplirsen NDA by the currently planned PDUFA date of May 26, 2016, or at all, or we need to delay or discontinue our development and commercialization plans for eteplirsen for other reasons, our business and the development of our follow-on DMD product candidates may be negatively impacted and we may incur financial losses in connection with delaying, winding down or terminating the investments, contracts and commitments we enter into for the purpose of positioning ourselves for a commercial launch of eteplirsen.\nWe will need additional funds to conduct our planned research, development and manufacturing efforts. If we fail to attract significant capital on acceptable terms or fail to enter into strategic relationships, we may be unable to continue to develop our product candidates.\nWe will likely require additional capital from time to time in the future in order to continue the development of product candidates in our pipeline and to expand our product portfolio. The actual amount of funds that we may need will be determined by many factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include the success of our research and development efforts, the status of our preclinical and clinical testing, costs and timing relating to securing regulatory approvals and obtaining patent rights, regulatory changes, competitive and technological developments in the market and any commercialization expenses related to any product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. An unforeseen change in these factors, or others, might increase our need for additional capital.\nWe would expect to seek additional financing from the sale and issuance of equity or equity-linked or debt securities, and we cannot predict that financing will be available when and as we need financing or that, if available, the financing terms will be commercially reasonable. In addition, if the FDA delays or ultimately denies approval of our eteplirsen NDA, raising additional funds may be difficult. If we are unable to obtain additional financing when and if we require it or on commercially reasonable terms, this would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf we are able to consummate such financings, the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected and/or the terms of such financings may adversely affect the interests of our existing stockholders. To the extent we issue additional equity securities or convertible securities, our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution in their economic and voting rights. For example, on October 9, 2015, we sold 3,250,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $39.00 per share. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nFurther, we may also enter into relationships with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies to perform research and development with respect to our technologies, research programs, conduct clinical trials or market our product candidates. Other than preclinical collaborations with academic or research institutions and government entities for the development of additional exon-skipping product candidates for the treatment of DMD and clinical collaboration for a product candidate for the treatment of influenza, we currently do not have a strategic relationship with a third party to perform research or development using our technologies or assist us in funding the continued development and commercialization of any of our programs or product candidates. If we were to have such a strategic relationship, such third party may require us to issue equity to such third party, relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nOur indebtedness resulting from our credit and security agreement with MidCap Financial could adversely affect our financial condition or restrict our future operations.\nOn June 26, 2015, the Company entered into a credit and security agreement with MidCap Financial that provides a senior secured term loan of $20.0 million, which may be increased by an additional $20.0 million upon the acceptance by the FDA of the NDA for eteplirsen. This indebtedness could have important consequences, including:\n\u00b7\nrequiring the Company to maintain pledged cash in favor of MidCap Financial equal to not less than the lesser of the outstanding term loans or (a) $15.0 million prior to the increase in the term loan by an additional $20.0 million and (b) $30.0 million thereafter;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u00b7\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt or competitors with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy and other purposes; and\n\u00b7\nresulting in an acceleration of the maturity of such term loans upon the occurrence of a material adverse change or another default under the credit and security agreement.\nAny of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our business and our ability to service our indebtedness would increase.\nThe estimates and judgments we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our consolidated financial statements could prove inaccurate.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Such estimates and judgments include those related to revenue recognition, accrued expenses, assumptions in the valuation of stock-based compensation and accounting for and valuation of liability classified warrants. We base our estimates on historical experience, facts and circumstances known to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We cannot provide assurances, however, that our estimates, or the assumptions underlying them, will not change over time or otherwise prove inaccurate. If this is the case, we may be required to restate our consolidated financial statements, which could in turn subject us to securities class action litigation. Defending against such potential litigation relating to a restatement of our consolidated financial statements would be expensive and would require significant attention and resources of our management. Moreover, our insurance to cover our obligations with respect to the ultimate resolution of any such litigation may be inadequate. As a result of these factors, any such potential litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cause our stock price to decline, which could in turn subject us to securities class action litigation.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be limited as a result of future transactions involving our common stock.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a corporation that undergoes an \u2018\u2018ownership change\u2019\u2019 is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses and certain other tax assets to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period, which is generally three years. An ownership change could limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for taxable years including or following such \u201cownership change.\u201d Limitations imposed on the ability to use net operating losses and tax credits to offset future taxable income could require us to pay U.S. federal income taxes earlier than we estimated than would have otherwise been required if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such net operating losses and tax credits to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such net operating losses and tax credits and potentially adversely affecting our financial position. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.\nWe rely on third parties to provide services in connection with our preclinical and clinical development programs. The inadequate performance by or loss of any of these service providers could affect our product candidate development.\nSeveral third parties provide services in connection with our preclinical and clinical development programs, including in vitro and in vivo studies, assay and reagent development, immunohistochemistry, toxicology, pharmacokinetics, clinical assessments, data\nmonitoring and management, statistical analysis and other outsourced activities. If these service providers do not adequately perform the services for which we have contracted or cease to continue operations and we are not able to quickly find a replacement provider or we lose information or items associated with our product candidates, our development programs may be delayed.\nIf we fail to retain our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, our future growth and our ability to compete would suffer.\nWe are highly dependent on the efforts and abilities of the principal members of our senior management. Additionally, we have scientific personnel with significant and unique expertise in RNA-targeted therapeutics and related technologies. The loss of the services of any one of the principal members of our managerial team or staff may prevent us from achieving our business objectives.\nOur former CEO and President resigned on March 31, 2015 and we have appointed an interim CEO. No assurance can be made about the impact that this change in management will have on the Company and its business plans (including our regulatory and clinical plans and relationships) nor as to when we will hire a permanent CEO. The existing management team is actively managing the business in accordance with a business strategy approved by the board of directors.\nThe competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology field is intense, and our future success depends upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate such personnel. In order to develop and commercialize our products successfully, we will be required to retain key management and scientific employees. In certain instances, we may also need to expand or replace our workforce and our management ranks. In addition, we rely on certain consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in the formulation and advancement of our research and development programs. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by other entities or have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with third parties that limit their availability to us, or both. If we are unable to attract, assimilate or retain such key personnel, our ability to advance our programs would be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to effectively manage our growth, execute our business strategy and implement compliance controls and systems, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Any failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect investor confidence in our reported financial information.\nWe anticipate continued growth in our business operations due, in part, to advancing our product candidates. This future growth could create a strain on our organizational, administrative and operational infrastructure. Our ability to manage our growth properly and maintain compliance with all applicable rules and regulations will require us to continue to improve our operational, legal, financial and management controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures. We may not be able to build the management and human resources and infrastructure necessary to support the growth of our business. The time and resources required to implement systems and infrastructure that may be needed to support our growth is uncertain, and failure to complete implementation in a timely and efficient manner could adversely affect our operations.\nWe may engage in future acquisitions or collaborations with other entities that increase our capital requirements, dilute our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks.\nWe actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis, including licensing or acquiring complementary products, technologies or businesses. Potential acquisitions or collaborations with other entities may entail numerous risks, including increased operating expenses and cash requirements, assimilation of operations and products, retention of key employees, diversion of our management\u2019s attention and uncertainties in our ability to maintain key business relationships of the acquired entities. In addition, if we undertake acquisitions, we may issue dilutive securities, assume or incur debt obligations, incur large one-time expenses and acquire intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense.\nOur success, competitive position and future revenue, if any, depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technologies and product candidates, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties.\nWe currently hold various issued patents and exclusive rights to issued patents and own and have licenses to various patent applications, in each case in the United States as well as other countries. We anticipate filing additional patent applications both in the United States and in other countries. The patent process, however, is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining and defending patents or in avoiding infringement of the rights of others. Even when our patent claims are allowed, the claims may not issue, or in the event of issuance, may not be sufficient to protect the technology owned by or licensed to us or our collaborators. Even if our patents and patent applications do provide our product candidates and platform technology with a basis for exclusivity, we and our collaborators may not be able to develop or commercialize such product candidates or platform technology due to patent positions held by one or more third parties.\nWe may not be able to obtain and maintain patent protection for our product candidates necessary to prevent competitors from commercializing competing product candidates. Our patent rights might be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or otherwise not provide any competitive advantage, and we might not be successful in challenging the patent rights of our competitors through litigation or administrative proceedings. For example, in July 2014, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (the \u201cPTAB\u201d) of the USPTO declared patent interferences between certain patents held by Sarepta (under license from the University of Western Australia, \u201cUWA\u201d) and patent applications held by BioMarin (under license from Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden, \u201cAZL\u201d) related to exon 51 and exon 53 skipping therapies designed to treat DMD. In particular, the PTAB declared Interference No. 106,008, which identifies Sarepta\u2019s/UWA\u2019s U.S. Patent Nos. 7,807,816 and 7,960,541, both covering eteplirsen, as interfering with BioMarin\u2019s/AZL\u2019s U.S. Application No. 13/550,210. The PTAB also declared Interference No. 106,007, which identifies Sarepta\u2019s/UWA\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 8,455,636, covering SRP-4053, as interfering with BioMarin\u2019s/AZL\u2019s U.S. Application No. 11/233,495. In September 2014, the PTAB declared a third patent interference relating to certain methods concerning the exon 51 skipping therapies that are the subject of Interference No. 106,008. In particular, the PTAB declared Interference No. 106,013, which identifies Sarepta\u2019s/UWA\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 8,486,907, which covers certain methods of using eteplirsen, as interfering with BioMarin\u2019s/AZL\u2019s U.S. Application No. 14/198,992. In addition, in a September 2014 Order in Interference No. 106,007, the PTAB authorized us to file a motion with the PTAB, which we filed in November 2014, requesting the declaration of a fourth interference relating to certain methods concerning the exon 53 skipping therapies that are the subject of Interference No. 106,007, including SRP-4053, and between Sarepta\u2019s/UWA\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 8,455,636 and BioMarin\u2019s/AZL\u2019s U.S. Application No. 14/248,279. On September 29, 2015, we received notice that the PTAB had issued a decision in Interference No. 106,013 that resulted in a judgment against Sarepta and an order for the cancellation of Sarepta\u2019s/UWA\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 8,486,907 that covers certain methods of using eteplirsen thereby leaving open the possibility of BioMarin\u2019s/AZL\u2019s competing U.S. Application No. 14/198,992 to issue and, if so, potentially provide a basis for BioMarin to allege that our product candidate, eteplirsen, infringes a patent granting from this application. We filed a Request for Rehearing that requests the PTAB to continue this interference, and the PTAB denied our Request on December 29, 2015. We intend to appeal this decision to an appropriate appeals court. We cannot make any assurances about the outcome of the two remaining proceedings (Interference No. 106,007 and Interference No. 106,008) or appeals of any of these three interferences. Any additional adverse rulings, which, in the case of Interference No. 106,007 and Interference No. 106,008 could come at any time and, if negative, could adversely affect our business and result in a decline in our stock price. If final resolution of the interferences and related appeals are not in our favor, then the Sarepta/UWA patents involved in these interferences and any other Sarepta/UWA patents or applications also found to be interfering may be invalidated, and as a result, we may not have any patent-based exclusivity available for our product candidates, which may have a material negative impact on our business plans. In addition, if final resolution of the interferences or related appeals are not in our favor, the USPTO may issue the BioMarin/AZL patent applications resulting in the grant of one or more patents that may provide a basis for BioMarin to allege that our product candidates, eteplirsen and/or SRP-4053, infringe such patents. In addition, these interferences, appeals and any subsequent litigation may require significant financial resources that we may have planned to spend on other Company objectives, resulting in delays or other negative impacts on such other objectives. In addition, BioMarin may continue to evaluate other opportunities to challenge our intellectual property rights or seek to broaden their patent positions in an attempt to cover our product candidates in the United States and in other jurisdictions. We are also aware of certain pending and granted claims that are held by BioMarin in Japan, Europe and certain other countries that may provide the basis for BioMarin or other parties to assert that eteplirsen infringes on such claims. Because we have not yet initiated an invalidation proceeding in these countries, the outcome and timing of any such proceeding cannot be predicted or determined as of the date of this report.\nAs a matter of public policy, there might be significant pressure on governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection or impose compulsory licenses for disease treatments that prove successful. Additionally, jurisdictions other than the United States might have less restrictive patent laws than the United States, giving foreign competitors the ability to exploit these laws to create, develop and market competing products. The USPTO and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges. Accordingly, even if we or our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents might be substantially narrower than anticipated.\nOn September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted, and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO has issued regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, but many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act have only recently become effective. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. For instance, a third party may petition the PTAB seeking to challenge the validity of some or all of the claims in any of our patents through an Inter Partes Review (\u201cIPR\u201d) or other post-grant proceeding. Should the PTAB institute an IPR (or other) proceeding and decide that some or all of the claims in the challenged patent are invalid, such a decision, if upheld on appeal, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe full impact of several recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions relating to patent law is not yet known. For example, on March 20, 2012, in Mayo Collaborative Services, DBA Mayo Medical Laboratories, et al. v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., the Court\nheld that several claims drawn to measuring drug metabolite levels from patient samples and correlating them to drug doses were not patentable subject matter. The decision appears to impact diagnostics patents that merely apply a law of nature via a series of routine steps and it has created uncertainty around the ability to patent certain biomarker-related method claims. Additionally, on June 13, 2013, in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., the Court held that claims to isolated genomic DNA are not patentable, but claims to complementary DNA molecules were held to be valid. The effect of the decision on patents for other isolated natural products is uncertain and, as with the Leahy-Smith Act, these decisions could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur business prospects will be impaired if third parties successfully assert that our product candidates or technologies infringe proprietary rights of such third parties.\nOur competitors may make significant investments in competing technologies, and might have or obtain patents that limit, interfere with or eliminate our ability to make, use and sell our product candidates in important commercial markets.\nIf our product candidates or technologies infringe enforceable proprietary rights of others, we could incur substantial costs and may have to:\n\u00b7\nobtain rights or licenses from others, which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all;\n\u00b7\nabandon development of an infringing product candidate;\n\u00b7\nredesign product candidates or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u00b7\npay damages; and/or\n\u00b7\ndefend litigation or administrative proceedings which might be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of financial and management resources.\nAny of these events could substantially harm our potential earnings, financial condition and operations. BioMarin, which is developing competitive pipeline products, has rights to patent claims that, absent a license, may preclude us from commercializing eteplirsen in several jurisdictions. BioMarin has rights to European Patent No. EP 1619249, for example. We opposed this patent in the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office (\u201cEPO\u201d), and the Opposition Division maintained certain claims of this patent relating to the treatment of DMD by skipping dystrophin exons 51 and 46, which may provide a basis to maintain that commercialization of eteplirsen in a European country where BioMarin has a patent corresponding to EP 1619249 would infringe on such patent. Both we and BioMarin have appealed the Opposition Division decision, submitted briefs in support of our respective positions and have also submitted responses to each other\u2019s briefs. BioMarin filed arguments with the EPO in response to Sarepta\u2019s previously filed briefs. The Opposition Division decision, if maintained at the appeals level, could have a substantial negative effect on our business and leaves open the possibility that BioMarin or other parties that have rights to such patent could assert that our product candidate, eteplirsen, infringes on such patent in a relevant European country. The timing and outcome of the appeal cannot be predicted or determined as of the date of this report. If as part of any appeal before the European Patent Office we are unsuccessful in invalidating BioMarin\u2019s claims that were maintained by the Opposition Division or if claims previously invalidated by the Opposition Division are restored on appeal, our ability to commercialize both eteplirsen and other therapeutic candidates could be materially impaired. Moreover, our ability to commercialize eteplirsen in a European country where BioMarin has a patent related to EP 1619249 while the appeal process remains ongoing before the European Patent Office Board of Appeals could be materially impaired. In addition, we are aware of various divisional applications relating to EP 1619249 that are being pursued by BioMarin, which are pending and in some cases are proceeding to grant. Should any patents grant from these applications, our ability to commercialize eteplirsen or our other therapeutic candidates, such as SRP-4045 and SRP-4053, could be materially impaired.\nWe are also aware of existing patent claims BioMarin is pursuing in the United States, including those involved in the interferences declared by the USPTO in July 2014 and September 2014 and discussed in these risk factors, and others that it has or is pursuing in other countries, that where granted may provide the basis for BioMarin or other parties to assert that commercialization of eteplirsen and certain other of our product candidates would infringe on such claims.\nThe DMD patent landscape is continually evolving and multiple parties, including both commercial entities and academic institutions, may have rights to claims or may be pursuing additional claims that could provide these parties a basis to assert that our product candidates infringe on the intellectual property rights of such parties. Similarly, we may be able to assert that certain activities engaged in by these parties infringe on our current or future patent rights. There has been, and we believe that there will continue to be, significant litigation in the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We also cannot be certain that other third parties will not assert patent infringement in the future with respect to any of our development programs.\nWe face intense competition and rapid technological change, which may result in other companies discovering, developing or commercializing competitive products.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change. We are aware of many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are actively engaged in research and development in areas related to antisense technology and other RNA technologies, or that are developing alternative approaches to or therapeutics for the disease indications on which we are focused. Some of these competitors are developing or testing product candidates that now, or may in the future, compete directly with our product candidates. For example, we believe that companies including Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), Roche Innovation Center Copenhagen (formerly Santaris Pharma A/S) and Nippon Shinyaku Co. Ltd. share a focus on RNA-targeted drug discovery and development. Competitors with respect to our exon-skipping DMD program, or eteplirsen, include BioMarin (which acquired Prosensa), Nippon Shinyaku, Daiichi Sankyo and Shire plc; and other companies such as PTC Therapeutics and Summit plc have also been working on DMD programs. Additionally, several companies have entered into collaborations or other agreements for the development of product candidates, including mRNA, gene (CRIPSR and AAV, among others) and small molecule therapies that are potential competitors for therapies being developed in the muscular dystrophy, neuromuscular and rare disease space, including, but not limited to, Pfizer, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb, Biogen Idec, Inc., Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sanofi, Eli Lilly, Alnylam, Moderna Therapeutics, Inc., Summit plc, Akashi, Catabasis, and Oxford University. Although BioMarin received a complete response letter for KyndrisaTM (drisapersen) for the treatment of DMD amenable to exon 51 skipping on January 14, 2016, BioMarin continues to be a competitor for us on the development of DMD exon-skipping product candidates. BioMarin announced that its ongoing Kyndrisa extension studies will continue, as will the ongoing clinical trials for other exon-skipping oligonucleotides, BMN 044, BMN 045 and BMN 053, while BioMarin is exploring next steps for this application. If BioMarin is successful in obtaining regulatory approval for any of its exon-skipping product candidates, it may limit our ability to gain or keep market share in the DMD space or other diseases targeted by our exon-skipping platform and product candidate pipeline.\nIt is possible that our competitors will succeed in developing technologies that limit the market size for our product candidates, impact the regulatory approval process for our product candidates that are more effective than our product candidates or that would render our technology obsolete or noncompetitive. Our competitors, including BioMarin, may, among other things:\n\u00b7\ndevelop safer or more effective products;\n\u00b7\nimplement more effective approaches to sales and marketing;\n\u00b7\ndevelop less costly products;\n\u00b7\nobtain regulatory approval more quickly;\n\u00b7\nhave access to more manufacturing capacity;\n\u00b7\ndevelop products that are more convenient and easier to administer;\n\u00b7\nform more advantageous strategic alliances; or\n\u00b7\nestablish superior intellectual property positions.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims and our insurance may not be adequate to cover damages.\nWe currently have no products that have been approved for commercial sale; however, the current and future use of our product candidates by us and our collaborators in clinical trials, expanded access programs, the sale of any products in the future, or the use of our products under emergency use vehicles may expose us to liability claims inherent to the manufacture, clinical testing, marketing and sale of medical products. These claims might be made directly by consumers or healthcare providers or indirectly by pharmaceutical companies, our collaborators or others selling such products. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, we may experience financial losses in the future due to such product liability claims. We have obtained limited general commercial liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates. However, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against all losses. If a successful product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities, our assets may not be sufficient to cover such claims and our business operations could be impaired.\nOur operations involve the use of hazardous materials, and we must comply with environmental laws, which can be expensive, and may affect our business and operating results.\nOur research and development activities involve the use of hazardous materials, including organic and inorganic solvents and reagents. Accordingly, we are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling, manufacturing, exposure to and disposal of these hazardous materials. In addition, we are subject to environmental, health and\nworkplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of bio-hazardous materials. Although we believe that our activities conform in all material respects with such environmental laws, there can be no assurance that violations of these laws will not occur in the future as a result of human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes. Liability under environmental, health and safety laws can be joint and several and without regard to fault or negligence. The failure to comply with past, present or future laws could result in the imposition of substantial fines and penalties, remediation costs, property damage and personal injury claims, loss of permits or a cessation of operations, and any of these events could harm our business and financial condition. We expect that our operations will be affected by other new environmental, health and workplace safety laws on an ongoing basis, and although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any such new laws, they may impose greater compliance costs or result in increased risks or penalties, which could harm our business.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cyber security incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of third parties with which we contract are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. System failures, accidents or security breaches could cause interruptions in our operations, and could result in a material disruption of our clinical activities and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. The loss of clinical trial data could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur a liability and our research and development programs and the development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nWe may incur substantial costs in connection with litigation and other disputes.\nIn the ordinary course of business we may, and in some cases have, become involved in lawsuits and other disputes such as securities claims, intellectual property challenges, including interferences declared by the USPTO, and employee matters. It is possible that we may not prevail in claims made against us in such disputes even after expending significant amounts of money and company resources in defending our positions in such lawsuits and disputes. The outcome of such lawsuits and disputes is inherently uncertain and may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is volatile and may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control.\nThe market prices for and trading volumes of securities of biotechnology companies, including our securities, has historically been volatile. Our stock has had significant swings in trading prices, in particular in connection with our public communications regarding feedback received from regulatory authorities. For example, over the last twelve months, our stock has increased as much as 60% in a single day or decreased as much as 55% in a single day. We expect that our stock could have a material swing in its trading price in connection with competitor developments, any advisory committee meeting/recommendation or FDA decision relating to our eteplirsen NDA, including a decline in trading price if research analysts, investors or others who follow us view the results of any developments related to these events as negative for Sarepta. The market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u00b7\ndiscussions at, the outcome of and other matters related to the advisory committee meeting for eteplirsen;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of our submissions to regulatory authorities and regulatory decisions and developments including any decision by the FDA regarding our NDA for eteplirsen;\n\u00b7\npositive or negative clinical trial results or regulatory interpretations of data collected in clinical trials conducted by us, our strategic partners, our competitors or other companies with investigational drugs targeting the same, similar or related diseases to those targeted by our product candidates;\n\u00b7\ndelays in beginning and completing preclinical and clinical studies for potential product candidates;\n\u00b7\ndelays in entering or failing to enter into strategic relationships with respect to development and/or commercialization of our product candidates or entry into strategic relationships on terms that are not deemed to be favorable to our Company;\n\u00b7\ntechnological innovations, product development or commercial product introductions by ourselves or competitors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in applicable government regulations or regulatory requirements in the approval process;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments concerning proprietary rights, including patents and patent litigation matters, such as developments in the interferences declared by the USPTO, including in the near term any outcomes of ongoing interference proceedings and over the longer term the outcomes from any related appeals;\n\u00b7\npublic concern relating to the commercial value, efficacy or safety of any of our products;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain funds, through the issuance of equity or equity linked securities or incurrence of debt, or other corporate transactions;\n\u00b7\ncomments by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments in litigation such as the stockholder lawsuits against us;\n\u00b7\nchanges in senior management such as the resignation of our former CEO and appointment of an interim CEO in 2015; or\n\u00b7\ngeneral market conditions in our industry or in the economy as a whole.\nBroad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of a company\u2019s stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law might deter acquisition bids for us that might be considered favorable and prevent or frustrate any attempt to replace or remove the then-current management and board of directors.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or effect a change in our board of directors and management. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\nwhen the board is comprised of six or more directors, classification of our board of directors into two classes, with one class elected each year;\n\u00b7\ndirectors may only be removed for cause by the affirmative vote of majority of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of voting stock;\n\u00b7\nprohibition of cumulative voting of shares in the election of directors;\n\u00b7\nright of the board of directors to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death, disqualification or removal of a director;\n\u00b7\nexpress authorization of the board of directors to make, alter or repeal our bylaws;\n\u00b7\nprohibition on stockholder action by written consent;\n\u00b7\nadvance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms and rights of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, including rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock; and\n\u00b7\na super-majority (66 2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock are required to amend, rescind, alter or repeal our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws and in the Delaware General Corporation Law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors.\nWe expect our operating results to fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past, and we believe they will continue to do so in the future. Our operating results may fluctuate due to the variable nature of our revenue and research and development expenses. Likewise, our research and development expenses may experience fluctuations as a result of the timing and magnitude of expenditures incurred in\nsupport of our DMD and other proprietary drug development programs. In one or more future periods, our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nA significant number of shares of our common stock are issuable pursuant to outstanding stock awards, and we expect to issue additional stock awards and shares of common stock in the future. Exercise of these awards and sales of shares will dilute the interests of existing security holders and may depress the price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2015, there were approximately 45.6 million shares of common stock outstanding and outstanding awards to purchase 6.8 million shares of common stock under various incentive stock plans. Additionally, as of December 31, 2015, there were 1.8 million shares of common stock available for future issuance under our Amended and Restated 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, 0.1 million shares of common stock available for issuance under our 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and 1.0 million shares of common stock available for issuance under our 2014 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan. We may issue additional common stock and warrants from time to time to finance our operations. We may also issue additional shares to fund potential acquisitions or in connection with additional stock options or other equity awards granted to our employees, officers, directors and consultants under our Amended and Restated 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, our 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan or our 2014 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or warrants to purchase common stock and the perception that such issuances may occur or exercise of outstanding warrants or options may have a dilutive impact on other stockholders and could have a material negative effect on the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 85002, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "SRPT"}
