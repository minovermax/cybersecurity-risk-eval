{"cik": "276209", "company": "CONNECTICUT WATER SERVICE INC / CT", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or anticipated future results. For a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, see the discussion in \u201cForward Looking Information\u201d in Item 7 below - \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nBecause we incur significant capital expenditures annually, we depend on the rates we charge our customers, which are subject to regulation.\nThe water utility business is capital intensive. On an annual basis, we spend significant sums for additions to or replacement of property, plant and equipment. Our ability to maintain and meet our financial objectives is dependent upon the rates we charge our customers. These rates are subject to approval by the PURA in Connecticut and the MPUC in Maine. Our Regulated Companies are entitled to file rate increase requests, from time to time, to recover our investments in utility plant and expenses. Once a rate increase petition is filed with the respective agency, the ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly. We can provide no assurances that any future rate increase requests will be approved by each agency; and, if approved, we cannot guarantee that any such rate increase requests will be granted in a timely or sufficient manner to cover the investments and expenses for which we initially sought the rate increase. Additionally, a regulatory agency may rule that a company must reduce its rates.\nUnder a 2007 Connecticut law, the PURA authorizes regulated water companies to use a rate adjustment mechanism, known as a Water Infrastructure and Conservation Adjustment (\u201cWICA\u201d), for eligible projects completed and in service for the benefit of the customers. During 2013, the Maine Legislature has enacted a law that will allow Maine Water for expedited recovery of investments in water systems infrastructure replacement, both treatment and distribution, through a Water Infrastructure Charge (\u201cWISC\u201d), similar to WICA in Connecticut. Maine Water began to take advantage of the WISC during 2014.\nIf we are unable to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due, or we default under certain other provisions of our loan documents, our indebtedness could be accelerated and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $176.6 million in long-term debt outstanding. Our ability to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due will depend upon our current and future performance. Our performance is affected by many factors, some of which are beyond our control. We believe that our cash generated from operations, and, if necessary, borrowing under our existing and planned credit facilities, will be sufficient to enable us to make our debt payments as they become due. If, however, we do not generate sufficient cash, we may be required to refinance our obligations or sell additional equity, which may be on terms that are not favorable to the Company as current terms.\nNo assurance can be given that any debt refinancing or sale of equity will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms. In addition, our failure to comply with certain provisions contained in our trust indentures and loan agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness could lead to a default on these documents, which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness.\nCredit market volatility may affect our ability to refinance our existing debt, borrow funds under our existing lines of credit or incur additional debt.\nDuring certain periods of the Unites States credit and liquidity crisis of 2008-2009, the volatility and disruption in the credit and banking markets reached unprecedented levels. In many cases, the markets contained limited credit capacity for certain issuers, and lenders had requested shorter terms. The market for new debt financing was limited and in some cases not available at all. In addition, the markets had increased the uncertainty that lenders will be able to comply with their previous commitments. The Company noted improvements during the second half of 2009 and continuing through 2014. If significant market disruption and volatility return, the Company may not be able to refinance our existing debt when it comes due, draw upon our existing lines of credit or incur additional debt, which may require us to seek other funding sources to meet our liquidity needs or to fund our capital expenditures budget. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or other financing on reasonable terms, or at all.\nFailure to maintain our existing credit ratings could affect our cost of funds and related margins and liquidity position.\nSince 2003, Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services (\u201cS&P\u201d) has rated our outstanding debt and has given credit ratings to us and our subsidiary The Connecticut Water Company. Their evaluations are based on a number of factors, which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. On February 19, 2015, S&P affirmed its \u2018A\u2019 corporate credit rating on the Company. Additionally, S&P also affirmed the Company\u2019s ratings outlook as stable.\nWe may sustain losses that exceed or are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured.\nWe maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall legal and risk management strategy to minimize our potential liabilities. Our insurance programs have varying coverage limits, exclusions and maximums, and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make. Generally, our insurance policies cover property damage, worker\u2019s compensation, employer\u2019s liability, general liability and automobile liability. Each policy includes deductibles or self-insured retentions and policy limits for covered claims. As a result, we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured.\nAlthough in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs, there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. For example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage, increased premium costs or deductibles.\nOur inability to comply with debt covenants under our credit facilities could result in prepayment obligations.\nWe are obligated to comply with debt covenants under our loan and debt agreements. Failure to comply with covenants under our credit facilities could result in an event of default, which if not timely cured or waived, could result in us being required to repay or finance these borrowings before their due date, could limit future borrowings, and result in cross default issues and increase our borrowing costs. The covenants are normal and customary in bank and loan agreements. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2014.\nMarket conditions, interest rate changes or changes in demographics may unfavorably impact the value of our benefit plan assets and liabilities which then could require significant additional funding.\nThe performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the Company\u2019s pension and postretirement benefit plans and could significantly impact our results of operations and financial position. As detailed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has significant obligations in these areas and the Company holds significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations, which may affect investment returns, which may fall below the Company\u2019s projected return rates. A decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under the Company\u2019s pension and postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in value. Additionally, the Company\u2019s pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Also, future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable from our customers, and the results of operations and financial position of the Company could be negatively affected.\nOur operating costs could be significantly increased because of state and federal environmental and health and safety laws and regulations.\nOur water and wastewater operations are governed by extensive federal and state environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations, including the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Water Act and similar state laws, and federal and state regulations issued under these laws by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state environmental regulatory agencies. These laws and regulations establish, among other things, criteria and standards for drinking water and for discharges into the waters of the United States, the State of Connecticut and/or the State of Maine. Pursuant to these laws, we are required to obtain various environmental permits from environmental regulatory agencies for our operations. We cannot assure that we have been or will be at all times in full compliance with these laws, regulations and permits. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations are complex and change frequently. These laws, and the enforcement thereof, have tended to become more stringent over time. While we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with these laws and our permits, it is possible that new or stricter standards could be imposed that will raise our operating costs. Although these costs may be recovered in the form of higher rates, there can be no assurance that either the PURA or the MPUC would approve rate increases to enable us to fully recover such costs. In summary, we cannot be assured that our costs of complying with, or discharging liabilities under, current and future environmental and health and safety laws will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nClimate change laws and regulations may be adopted that could require compliance with greenhouse gas emissions standards and other climate change initiatives. Additional capital expenditures could be required and our operating costs could be increased in order to comply with new regulatory standards imposed by federal and state environmental agencies.\nClimate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide. Many scientists, legislators, and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Possible new climate change laws and regulations, if enacted, may require us to monitor and/or change our utility operations. It is possible that new standards could be imposed that will require additional capital expenditures or raise our operating costs. Because it is uncertain what laws will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Although these expenditures and costs may be recovered in the form of higher rates, there can be no assurance that either the PURA or the MPUC or other regulatory bodies that govern our business would permit us to recover such expenditures and costs. We cannot assure you that our costs of complying with new standards or laws will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nStreamflow Regulations in Connecticut could potentially impact our ability to serve our customers.\nIn December 2011, regulations concerning the flow of water in Connecticut\u2019s rivers and streams were adopted. As promulgated, the regulations require that certain downstream releases be made from seven of Connecticut Waters\u2019s eighteen active reservoirs no later than ten years following the adoption of stream classifications by the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (\u201cDEEP\u201d). Currently, downstream releases are made at two locations. No groundwater supply wells are affected by the regulations.\nDEEP has finalized stream classifications in one area of the state where Connecticut Water maintains and operates sources of supply. Other areas of the state, including areas where Connecticut Water operates, remain to be classified. The Company remains engaged in the process in order to minimize impact to our available water supply. Although significantly and favorably modified from prior versions, the regulations still have the potential to lower our safe yield, raise our capital and operating expenses and adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Because they affect only a subset of the Company\u2019s supplies and allow for releases to be scaled back in response to drought events, however, the overall impact is anticipated to be manageable. Costs associated with the regulations may be recovered in the form of higher rates. Although there can be no assurance the PURA would approve rate increases to enable us to recover all such costs, legislation passed in 2013 allows for a WICA surcharge to recover capital improvement costs necessary to achieve compliance with the regulations.\nThe State of Maine also has regulations that govern the flow of water in rivers and streams and also govern lake levels on great ponds. Code of Maine Rules Chapter 587 (\u201cChapter 587\u201d) regulates any activity that alters the flow or level of classified state waters after August 2007. Maine Water operates five water systems that use surface waters governed by this chapter. Maine Water has operated in full compliance with the chapter since its effective date and fully expect continued compliance. For public water systems, Chapter 587 allows the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (\u201cMDEP\u201d) to impose site specific conditions in locations where Maine\u2019s water quality classifications are not being met. Any conditions proposed on a water withdrawal by a public water system must consider the provisions of any legislative charter, the watershed protection benefits provided by the utility and the financial viability of the utility. Further, any conditions imposed must be accommodated by the existing MPUC approved rate schedule for the utility and may not, in and of themselves, cause a utility to request a rate increase from their customers. To date, the MDEP has not imposed any withdrawal conditions on any public water system in Maine.\nMaine Water\u2019s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations which could adversely affect demand for its water services and its revenues.\nDemand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other outside water use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels. In the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues.\nDeclining per customer residential water usage in the State of Maine may reduce our revenues, financial condition and results of operations in future years.\nA trend of declining per customer residential water usage has been observed for the last several years, which we attribute to increased water conservation, including the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential users. Our regulated business in Maine is heavily dependent on revenue generated from rates we charge to our residential customers for the volume of water they use. The rate we charge for our water is regulated by the MPUC in Maine and we may not unilaterally adjust our rates to reflect changes in demand. Declining volume of residential water usage may have a negative impact on our operating revenues in the future if regulators do not reflect any usage declines in the rate setting design process.\nPotential regulatory changes or drought conditions may impact our ability to serve our current and future customers\u2019 demand for water and our financial results.\nWe depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future demands of our customers. Changes in regulatory requirements could affect our ability to utilize existing supplies and/or secure new sources, as required. Insufficient supplies or an interruption in our water supply could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although not occurring in 2014, drought conditions could interfere with our sources of water supply and could adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our existing and future customers. An interruption in our water supply could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water, even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions, which may adversely affect our revenues and earnings.\nWe are increasingly dependent on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems, and a disruption of these systems, resulting from cyber security attacks or other events, could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on our information technology systems in connection with the operation of our business, especially with respect to customer service and billing, accounting and, in some cases, the monitoring and operation of our treatment, storage and pumping facilities. In addition, we rely on our systems to track our utility assets and to manage maintenance and construction projects, materials and supplies, and our human resource functions. A loss of these systems, or major problems with the operation of these systems, could adversely affect our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from the following types of cyber security attacks or other events:\n\u2022\npower loss, computer systems failures, and internet, telecommunications or data network failures;\n\u2022\noperator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees;\n\u2022\nphysical and electronic loss of data;\n\u2022\ncomputer viruses, cyber security attacks, intentional security breaches, hacking, denial of service actions, misappropriation of data and similar events;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the implementation of upgrades or modification to our information technology systems; and\n\u2022\nhurricanes, fires, floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters.\nRecognizing the increasing importance of managing and protecting electronic data, the Company, beginning in 2014, partnered with a consulting firm to evaluate the Company's cyber security strengths and vulnerabilities and to help in creating an evaluation of the Company's current information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) structure within the organization. In April 2014, a cyber security assessment analysis identified and prioritized steps that the Company should take to enhance its security surrounding cyber security. The Company is in the process of implementing recommendations contained in the cyber security assessment which it estimates will be completed in full by June 2016 and will require over $1 million in related internal and external labor costs and additional technological investments to complete.\nAlthough we do not believe that our systems are at a materially greater risk of cyber security attacks than other similar organizations, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from the types of cyber security attacks or other events listed above or other similar actions, and such incidents or other events may go undetected for a period of time. Such cyber security attacks or other events may result in: the loss or compromise of customer, financial or operational data; disruption of billing, collections or normal field service activities; disruption of electronic monitoring and control of operational systems; and delays in financial reporting and other normal management functions. Possible impacts associated with a cyber security attack or other events may include remediation costs related to lost, stolen, or compromised data, repairs to data processing systems, increased cyber security protection costs, adverse effects on our compliance with regulatory and environmental laws and regulation, including standards for drinking water, litigation and reputational damage.\nThe failure of, or the requirement to repair, upgrade or dismantle, any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe own and operate numerous dams throughout the States of Connecticut and Maine. While the Company maintains robust dam maintenance and inspection programs, a failure of any of those dams could result in injuries and damage to residential and/or commercial property downstream for which we may be responsible, in whole or in part. The failure of a dam could also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Any losses or liabilities incurred due to the failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates.\nAny failure of our reservoirs, storage tanks, mains or distribution networks could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation.\nConnecticut Water and Maine Water distribute water through an extensive network of mains and stores water in reservoirs and storage tanks located across Connecticut and Maine. A failure of major mains, reservoirs, or tanks could result in injuries and damage to residential and/or commercial property for which we may be responsible, in whole or in part. The failure of major mains, reservoirs or tanks may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our water distribution network in order to conduct repairs. Such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water delivery requirements prescribed by governmental regulators, including the PURA and the MPUC, and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and reputation. Any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates.\nAny future acquisitions we may undertake may involve risks and uncertainties.\nAn important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and integration of water systems in order to move into new service areas and to broaden our current service areas. As of the date of this filing, our Regulated Companies serve 123,071 customers, or a population of approximately 400,000 people, in 77 municipalities throughout Connecticut and Maine. We will be unable to acquire other businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates. It is our intent, when practical, to integrate any businesses we acquire with our existing operations. The negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management\u2019s time and resources. Future acquisitions by us could result in:\n\u2022\ndilutive issuances of our equity securities;\n\u2022\nincurrence of debt and contingent liabilities;\n\u2022\nfailure to have effective internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in quarterly results; and\n\u2022\nother acquisition-related expenses.\nSome or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business as well as our ability to finance our business and comply with regulatory requirements. The businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve sales and profitability that would justify our investment and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process, including the integration of controls necessary for internal control and financial reporting, could interfere with our operations, reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal controls. In addition, as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions.\nWater supply contamination may adversely affect our business.\nOur water supplies are subject to possible contamination, including contamination from the development of naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting from man-made sources, and possible terrorist attacks. In the event that our water supply is contaminated, we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source or provide additional treatment. We may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment methods. If we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source, or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost-effective manner, there may be an adverse effect on our revenues, operating results and financial condition. The costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition and may not be recoverable in rates. We could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage. For example, private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies. Our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims.\nWe operate a number of water and wastewater systems under O&M contracts and face the risk that the owners of those systems may fail to provide capital to properly maintain those systems, which may negatively affect us as the operators of the systems.\nWe operate a number of water and wastewater systems under O&M contracts. Pursuant to these contracts, we operate the system according to the standards set forth in the applicable contract, and it is generally the responsibility of the owner of the system to undertake capital improvements. In some cases, we may not be able to convince the owner to make needed improvements in order to maintain compliance with applicable regulations. Although violations and fines incurred by water and wastewater systems may be the responsibility of the owner of the system under these contracts, those non-compliance events may reflect poorly on us as the operator of the system and damage our reputation, and in some cases, may result in liability to the same extent as if we were the owner.\nIncreased security measures may continue to increase our operating costs.\nIn addition to the potential pollution of our water supply as described above, we have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply. We have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business. We have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities, operations and supplies. These costs may be significant. We are currently not aware of any specific threats to our facilities, operations or supplies; however, it is possible that we would not be in a position to control the outcome of terrorist events should they occur.\nThe accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will impact our operating results and financial condition.\nWe make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements regarding, among others:\n\u2022\nthe number of years to depreciate certain assets;\n\u2022\namounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable and uninsured losses;\n\u2022\nour legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims, including medical and workers\u2019 compensation claims;\n\u2022\nfuture costs for pensions and other post-retirement benefit obligations; and\n\u2022\npossible tax allowances.\nThe quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will have an impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs at the end of each accounting period. If our estimates are not accurate, we will be required to make an adjustment in a future period.\nThe final determination of our income tax liability may be materially different from our income tax provision.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. Our calculation of the provision for income taxes is subject to our interpretation of applicable business tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file. In addition, our income tax returns are subject to periodic examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. During 2013 and 2014, Connecticut Water and Maine Water, respectively, changed their tax method of accounting to permit the expensing of qualifying utility asset improvement costs that were previously being capitalized and depreciated for tax purposes. Our determination of what qualifies as a capital cost versus a repair expense tax deduction is subject to subsequent adjustment and may impact the income tax benefits that have been recognized. Although we believe our income tax estimates, including any tax reserves or valuation allowances we have recorded or may record, are appropriate, there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different; either higher or lower, from what is reflected in our income tax provision. In the event we are assessed additional income taxes, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nKey employee turnover may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team. The loss of the services of any member or our senior management team or the inability to hire and retain experienced management personnel could harm our operating results.\nWe must continue to attract and retain qualified technical and managerial personnel in order to succeed.\nOur future success will also depend largely upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, operational and financial managers. There is significant competition for such personnel in our industry. We try to ensure that we offer competitive compensation and benefits as well as opportunities for continued development, and we continually strive to recruit and train qualified personnel and retain key employees. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to grow and operate profitably.", "PERMNO": 26463, "SIC": 4941, "TIC": "CTWS"}
