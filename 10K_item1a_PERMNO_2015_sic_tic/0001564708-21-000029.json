RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating the Company and its common stock. Any of the following risks, or other risks or uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition, and could, in turn, impact the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nRisks Relating to the Company\u2019s Businesses and Operations\nThe Company Operates in a Highly Competitive Business Environment, and its Success Depends on its Ability to Compete Effectively, Including by Responding to Evolving Technologies and Changes in Consumer and Customer Behavior.\nThe Company faces significant competition from other providers of news, information, entertainment and real estate-related services, including both traditional and new providers. See \u201cBusiness Overview\u201d for more information regarding competition within each of the Company\u2019s segments. This competition continues to intensify as a result of changes in technologies, platforms and business models and corresponding changes in consumer and customer behavior, and the Company may be adversely affected if consumers or customers migrate to other alternatives. For example, enhanced internet capabilities, developments in content distribution platforms and the emergence of new media channels have led to alternative methods for the delivery, storage and consumption of content, which have increased the number of choices available to consumers for content consumption and have, in turn, adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, demand for the Company\u2019s newspapers, television programs and other products and services and the price consumers are willing to pay. Consumption of the Company\u2019s content on third-party delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control, loss of a direct relationship with consumers and lower engagement and subscription rates. These trends and developments have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, both the Company\u2019s circulation and subscription revenue and, in turn, advertisers\u2019 willingness to purchase advertising from the Company, as well as increase subscriber acquisition, retention and other costs.\nTechnological developments have in some cases also increased competition by lowering barriers to entry. For example, content providers are now able to compete more easily with the Company\u2019s pay-TV business via direct-to-consumer offerings, as internet streaming capabilities have enabled the disaggregation of content delivery from the ownership of network infrastructure. Other digital platforms and technologies, such as user-generated content platforms and self-publishing tools, have also reduced the effort and expense of producing and distributing certain types of content on a wide scale, allowing digital content providers, customers, suppliers and other third parties to compete with the Company, often at a lower cost. Additional digital distribution channels, such as online retailers and digital marketplaces, have presented, and may continue to present, challenges to the Company\u2019s business models, including its traditional book publishing model, which could adversely affect sales volume and/or pricing.\nIn order to compete effectively, the Company must differentiate and distinguish its brands and their associated products and services, respond to and develop new technologies, distribution channels and platforms, products and services and anticipate and consistently respond to changes in consumer and customer needs, tastes and behavior, which in turn, depends on many factors both within and beyond its control. For example, the Company relies on brand awareness, reputation and acceptance of its high-quality differentiated content and other products and services, the breadth, depth and accuracy of information provided by its digital real estate services and professional information businesses, as well as its wide array of digital offerings, in order to retain and grow its audiences, consumers and subscribers. However, consumer tastes change frequently and are difficult to predict, and when faced with a multitude of choices, consumers may place greater value on the convenience and price of content and other products and services than they do on their source, quality or reliability. Online traffic and product and service purchases are also driven by internet search results, referrals from social media and other platforms and visibility on digital marketplace platforms and in mobile app stores. Search engine results and digital marketplace and mobile app store rankings are based on algorithms that are changed frequently, and social media and other platforms may also vary their emphasis on what content to highlight for users. Any failure to successfully manage and adapt to these changes across the Company\u2019s businesses, including those affecting how the Company\u2019s content, apps, products and services are discovered, prioritized, displayed and monetized, could impede the Company\u2019s ability to compete effectively by significantly decreasing traffic to the Company\u2019s digital properties, lowering advertiser interest in those properties, increasing costs if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic and lowering product sales and subscriptions. A shortfall in the expected popularity or discoverability of the Company\u2019s content or other products and services could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company expects to continue to pursue new strategic initiatives and develop new and enhanced products and services in order to remain competitive, such as its streaming services, its recently launched transformation initiative and the continued expansion into various adjacencies at its digital real estate services businesses. The Company has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, significant costs in order to implement these strategies and develop these new products and services, including\ncosts to continue developing and improving its streaming services and costs related to its transformation initiative, as well as other costs to acquire, develop, adopt, upgrade and exploit new and existing technologies and attract and retain employees with the necessary knowledge and skills. There can be no assurance any strategic initiatives, products and services will be successful in the manner or time period or at the cost the Company expects or that it will realize the anticipated benefits it expects to achieve. The failure to realize those benefits could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSome of the Company\u2019s current and potential competitors may have greater resources, fewer regulatory burdens, better competitive positions in certain areas, greater operating capabilities, greater access to sources of content, data, technology or other services or strategic relationships and/or easier access to financing, which may allow them to respond more effectively to changes in technology, consumer and customer needs, preferences and behavior and market conditions. Continued consolidation among competitors in certain industries in which the Company operates may increase these advantages, including through greater scale, financial leverage and/or access to content, data, technology and other offerings. If the Company is unable to compete successfully against existing or future competitors, its business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nA Decline in Customer Advertising Expenditures in the Company\u2019s Newspaper and Other Businesses Could Cause its Revenues and Operating Results to Decline Significantly.\nThe Company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising, and its ability to generate advertising revenue is dependent on a number of factors, including: (1) demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, (2) audience fragmentation, (3) digital advertising trends, (4) its ability to offer advertising products and formats sought by advertisers, (5) general economic and business conditions, (6) demographics of the customer base, (7) advertising rates, (8) advertising effectiveness and (9) maintaining its brand strength and reputation.\nDemand for the Company\u2019s products and services is evaluated based on a variety of metrics. For example, circulation levels for the Company\u2019s newspapers, ratings points for its cable channels and number of listeners for its radio stations are among the factors advertisers consider when determining the amount of advertising to purchase from the Company as well as advertising rates. For the Company\u2019s digital media properties, advertisers evaluate consumer demand using metrics such as the number of visits, number of users and user engagement. Any difficulty or failure in accurately measuring demand, particularly demand generated through new platforms, may lead to under-measurement and, in turn, lower advertising pricing and spending.\nThe popularity of digital media among consumers as a source of news, entertainment and other content, and the ability of digital advertising offerings to deliver targeted advertising promptly, has driven a corresponding shift in advertising from traditional channels to digital platforms. Large digital platforms in particular, such as Facebook, Google and Amazon, which have extensive audience reach, audience data and targeting capabilities, have commanded an increasing share of the digital advertising market in recent years, and the Company expects this trend to continue. The shift to digital media has significantly impacted the Company\u2019s print advertising revenues, which have declined in each of its last three fiscal years. New devices and technologies, as well as higher consumer engagement with other forms of digital media platforms such as online and mobile social networking, have also increased the number of media choices and formats available to audiences, resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising. The range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising. In addition, in the past, rates have been generally lower for mobile advertising than for desktop advertising. As a result, increasing consumer reliance on mobile devices has added, and may continue to add, additional pricing pressure. Consequently, despite continued growth in the Company\u2019s digital advertising revenues, such revenues may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption.\nThe digital advertising market also continues to undergo changes that may further impact digital advertising revenues. Programmatic buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale play a significant role in the advertising marketplace and have caused and may continue to cause further downward pricing pressure. New third-party delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control, loss of a direct relationship with consumers and adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to understand its audience and/or collect and apply data for targeted advertising. The Company\u2019s digital advertising operations also rely on a small number of significant technologies such as Google\u2019s ad manager which, if interrupted or meaningfully changed, or if the providers leverage their power to alter the economic structure, could adversely impact advertising revenues. In addition, evolving standards for the delivery of digital advertising, as well as the development and implementation of technology, regulations, policies and practices that adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver, target or measure the effectiveness of its advertising, including blocking, changing the location of, or obscuring, the display of advertising on websites and mobile devices, browsing incognito, blocking or deleting cookies and IP addresses, the phase-out of browser\nsupport for third party cookies and mobile operating system identifiers used for advertising purposes, as well as opt-in requirements, may also negatively impact digital advertising revenues. As the digital advertising market continues to evolve, the Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully for advertising budgets will depend on, among other things, its ability to drive scale, engage and grow digital audiences, collect and leverage better user data, develop new digital advertising products and formats such as branded and other custom content, and video and mobile advertising, and demonstrate the value of its advertising and the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s platforms to its advertising customers, including through more targeted, data-driven offerings.\nThe Company\u2019s print and digital advertising revenue is also affected generally by overall national and local economic and business conditions, which tend to be cyclical, as well as election and other news cycles. Natural disasters, including extreme weather, pandemics (including the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic) and other widespread health crises or acts of terrorism have led and could continue to lead to greater economic uncertainty and reduced spending by advertisers. The Company experienced a material negative impact on advertising revenues primarily in the first half of fiscal 2021 because of weakness in the advertising market due to COVID-19. In addition, certain sectors of the economy account for a significant portion of the Company\u2019s advertising revenues, including retail, technology and finance. Some of these sectors, such as retail, are more sensitive to weakness in economic conditions, as well as increased online competition. A decline in the economic prospects of these and other advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers\u2019 spending priorities or result in consolidation or closures across various industries, which may reduce the Company\u2019s overall advertising revenue.\nWhile the Company has adopted a number of strategies and initiatives to address these challenges, there can be no guarantee that its efforts will be successful. If the Company is unable to demonstrate the continuing value of its various platforms and high-quality content and brands or offer advertisers unique multi-platform advertising programs, its results may suffer. Reduced demand for the Company\u2019s offerings, a decrease in advertising expenditures by the Company\u2019s customers or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Inability to Obtain and Retain Sports, Entertainment and Other Programming Rights and Content Could Adversely Affect the Revenue of Certain of the Company\u2019s Operating Businesses, and Costs Could Also Increase Upon Renewal.\nCompetition for popular programming licensed from third parties is intense, and the success of certain of the Company\u2019s operating businesses, including its subscription television business, depends on, among other things, their ability to obtain and retain rights to desirable programming and certain related elements thereof, such as music rights, that enable them to deliver content to subscribers and audiences in the manner in which they wish to consume it and at competitive prices. The subscription television industry, including the Company\u2019s subscription television business, has experienced higher programming costs due to, among other things, (1) increases imposed by sports, entertainment and other programmers when offering new programming or upon the expiration of existing contracts; (2) the carriage of incremental programming, including new services and SVOD programming; and (3) increased competition from other digital media companies, including streaming services, for the rights to popular or exclusive content. Certain of the Company\u2019s operating businesses, including its subscription television business, are party to contracts for sports, entertainment and other programming rights with various third parties, including professional sports leagues and teams, television and motion picture producers and other content providers. These contracts have varying durations and renewal terms, and as they expire, renewals on favorable terms may be sought. In the course of renegotiating these and other agreements as they expire, the financial and other terms, such as exclusivity rights, under these contracts may change as a result of various reasons beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as changes in the Company\u2019s bargaining power or in the industry, and in order to retain or extend such rights, the Company may be required to increase the value of its offer to amounts that substantially exceed the existing contract costs. Furthermore, third parties may outbid the Company for those rights and/or for any new programming offerings. In addition, as other content providers develop their own competing services, they may be unwilling to provide the Company with access to certain content. For example, professional sports leagues or teams, as well as programmers and distributors such as ViacomCBS and Disney, have created and may continue to create their own direct-to-consumer offerings. Further, consolidation among content providers may increase the amount of content that could become unavailable to the Company and/or increase the scale and bargaining power of those providers. The loss of rights or any adverse changes to existing rights, including loss of exclusivity, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to differentiate its services and the breadth or quality of the Company\u2019s content offerings, including the extent of the sports coverage and the availability of other popular entertainment programming offered by the Company, and lead to customer or audience dissatisfaction or, in some cases, loss of customers or audiences, which could, in turn, adversely affect its revenues. In addition, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if upon renewal, escalations in programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in subscriber and carriage fees and advertising rates. The long-term nature of some of the Company\u2019s content commitments may also limit its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, business and economic conditions and the market segments in which it operates.\nThe Company Has Made and May Continue to Make Strategic Acquisitions, Investments and Divestitures That Introduce Significant Risks and Uncertainties.\nIn order to position its business to take advantage of growth opportunities, the Company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments that involve significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, among others: (1) the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses, operations and systems, including financial reporting, internal controls and information technology, in an efficient and effective manner, (2) the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits, (3) the potential loss of key employees, customers and suppliers, (4) with respect to investments, risks associated with the inability to control the operations of the business, (5) the risk of diverting the attention of the Company\u2019s senior management from the Company\u2019s operations, (6) in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments, the impact of specific economic, tax, currency, political, legal and regulatory risks associated with the relevant countries, (7) expenses and liabilities, both known and unknown, associated with the acquired businesses or investments, (8) in some cases, increased regulation and (9) in some cases, lower liquidity as a result of the use of cash or incurrence of debt to fund such acquisition or investment. If any acquired business or investment fails to operate as anticipated or an acquired business cannot be successfully integrated with the Company\u2019s existing businesses, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation could be adversely affected, and the Company may be required to record non-cash impairment charges for the write-down of certain acquired assets and investments. The Company\u2019s ability to continue to make acquisitions depends on the availability of suitable candidates at acceptable prices and whether restrictions are imposed by regulations, and competition for certain types of acquisitions is significant.\nThe Company has also divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with its strategic direction or growth targets. Divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. These include, among others, the inability to find potential buyers on favorable terms, disruption to its business and/or diversion of management attention from other business concerns, loss of key employees, difficulties in separating the operations of the divested business, retention of certain liabilities related to the divested business and indemnification or other post-closing claims.\nThe Company\u2019s Pay-TV Business Depends on a Single or Limited Number of Suppliers for Certain Key Products and Services, and Any Reduction or Interruption in the Supply of These Products and Services or a Significant Increase in Price Could Have an Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nThe Company\u2019s pay-TV business depends on a single or limited number of third party suppliers to supply certain key products and services necessary to provide its pay-TV services. In particular, the Company depends on Optus to provide all of its satellite transponder capacity and CommScope and Jonsa to supply its set-top boxes, and the Company expects its reliance on these suppliers to increase as it continues to migrate broadcast subscribers to satellite or internet delivery over the next several years. If any of these suppliers breaches or terminates its agreement with the Company or otherwise fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner, experiences operating or financial difficulties, is unable to meet demand due to component shortages, insufficient capacity or otherwise, significantly increases the amount the Company pays for necessary products or services or ceases production of any necessary product, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, Telstra is the primary supplier of cable distribution capacity for the Company\u2019s pay-TV programming and is also currently the exclusive provider of wholesale fixed voice and broadband services for the Company\u2019s pay-TV business and the largest reseller of its cable and satellite products. Any disruption in the supply of those services or a decline in Telstra\u2019s business could result in disruptions to the supply of, and/or reduce the number of subscribers for, the Company\u2019s products and services, which could, in turn, adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile the Company will seek alternative sources for the products and services described above where possible and/or permissible under applicable agreements, it may not be able to develop these alternative sources quickly and cost-effectively, which could impair its ability to timely deliver its products and services to its subscribers or operate its business.\nThe Company\u2019s International Operations Expose it to Additional Risks that Could Adversely Affect its Business, Operating Results and Financial Condition.\nIn its fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, approximately 63% of the Company\u2019s revenues were derived outside the U.S., and the Company is focused on expanding the international scope of its operations. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally and other risks may be heightened, including (1) issues related to managing international operations; (2) economic uncertainties and volatility in local markets and political or social instability; (3) the impact of catastrophic events in relevant\njurisdictions such as natural disasters, including extreme weather (which may occur with increasing frequency and intensity), pandemics (including COVID-19) and other widespread health crises or acts of terrorism; (4) compliance with international laws, regulations and policies, including foreign tax regimes and potential adverse changes thereto, foreign ownership restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange, data privacy requirements such as the GDPR, foreign intellectual property laws and local labor and employment laws and regulations; (5) compliance with anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act; and (6) increasing regulatory or governmental action against the Company\u2019s products and services such as censorship or other restrictions on access, expulsion of journalists or other employees and other retaliatory actions, including as a result of trade and other disputes with the U.S. For example, Brexit may continue to adversely affect, among other things, economic and market conditions in the U.K. and the European Union, create uncertainty around doing business in the U.K. and result in additional costs and compliance obligations, including with respect to tariffs and other trade barriers, data protection and transfer, tax rates and the recruitment and retention of employees. Events or developments related to these and other risks associated with the Company\u2019s international operations could result in reputational harm and have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Challenges associated with operating globally may increase as the Company continues to expand into geographic areas that it believes represent the highest growth opportunities.\nThe Company is Party to Agreements with Third Parties Relating to Certain of its Businesses That Contain Operational and Management Restrictions and/or Other Rights That, Depending on the Circumstances, May Not be in the Best Interest of the Company.\nThe Company is party to agreements with third parties relating to certain of its businesses that restrict the Company\u2019s ability to take specified actions and contain other rights that, depending on the circumstances, may not be in the best interest of the Company. For example, the Company and Telstra are parties to a Shareholders\u2019 Agreement with respect to Foxtel containing certain minority protections for Telstra, including standard governance provisions, as well as transfer and exit rights. The Shareholders\u2019 Agreement provides Telstra with the right to appoint two directors to the Board of Foxtel, as well as Board and shareholder-level veto rights over certain non-ordinary course and/or material corporate actions that may prevent Foxtel from taking actions that are in the interests of the Company. The Shareholders\u2019 Agreement also provides for (1) certain transfer restrictions, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to effect such transfers and/or the prices at which those transfers may occur, and (2) exit arrangements, which could, in certain circumstances, force the Company to sell its interest, subject to rights of first and, in some cases, last refusals.\nIn addition, Move, the Company\u2019s digital real estate services business in the U.S., operates the realtor.com\u00ae website under an agreement with NAR that is perpetual in duration. However, NAR may terminate the operating agreement for certain contractually-specified reasons upon expiration of applicable cure periods. If the operating agreement with NAR is terminated, the NAR License would also terminate, and Move would be required to transfer a copy of the software that operates the realtor.com\u00ae website to NAR and provide NAR with copies of its agreements with advertisers and data content providers. NAR would then be able to operate a realtor.com\u00ae website, either by itself or with another third party.\nDamage, Failure or Destruction of Satellites and Transmitter Facilities that the Company\u2019s Pay-TV Business Depends Upon to Distribute its Programming Could Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nThe Company\u2019s pay-TV business uses satellite systems to transmit its programming to its subscribers and/or authorized sublicensees. The Company\u2019s distribution facilities include uplinks, communications satellites and downlinks, and the Company also uses studio and transmitter facilities. Transmissions may be disrupted or degraded as a result of local disasters, including extreme weather (which may occur with increasing frequency and intensity), power outages, terrorist attacks, cyberattacks or other similar events, that damage or destroy on-ground uplinks or downlinks or studio and transmitter facilities, or as a result of damage to a satellite. Satellites are subject to significant operational and environmental risks while in orbit, including anomalies resulting from various factors such as manufacturing defects and problems with power or control systems, as well as environmental hazards such as meteoroid events, electrostatic storms and collisions with space debris. These events may result in the loss of one or more transponders on a satellite or the entire satellite and/or reduce the useful life of the satellite, which could, in turn, lead to a disruption or loss of video services to the Company\u2019s customers. The Company does not carry commercial insurance for business disruptions or losses resulting from the foregoing events as it believes the cost of insurance premiums is uneconomical relative to the risk. Instead, the Company seeks to mitigate this risk through the maintenance of backup satellite capacity and other contingency plans. However, these steps may not be sufficient, and if the Company is unable to secure alternate distribution, studio and/or transmission facilities in a timely manner, any such disruption or loss could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Loss of Key Personnel, or the Failure to Attract and Retain Other Highly Qualified Personnel, Could Harm the Company\u2019s Business.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses depend upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of its corporate and divisional executive teams and other highly qualified employees who possess substantial business, technical and operational knowledge. The market for highly skilled personnel, including for technology-related, product development, data science, marketing and sales roles, is very competitive, and the Company cannot ensure that it will be successful in retaining these employees or hiring and training suitable additions or replacements without significant costs or delays, particularly as its focus on digital products and services increases. These risks may be further exacerbated by changes in the nature of the office environment and remote working as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly if the Company\u2019s needs are not aligned with increased demand for flexible work arrangements or as a result of workplace culture challenges due to increased remote working. The loss of key employees, or the failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel, could harm the Company\u2019s business, including the ability to execute its business strategy.\nAny Significant Increase in Newsprint Costs or Disruption in the Company\u2019s Newsprint Supply Chain or Newspaper Printing and Distribution Channels may Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nNewsprint is a significant expense for the Company\u2019s newspaper publishing units. The price of newsprint has historically been volatile, and a number of factors may cause prices to increase, including: (1) the closure and consolidation of newsprint mills or the conversion of newsprint mills to other products or grades of paper, which has reduced the number of newsprint suppliers over the years; (2) the imposition of tariffs or other restrictions on non-U.S. suppliers of paper; (3) an increase in supplier operating expenses due to rising raw material or energy costs or other factors; (4) failure to maintain the Company\u2019s current consumption levels; and (5) the inability to maintain the Company\u2019s existing relationships with its newsprint suppliers. The Company also relies on third party suppliers for deliveries of newsprint and on third-party printing and distribution partners to print and distribute its newspapers in a number of key areas, including printing of the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and Barron\u2019s in New York. Financial pressures, newspaper industry economics, labor unrest, changes in laws and regulations, trucking shortages, ocean freight and customs delays and other transportation issues, natural disasters, including extreme weather (which may occur with increasing frequency and intensity), pandemics and other widespread health crises or other circumstances affecting these third-party suppliers and print and distribution partners could lead to disruptions, reduced operations or consolidations within the Company\u2019s newsprint supply chain and/or of third-party print sites and/or distribution routes. The Company may not be able to develop alternative providers quickly and cost-effectively, which could disrupt printing and distribution operations or increase the cost of printing and distributing the Company\u2019s newspapers. Any significant increase in the cost of newsprint, undersupply or significant disruptions in the newsprint supply chain or newspaper printing and distribution channels could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is Subject to Payment Processing Risk Which Could Lead to Adverse Effects on the Company\u2019s Business and Results of Operations.\nThe Company\u2019s customers pay for its products and services using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, prepaid cards, direct debit, online wallets and through direct carrier and partner billing. The Company relies on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment. Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations and require payment of interchange and other fees. To the extent there are increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, delays in receiving payments from payment processors, any failures to comply with, or changes to, rules or regulations concerning payments, loss of payment or billing partners and/or disruptions or failures in, or fraudulent use of or access to, payment processing systems or payment products, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely impacted and it could suffer reputational harm. Furthermore, if the Company is unable to maintain its fraud and chargeback rates at acceptable levels, card networks may impose fines and its card approval rate may be impacted. The termination of the Company\u2019s ability to process payments on any major payment method would adversely affect its business and results of operations.\nLabor Disputes May Have an Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Business.\nIn a variety of the Company\u2019s businesses, it engages the services of employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. If the Company is unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business by causing delays in production or by reducing profit margins.\nMacroeconomic and Market Risks\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic and Other Similar Epidemics, Pandemics or Widespread Health Crises Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Business, Results of Operations, Cash Flows and Financial Position.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and the resulting responses of governments, businesses and consumers, have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. The COVID-19 pandemic led to the implementation of unprecedented and wide-ranging measures by international, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of the virus, including quarantines, shelter-in-place and other social distancing orders, event cancellations, travel restrictions and orders for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures to prevent its spread caused significant and prolonged unemployment and a decline in consumer confidence and created significant economic volatility, uncertainty and disruption. Other epidemics, pandemics or widespread health crises may have similar effects.\nDuring fiscal 2021, particularly in the first half, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact the Company\u2019s businesses, although the impacts moderated relative to fiscal 2020. For example, business restrictions and shelter-in-place orders caused a decline in print newspaper volumes, while postponements and cancellations of sports events negatively impacted commercial subscription revenues and broadcast and Kayo subscribers. Advertising revenues also declined due to the resulting economic downturn. While the Company saw growth in other areas, including digital subscribers at its newspaper businesses, book sales at its Book Publishing segment and audience growth at realtor.com\u00ae, driven in part by pandemic-related circumstances and the news environment, this growth may not be sustainable.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company instituted remote working arrangements for a substantial majority of its employees. While these arrangements have not materially affected the Company\u2019s ability to maintain its business operations to date, these work arrangements could, in the future, strain the Company\u2019s business continuity plans, introduce operational risk, including cybersecurity risks or risks to the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal controls, and affect the Company\u2019s productivity and ability to manage its business and perform critical functions.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other similar epidemics, pandemics or widespread health crises will depend on, among other things, the severity, duration, spread and any reoccurrence of such crises, the impact of governmental actions and business and consumer behavior in response, the effectiveness of actions taken to contain or mitigate outbreaks and prevent or limit any reoccurrence, including the development, availability and public acceptance of effective treatments and vaccines, the resulting global economic conditions and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and other similar epidemics, pandemics or widespread health crises may amplify many of the other risk factors disclosed elsewhere in this \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nWeak Domestic and Global Economic Conditions and Volatility and Disruption in the Financial and Other Markets May Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business.\nThe U.S. and global economies have undergone, and may in the future experience, periods of economic and market weakness and uncertainty, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, trade disputes between a number of countries and higher inflation. These conditions have resulted in, among other things, a tightening of, and in some cases more limited access to, the credit and capital markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, lower consumer and business spending, lower consumer net worth and a decline in the real estate market. Such weakness and uncertainty and associated market disruptions have often led to broader, prolonged economic downturns that have historically resulted in lower advertising expenditures, lower demand for the Company\u2019s products and services and unfavorable changes in the mix of products and services purchased and have adversely affected the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Any continued or recurring economic weakness is likely to have a similar impact on the Company\u2019s business and reduce its circulation and subscription, advertising, real estate, consumer and other revenues and otherwise negatively impact the performance of its businesses. The Company is particularly exposed to certain Australian business risks, including specific Australian legal and regulatory risks, consumer preferences and competition, because it holds a substantial amount of Australian assets and generated approximately 42% of its fiscal 2021 revenues from Australia. As a result, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by negative developments in the Australian market, including, for example, weakness in the Australian residential real estate market which has led, and may in the future lead, to lower listing volumes at REA Group. The Company also generated approximately 14% of its fiscal 2021 revenues from the U.K., which continues to experience political, regulatory, economic and market uncertainty following its exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d While the U.K. and the European Union have entered into a trade and cooperation agreement,\nwhich provides a framework for the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the European Union, significant political and economic uncertainty remains as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation. The impact on the Company\u2019s business of any treaties, laws and regulations that replace the existing European Union counterparts, or other governmental or regulatory actions taken by the U.K. or the European Union in connection with or subsequent to Brexit, cannot be predicted, including whether or not regulators will continue to approve or impose material conditions on the Company\u2019s business activities. In addition, Brexit may lead to a downturn in the U.K. or other European economies and could lead to lower access to European markets, in general. Any of these effects, and others the Company cannot anticipate, could have a material adverse effect on its businesses in the U.K. and elsewhere.\nIn addition, further volatility and disruption in the financial markets could make it more difficult and expensive for the Company to obtain financing or refinance its existing indebtedness. These conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom the Company does business to satisfy their obligations to the Company, including as a result of their inability to obtain capital on acceptable terms. Although the Company believes that its cash on hand, operating cash flow and current access to credit and capital markets, including the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility, will give it the ability to meet its financial needs for at least the next 12 months, there can be no assurance that any further volatility and disruption in domestic and global credit and capital markets will not impair the Company\u2019s liquidity or increase its cost of borrowing.\nFluctuations in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Could Have an Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Results of Operations.\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its consolidated debt when the debt is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operations whose cash flows support the ability to repay or refinance such debt. As of June 30, 2021, the Foxtel operating subsidiaries, whose functional currency is Australian dollars, had approximately $354 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company\u2019s policy is to hedge against the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements with respect to this exposure where commercially reasonable. However, there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all, or that there will not be a default by any of the counterparties to those arrangements.\nIn addition, the Company is exposed to foreign currency translation risk because it has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of its operations are conducted in currencies other than the Company\u2019s reporting currency, primarily the Australian dollar and the British pound sterling. Since the Company\u2019s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, a currency translation impact on the Company\u2019s earnings when the results of those operations that are reported in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, which could, in turn, have an adverse effect on its reported results of operations in a given period or in specific markets.\nRisks Related to Information Technology, Cybersecurity and Data Protection\nThe Company Relies on Network and Information Systems and Other Technology Whose Failure or Misuse Could Cause a Disruption of Services or Loss, Improper Access to or Disclosure of Personal Data, Business Information, Including Intellectual Property, or Other Confidential Information, Resulting in Increased Costs, Loss of Revenue, Reputational Damage or Other Harm to the Company\u2019s Business.\nNetwork and information systems and other technologies, including those related to the Company\u2019s content delivery networks and network management, are important to its business activities and contain the Company\u2019s proprietary, confidential and sensitive business information, including personal data of its customers and personnel. The Company also relies on third party providers for certain technology and \u201ccloud-based\u201d systems and services that support a variety of business operations. Network and information systems-related events affecting the Company\u2019s systems, or those of third parties upon which the Company\u2019s business relies, such as computer compromises, cyber threats and attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, ransomware and denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities by individuals or state-sponsored or other groups, or any combination of the foregoing, as well as power and internet outages, equipment failure, natural disasters, including extreme weather (which may occur with increasing frequency and intensity), terrorist activities, war, human or technological error or malfeasance that may affect such systems, could result in disruption of the Company\u2019s services and business and/or loss, corruption, improper access to or disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. Unauthorized parties may also fraudulently induce the Company\u2019s employees or other agents to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to the Company\u2019s systems, facilities or data, or those of third parties with whom the Company does business. In addition, any design or manufacturing defects in, or the improper implementation of, hardware or software applications the Company develops or procures from third parties could unexpectedly disrupt the Company\u2019s network and information systems or compromise information security. System redundancy may be\nineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s disaster recovery and business continuity planning may not be sufficient to address all potential cyber events or other disruptions.\nIn recent years, there has been a significant rise in the number of cyberattacks on companies\u2019 network and information systems, and such attacks are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, targeted and difficult to detect and prevent against. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote work and remote access to the Company\u2019s systems has increased significantly, which may adversely impact the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s security measures. Consequently, the risks associated with such an event continue to increase, particularly as the Company\u2019s digital businesses expand. The Company has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, none of which have been material to the Company to date, individually or in the aggregate. However, there is no assurance that there will not be a cybersecurity threat or incident that has a material adverse effect in the future. While the Company and its vendors have developed and implemented security measures and internal controls that are designed to protect personal data, business information, including intellectual property, and other confidential information, to prevent system disruption, data loss or corruption, and to prevent or detect security breaches, such measures may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring, particularly given that techniques used to access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently. Additionally, it may be difficult to detect and defend against certain threats and vulnerabilities that can persist over extended periods of time. Any network and information systems-related events could require the Company to expend significant resources to remedy such event. Moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. While the Company maintains cyber risk insurance, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any future breaches of the Company\u2019s systems and does not extend to reputational damage or costs incurred to improve or strengthen systems against future incidents. Cyber risk insurance has also become more difficult and expensive to obtain, and the Company cannot be certain that its current level of insurance or the breadth of its terms and conditions will continue to be available on economically reasonable terms.\nA significant failure, compromise, breach or interruption of the Company\u2019s systems, or those of third parties upon which its business relies, could result in a disruption of its operations, including degradation or disruption of service, equipment damage, customer, audience or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to its reputation or brands, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, lawsuits, remediation costs, a loss of or inability to attract new customers, audience, advertisers or business partners or loss of revenues and other financial losses. If any such failure, compromise, breach, interruption or similar event results in improper access to or disclosure of information maintained in the Company\u2019s information systems and networks or those of its vendors, including financial, personal and credit card data, as well as confidential and proprietary information relating to personnel, customers, vendors and the Company\u2019s business, including its intellectual property, the Company could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy, as well as private individual or class action lawsuits. The Company may also be required to notify certain governmental agencies and/or regulators (including the appropriate EU supervisory authority) about any actual or perceived data security breach, as well as the individuals who are affected by any such incident, within strict time periods. In addition, media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities in the Company\u2019s systems or those of third parties upon which its business relies, even if nothing has actually been attempted or occurred, could also adversely impact the Company\u2019s brand and reputation and materially affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to Comply with Complex and Evolving U.S. and Foreign Laws and Regulations Regarding Privacy, Data Use and Data Protection Could Have an Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business activities are subject to various and increasing laws and regulations in the United States and internationally governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which have implications for how such data is managed. Many of these laws and regulations are increasingly complex and continue to evolve, and substantial uncertainty surrounds their scope and application. Moreover, data privacy and security laws may potentially conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with these laws and regulations could be costly and resource-intensive, require the Company to change its business practices, or limit or restrict aspects of the Company\u2019s business in a manner adverse to its business operations, including by inhibiting or preventing the collection of information that would enable it to provide more targeted, data-driven advertising offerings. The Company\u2019s failure to comply, even if inadvertent or in good faith, or as a result of a compromise, breach or interruption of the Company\u2019s systems by a third party, could result in exposure to enforcement by U.S. federal, state or local or foreign governments or private parties, as well as significant negative publicity and reputational damage. Examples of such laws include the European Union\u2019s GDPR and the UK DPA, each of which expands the regulation of personal data processing throughout the European Union and the U.K., respectively, and significantly increases maximum penalties for non-compliance, California\u2019s CCPA and forthcoming CPRA and Virginia\u2019s CDPA, which establish certain transparency rules, put greater restrictions on the collection, use and sharing of personal information of their respective state residents and provide such\nresidents with certain rights regarding their personal information. See \u201cGovernmental Regulation-Data Privacy and Security\u201d for more information.\nRisks Related to Financial Results and Position\nThe Indebtedness of the Company and Certain of its Subsidiaries may Affect their Ability to Operate their Businesses, and may have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The Company and its Subsidiaries may be able to Incur Substantially More Debt, which Could Further Exacerbate the Risks Described Herein.\nAs of June 30, 2021, News Corp had $2.15 billion of total outstanding indebtedness (excluding related party debt) with maturities ranging from fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2029, including $854 million and $314 million, respectively, of indebtedness held by its non-wholly owned subsidiaries, Foxtel and REA Group (collectively with News Corp, the \u201cDebtors\u201d). The indebtedness of the Debtors and the terms of their financing arrangements could: (1) limit their ability to obtain additional financing in the future; (2) make it more difficult for them to satisfy their obligations under the terms of their financing arrangements, including the provisions of any relevant debt instruments, credit agreements, indentures and similar or associated documents (collectively, the \u201cDebt Documents\u201d); (3) limit their ability to refinance their indebtedness on terms acceptable to them or at all; (4) limit their flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which they operate and increase their vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; (5) require them to dedicate a substantial portion of their cash flow to make interest and principal payments on their debt, thereby limiting the availability of their cash flow to fund future investments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements; (6) subject them to higher levels of indebtedness than their competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce their flexibility in responding to increased competition; and (7) in the case of the Company\u2019s fixed rate indebtedness, which includes prepayment penalties, diminish the Company\u2019s ability to benefit from any future decrease in interest rates.\nThe ability of the Debtors to satisfy their debt service obligations (including any repurchase obligations) and to fund other cash needs will depend on the Debtors\u2019 future performance and other factors such as changes in interest rates affecting the Debtors\u2019 variable rate indebtedness. Although the Company hedges a portion of this interest rate exposure, there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all, or that there will not be a default by any of the counterparties. If the Debtors do not generate enough cash to pay their debt service obligations and fund their other cash requirements, they may be required to restructure or refinance all or part of their existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise additional equity, any or all of which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. The Company and its subsidiaries, including the Debtors, may also be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which could exacerbate the effects described elsewhere in this \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nIn addition, the Debtors\u2019 outstanding Debt Documents contain financial and operating covenants that may limit their operational and financial flexibility. These covenants include compliance with, or maintenance of, certain financial tests and ratios and may, depending on the applicable Debtor and subject to certain exceptions, restrict or prohibit such Debtor and/or its subsidiaries from, among other things, incurring or guaranteeing debt, undertaking certain transactions (including certain investments and acquisitions), disposing of certain properties or assets (including subsidiary stock), merging or consolidating with any other person, making financial accommodation available, entering into certain other financing arrangements, creating or permitting certain liens, engaging in transactions with affiliates, making repayments of certain other loans, undergoing fundamental business changes and/or paying dividends or making other restricted payments and investments. Various risks, uncertainties and events beyond the Debtors\u2019 control could affect their ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants. In the event any of these covenants are breached and such breach results in a default under any Debt Documents, the lenders or noteholders, as applicable, may accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness under the applicable Debt Documents, which could result in a cross-default under other outstanding Debt Documents and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operation and financial condition.\nThe Company Could Suffer Losses Due to Asset Impairment and Restructuring Charges.\nAs a result of changes in the Company\u2019s industry and market conditions, the Company has recognized, and may in the future recognize, impairment charges for write-downs of goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other long-lived assets, as well as restructuring charges relating to the reorganization of its businesses, which negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and, in the case of cash restructuring charges, its financial condition. Impairments and restructuring charges may also negatively impact the Company\u2019s taxes, including its ability to realize its deferred tax assets and deduct certain interest costs. The Company\u2019s management must regularly evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to the Company\u2019s cash flows in order to determine whether, based on projected discounted future cash flows and other market assumptions, the carrying value for such assets exceeds current fair value and the Company should recognize an\nimpairment. In accordance with GAAP, the Company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. The Company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators, such as prevailing conditions in the business environment, credit and capital markets or the economy generally and actual or projected operating results, require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets, as well as other investments and long-lived assets, or require the Company to engage in any additional business restructurings to address these conditions. For example, any significant shortfall, now or in the future, in advertising revenue or subscribers, the expected popularity of the content for which the Company has acquired rights and/or consumer acceptance of its products could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units. Any downward revisions in the fair value of a reporting unit, indefinite-lived intangible assets, investments or other long-lived assets could result in additional impairments for which non-cash charges would be required, and any such charge could be material to the Company\u2019s reported results of operations. The Company may also incur additional restructuring charges in the future if it is required to further realign its resources in response to significant shortfalls in revenue or other adverse trends.\nThe Company Could Be Subject to Significant Additional Tax Liabilities, which Could Adversely Affect its Operating Results and Financial Condition.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in U.S. federal, state and local jurisdictions and various non-U.S. jurisdictions, including Australia and the U.K. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate is impacted by the tax laws, regulations, practices and interpretations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on, among other things, the geographic mix of the Company\u2019s profits and losses, changes in tax laws and regulations or their application and interpretation, the outcome of tax audits and changes in valuation allowances associated with the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets. New proposals at the U.S. federal level to increase the U.S. corporate tax rate and minimum taxes on non-U.S. income could, if enacted, have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s future tax rate and increase its tax provision. The Company may be required to record additional valuation allowances if, among other things, adverse economic conditions negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to realize its deferred tax assets. Evaluating and estimating the Company\u2019s tax provision, current and deferred tax assets and liabilities and other tax accruals requires significant management judgment, and there are often transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.\nThe Company\u2019s tax returns are routinely audited by various tax authorities. Tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the Company\u2019s tax returns or positions taken by the Company, and as a result, tax-related settlements or litigation may occur, resulting in additional income tax liabilities against the Company. Although the Company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of tax reviews and examinations and any related litigation, the final outcomes of these matters could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the Financial Statements. As a result, the Company may be required to recognize additional charges in its Statements of Operations and pay significant additional amounts with respect to current or prior periods, or its taxes in the future could increase, which could adversely affect its operating results and financial condition.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) continues to develop a framework of globally coordinated reforms to address the tax challenges arising from globalization and the digitalization of the economy, including expanded taxing rights for countries and the adoption of a global minimum taxation regime. The scope and application of the framework continues to evolve, and its outcome may alter aspects of how the Company\u2019s tax obligations are determined in countries in which it does business. Several jurisdictions have separately enacted new digital services taxes which have had limited impact on the Company\u2019s overall tax obligations, however, the Company continues to monitor proposals as they are introduced. If new taxes on digital services are imposed on the Company, it could have an adverse impact on its business and financial performance.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nAdverse Results from Litigation or Other Proceedings Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business Practices and Operating Results.\nFrom time to time, the Company is party to litigation, as well as to regulatory and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies, including with respect to antitrust, tax, data privacy and security, intellectual property, employment and other matters. See Note 16 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of certain matters. The outcome of these matters and other litigation and proceedings is subject to significant uncertainty, and it is possible that an adverse resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm and/or significant monetary damages, injunctive relief or settlement costs that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition as well as the Company\u2019s ability to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted. In addition, regardless of merit or outcome, such proceedings can have an adverse impact on the Company as a result of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel and other factors.\nThe Company\u2019s Business Could Be Adversely Impacted by Changes in Law, Governmental Policy and Regulation.\nVarious aspects of the Company\u2019s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world, and the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the Company\u2019s products and services are produced or distributed, and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries, could have a negative impact on its interests. For example, the Company\u2019s Australian operating businesses may be adversely affected by changes in government policy, regulation or legislation, or the application or enforcement thereof, applying to companies in the Australian media industry or to Australian companies in general. See \u201cGovernmental Regulation-Australian Media Regulation\u201d for more information. In addition, the Company\u2019s newspaper publishing businesses in the U.K. are subject to greater regulation and oversight as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the Leveson inquiry into the U.K. press, and the Company\u2019s radio stations in the U.K. and Ireland are subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities. See \u201cGovernmental Regulation-U.K. Press Regulation\u201d and \u201c-U.K. Radio Broadcasting Regulation,\u201d respectively, for more information. Laws and regulations may vary between local, state, federal and international jurisdictions, and the enforcement of those laws and regulations may be inconsistent and unpredictable. The Company may incur substantial costs or be required to change its business practices in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations and could incur substantial penalties or other liabilities in the event of any failure to comply.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nTheft of the Company\u2019s Content, including Digital Piracy and Signal Theft, may Decrease Revenue and Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business and Profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends in part on its ability to maintain and monetize the intellectual property rights in its content, and theft of its brands, programming, digital content, books and other copyrighted material affects the value of its content. Developments in technology, including the wide availability of higher internet bandwidth and reduced storage costs, increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to stream, duplicate and widely distribute pirated material, including from other less-regulated countries into the Company\u2019s primary markets. The Company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy by, among other means, preventing unauthorized access to its content through the use of programming content encryption, signal encryption and other security access devices and digital rights management software, as well as by obtaining site blocking orders against pirate streaming and torrent sites and a variety of other actions. However, these efforts may be costly and are not always successful, particularly as infringers continue to develop tools that undermine security features and enable them to disguise their identities online. The proliferation of unauthorized use of the Company\u2019s content undermines lawful distribution channels and reduces the revenue that the Company could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its content. Protection of the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of its rights as defined by applicable laws in the U.S. and abroad, and if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the Company\u2019s rights, or if existing laws are changed or not effectively enforced, the Company\u2019s ability to generate revenue from its intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. In addition, the failure of legal and technological protections to evolve as piracy and associated technological tools become more sophisticated could make it more difficult for the Company to adequately protect its intellectual property, which could, in turn, negatively impact its value and further increase the Company\u2019s enforcement costs.\nFailure by the Company to Protect Certain Intellectual Property and Brands, or Infringement Claims by Third Parties, Could Adversely Impact the Company\u2019s Business, Results of Operation and Financial Condition.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses rely on a combination of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade secrets and other proprietary rights, as well as licenses, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements, to establish, obtain and protect the intellectual property and brand names used in their businesses. The Company believes its proprietary trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are important to its continued success and its competitive position. However, the Company cannot ensure that these intellectual property rights or those of its licensors (including licenses relating to sports programming rights, set-top box technology and related systems, the NAR License and the Fox Licenses) and suppliers will be enforced or upheld if challenged or that these rights will protect the Company against infringement claims by third parties, and effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country or region in which the Company operates or where its products and services are available. Efforts to protect and enforce the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights may be costly, and any failure by the Company or its licensors and suppliers to effectively protect and enforce its or their intellectual property or brands, or any infringement claims by third parties, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition. Claims of intellectual property infringement could require the Company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms (if such agreements are available at all), require the Company to spend substantial sums to defend against or settle such claims or to satisfy any judgment rendered against it, or cease any further use of the applicable intellectual property, which could in turn require the\nCompany to change its business practices or offerings and limit its ability to compete effectively. Even if the Company believes any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from its business. In addition, the Company may be contractually required to indemnify other parties against liabilities arising out of any third party infringement claims.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nThe Market Price of the Company\u2019s Stock May Fluctuate Significantly.\nThe Company cannot predict the prices at which its common stock may trade. The market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may fluctuate significantly, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond its control, including: (1) the Company\u2019s quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in its industry; (2) actual or anticipated fluctuations in the Company\u2019s operating results; (3) success or failure of the Company\u2019s business strategy; (4) the Company\u2019s ability to obtain financing as needed; (5) changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; (6) changes in laws and regulations affecting the Company\u2019s business; (7) announcements by the Company or its competitors of significant new business developments or the addition or loss of significant customers; (8) announcements by the Company or its competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; (9) changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or the Company\u2019s ability to meet its earnings guidance, if any; (10) the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies; (11) investor perception of the Company and the industries in which it operates; (12) results from material litigation or governmental investigations; (13) changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; (14) overall market fluctuations and general economic conditions; and (15) changes in the amounts and frequency of dividends or share repurchases, if any.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s Directors and Officers May Have Actual or Potential Conflicts of Interest Because of Their Equity Ownership in Fox Corporation (\u201cFOX\u201d) and/or Because They Also Serve as Officers and/or on the Board of Directors of FOX, Which May Result in the Diversion of Certain Corporate Opportunities to FOX.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers own shares of FOX\u2019s common stock, and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets. In addition, certain of the Company\u2019s officers and directors also serve as officers and/or as directors of FOX, including K. Rupert Murdoch, who serves as the Company\u2019s Executive Chairman and Chairman of FOX, and Lachlan K. Murdoch, who serves as the Company\u2019s Co-Chairman and Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of FOX. This ownership or service to both companies may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the Company and FOX. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between the Company and FOX regarding the terms of the agreements governing the indemnification of certain matters. In addition to any other arrangements that the Company and FOX may agree to implement, the Company and FOX agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies.\nThe Company\u2019s Amended and Restated By-laws acknowledge that the Company\u2019s directors and officers, as well as certain of its stockholders, including K. Rupert Murdoch, certain members of his family and certain family trusts (so long as such persons continue to own, in the aggregate, 10% or more of the voting stock of each of the Company and FOX), each of which is referred to as a covered stockholder, are or may become stockholders, directors, officers, employees or agents of FOX and certain of its affiliates. The Company\u2019s Amended and Restated By-laws further provide that any such overlapping person will not be liable to the Company, or to any of its stockholders, for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity (other than certain types of restricted business opportunities set forth in the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated By-laws) to FOX instead of the Company. This could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities other than restricted business opportunities to FOX instead of the Company.\nCertain Provisions of the Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws, the Company\u2019s Fourth Amended and Restated Stockholder Rights Agreement and the Ownership of the Company\u2019s Common Stock by the Murdoch Family Trust May Discourage Takeovers, and the Concentration of Ownership Will Affect the Voting Results of Matters Submitted for Stockholder Approval.\nThe Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws contain certain anti-takeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer, change in control, or takeover attempt that is opposed by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting stock. In particular, the Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws provide for, among other things:\n\u2022a dual class common equity capital structure;\n\u2022a prohibition on stockholders taking any action by written consent without a meeting;\n\u2022special stockholders\u2019 meeting to be called only by the Board of Directors, the Chairman or a Vice or Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors, or the holders of not less than 20% of the voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting stock;\n\u2022the requirement that stockholders give the Company advance notice to nominate candidates for election to the Board of Directors or to make stockholder proposals at a stockholders\u2019 meeting;\n\u2022the requirement of an affirmative vote of at least 65% of the voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting stock to amend or repeal its by-laws;\n\u2022vacancies on the Board of Directors to be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022certain restrictions on the transfer of the Company\u2019s shares; and\n\u2022the Board of Directors to issue, without stockholder approval, Preferred Stock and Series Common Stock with such terms as the Board of Directors may determine.\nThese provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals, if effective, desirable.\nIn addition, in connection with the Separation, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights agreement, which it extended in June 2014, June 2015, June 2018 and again in June 2021. Pursuant to the fourth amended and restated stockholder rights agreement, each outstanding share of the Company\u2019s common stock has attached to it a right entitling its holder to purchase from the Company additional shares of its Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock in the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the then-outstanding Class B Common Stock without approval of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, subject to exceptions for persons beneficially owning 15% or more of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock immediately following the Separation. The stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire the Company\u2019s voting common stock without the approval of its Board of Directors. The rights expire on June 18, 2022, except as otherwise provided in the rights agreement. Further, as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the Murdoch Family Trust, which beneficially owns less than one percent of the Company\u2019s outstanding Class A Common Stock and approximately 38.4% of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock as of June 30, 2021, K. Rupert Murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the Murdoch Family Trust. K. Rupert Murdoch, however, disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares. Also, K. Rupert Murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional one percent of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock and less than one percent of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock as of June 30, 2021. Thus, K. Rupert Murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate less than one percent of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and approximately 39.4% of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock as of June 30, 2021. This concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of the Company. Additionally, the ownership concentration of Class B Common Stock by the Murdoch Family Trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the Murdoch Family Trust will be adopted and proposals that the Murdoch Family Trust does not support will not be adopted, whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of Class B Common Stock. Furthermore, the adoption of the fourth amended and restated stockholder rights agreement will prevent, unless the Company\u2019s Board of Directors otherwise determines at the time, other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock and, accordingly, could prevent a meaningful challenge to the Murdoch Family Trust\u2019s influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval.", "PERMNO": 13964, "SIC": 2711, "TIC": "NWSA"}
