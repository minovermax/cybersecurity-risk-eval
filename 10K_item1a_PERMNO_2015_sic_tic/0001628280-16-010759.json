RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors that may affect our business, including our financial condition and results of operations. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business could be harmed, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in us.\nCompetitive pressures could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Redbox business faces competition from many other sources, including those using other distribution channels, having more experience, larger or more appealing inventory, better financing, and better relationships with those in the movie and video game industries, including:\n\u2022\nmail-delivery and online content providers, such as Netflix, Hulu, iTunes or Amazon;\n\u2022\ncable, satellite, and telecommunications providers, such as Comcast or DISH Network;\n\u2022\ntraditional movie programmers, such as HBO or Showtime;\n\u2022\ntraditional brick and mortar video retailers, and other DVD kiosk businesses;\n\u2022\nother retailers such as Walmart and other chain stores selling DVDs and video games;\n\u2022\nvideo game rental providers, such as GameFly;\n\u2022\nnoncommercial sources such as libraries; and\n\u2022\ngeneral competition from other forms of entertainment, such as movie theaters, television and sporting events.\nOur Coinstar business faces competition from supermarkets, banks and other companies that obtain coin-counting equipment from companies such as ScanCoin, Cummins-Allison Corporation and others. Our retailers may choose to replace our coin-counting kiosks with competitor machines and operate such kiosks themselves or through a third party, or not carry coin-counting kiosks at all, deciding that floor space could be used for other purposes. In addition, retailers, some of which have significantly more resources than we do, may decide to enter the coin-counting market independently. Some banks and other competitors already provide coin-counting free of charge or for an amount that yields very low margins or that may not generate a profit at all. An expansion of the coin-counting services provided or a reduction in related fees charged by any of these competitors or retailer decisions to use floor space for other than coin-counting, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur ecoATM business, including its Gazelle brand, faces competition from companies whose primary business consists of the purchase of used electronics, including online retailers and websites, as well as brick and mortar stores that buy back used electronics. The business also faces competition from companies in other businesses that also have buyback or leasing programs, such as GameStop, Best Buy, Target, Apple, AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint. These competitors may have significantly more resources than we do or offer their customers a higher price or more convenient offering than we do for the same item. Both the proliferation of such programs and the perceived value to consumers provided by such programs could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThere are many risks related to our Redbox business that may negatively impact our business.\nThe home video industry is highly competitive with many factors affecting our ability to profitably manage our Redbox business. We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, to maintain our infrastructure of Redbox kiosks in the United States. Now that we have substantially completed our U.S. build-out of Redbox kiosks, optimizing our Redbox business in the United States will depend substantially upon growth or minimizing decline in same store sales. In addition, the home video distribution market is rapidly evolving as newer technologies and distribution channels compete for market share, and we have experienced a secular decline in the physical rental market. As it continues, our business, operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected. Some additional risks that could negatively impact our results include:\n\u2022\nIncreased availability of digital movie content and changes in consumer content delivery and viewing options and preferences, including increased use of online streaming, video-on-demand, subscription video-on-demand and time- and place-shifting technologies;\n\u2022\nIncreased availability and quality of original programming and similar episodic content, and exclusive arrangements with programmers, such as HBO, Showtime, and Netflix.\n\u2022\nDecreased quantity and quality of movie content availability for DVD distribution due to changes in quantity of new releases by studios, a trend towards developing more high-budget \"event\" or \"blockbuster\" movies, movie content failing to appeal to consumers\u2019 tastes, increased focus on digital sales and rentals, and other general industry-related factors, including financial disruptions, and labor conflicts;\n\u2022\nDue to arrangements with certain studios that provide content on a delayed basis, the availability of some new releases in our kiosks may shift to times when consumers are relatively less likely to rent movies, or may be in genres that are off seasonally, such as a holiday movie unavailable until January; and\n\u2022\nDecreased costs for consumers to purchase or receive movie content, including less expensive DVDs, more aggressive competitor pricing strategies and piracy.\nAs a result, we expect our Redbox business results to continue to decline over time. Further, any additional adverse developments relating to any of these risks, as well as others relating to our participation in the home video industry, could significantly affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe termination, non-renewal or renegotiation on materially adverse terms of our contracts or relationships with one or more of our significant retailers, studios or game publishers could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our business depends in large part on our ability to maintain contractual relationships with our partners in profitable locations. Certain contract provisions with our partners vary, including product and service offerings, the service fees we are committed to pay, and the ability to cancel the contract upon notice after a certain period of time. For Redbox and Coinstar, we typically enter multi-year kiosk installation agreements that automatically renew until we, or the retailer, gives notice of termination. Our typical ecoATM agreements allow retailers and mall operators to terminate for convenience with minimal notice. We strive to provide direct and indirect benefits to our partners that are superior to, or competitive with, other providers or systems or alternative uses of the floor space that our kiosks occupy. If we are unable to provide them with adequate benefits, we may be unable to maintain or renew our contractual relationships on acceptable terms, causing our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer.\nCertain retailers account for a substantial amount of our business. For example, we have significant relationships with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Walgreen Co., and The Kroger Company, which accounted for approximately 16.6%, 13.4%, and 9.8% of our consolidated revenue from continuing operations, respectively, during 2015. Although we have had, and expect to continue to have, a successful relationship with these partners, changes will continue to occur both in the short- and long-term, some of which could adversely affect our business and reputation. For example, our Redbox, Coinstar and ecoATM relationship with Walmart is governed by contracts that provide either party the right to terminate the contracts in their entirety, or as to any store serviced by the contracts, with or without cause, on as little as 90 days\u2019 notice. Cancellation, adverse renegotiation of or other changes to these relationships could seriously harm our business and reputation.\nOur business also depends on our ability to obtain adequate content from movie studios and video game publishers. We have entered into licensing agreements with certain studios to provide delivery of their DVDs by the \u201cstreet date,\u201d the first date on which DVD releases are available to the general public for home entertainment purposes on either a rental or sell-through basis. In addition, we have licensing arrangements with other studios that make DVDs available for rent 28 days after the street date. If we are unable to maintain or renew our current relationships to obtain movie or video game content on acceptable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nOur inability to receive delivery of DVDs on the date of their initial release to the general public, or shortly thereafter, for home entertainment viewing could adversely affect our Redbox business.\nTraditionally, businesses that rented movies in physical formats, such as DVDs, had enjoyed a competitive advantage over other movie distribution rental channels. After the initial theatrical release of a movie, the major studios generally had made their movies available on physical formats for a 30- to 45-day release window before release to other movie distribution rental channels, such as pay-per view, video-on-demand, premium television, basic cable, and network and syndicated television.\nHowever, movie studios are experimenting with this model, including shortening or discontinuing altogether, or otherwise restricting, movie distribution windows, including making video-on-demand or other digital delivery methods available prior to, or simultaneous with, the physical DVD release. For example, certain movie studios have made new release titles available on video-on-demand or for online purchase on the same date as the DVD release, and certain movies have been made available via premium video-on-demand while they are still in theaters. Further, some studios have implemented restrictions on renting DVDs for weeks following the initial release of the same title for purchase. For example, Redbox has entered into arrangements with certain studios that include delayed rental windows. Entering into these studio licensing arrangements that contain a delayed rental window may decrease consumer satisfaction and consumer demand, and we may lose consumers to our competitors that offer access to titles without a delayed window. In addition, studios may seek to impose longer delays, or\nstudios that currently provide content on the street date may seek similar delays. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we do not manage our content library effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nA critical element of our Redbox business model is to optimize our library of DVD titles, formats, and copy depth to achieve satisfactory availability rates to meet consumer demand while also maximizing margins. If we do not timely acquire sufficient DVD titles, due to, for example, not correctly anticipating demand, intentionally acquiring fewer copies than needed to fully satisfy demand or the lack of available titles, we may not appropriately satisfy consumer demand, which could decrease consumer satisfaction and we could lose consumers to competitors. Conversely, if we attempt to mitigate this risk and acquire a larger number of copies to achieve higher availability rates for select titles or a wider range of titles, our library utilization would become less efficient and our margins for the Redbox business would be adversely affected, such as what occurred in the fourth quarter of 2015 when we purchased additional content to encourage consumers to return to normal rental patterns. Our ability to accurately predict consumer demand as well as market factors, such as our ability to obtain satisfactory distribution arrangements, may impact our ability to timely acquire appropriate quantities of certain DVD titles. In addition, if we are unable to obtain or maintain favorable terms from our suppliers with respect to such matters as timely movie access, copy depth, formats and product destruction, among others, or if the price of DVDs increases or decreases generally or for certain titles, our library may become unbalanced and our margins may be adversely affected.\nFurther, the delay in our ability to rent certain studios\u2019 DVD titles pursuant to a delayed rental window may negatively affect consumer satisfaction and demand, and we could lose consumers to our competitors because of the timing of our library.\nWe have entered into licensing agreements with certain studios to allow rental of their titles on the \u201cstreet date,\u201d and with other studios to make DVDs available for rent 28 days or more after the street date. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if these agreements do not provide the expected benefits to us. For example, agreements may require us to license minimum quantities of theatrical and direct-to-video DVDs for rental at our kiosks. If the titles or format provided are not attractive to our consumers, we could be required to purchase too many copies of undesirable titles or an undesirable format, possibly in substantial amounts, which could adversely affect our Redbox business by decreasing consumer demand for offered DVD titles and consumer satisfaction with our services or negatively impacting margins. If studios that do not have a delayed rental window elect to delay the general release of DVDs to the rental market for significant periods after they are released for retail sales, demand for rental of these titles may be adversely affected. In addition, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, additional non-cash increases to operating expenses, which are amortized over the terms of any such arrangements, that also could have a dilutive impact on our stockholders, such as the issuance of equity under certain of our existing studio contracts or to the extent we enter into similar arrangements with other movie studios in the future. Further, if some or all of these agreements prove beneficial but are early terminated, we could be negatively impacted. Moreover, if we cannot maintain similar arrangements in the future with these or other studios or distributors, or these arrangements do not provide the expected benefits to us, our business could suffer.\nIn addition, if we are unable to comply with, or lack the necessary internal controls to ensure appropriate documentation and tracking of our content library, we may, among other things, violate certain of our studio licensing arrangements, be forced to pay a fee for unaccounted for DVDs and be susceptible to risks of theft and misuse of property, any of which may negatively affect our margins in the Redbox business. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDefects, failures or security breaches in and inadequate upgrades of, or changes to, our operating systems could harm our business.\nThe operation of our business depends on sophisticated software, hardware, and computer networking and communication services that may contain undetected errors or may be subject to failures or complications. These errors, failures or complications may arise particularly when new, changed or enhanced products or services are added. In the past, there have been limited delays and disruptions resulting from upgrading or improving these operating systems. Future upgrades, improvements or changes that may be necessary to expand and maintain our business could result in delays or disruptions or may not be timely or appropriately made, any of which could seriously harm our operations.\nFurther, certain aspects of the operating systems relating to our business are provided by third parties, including telecommunications. Accordingly, the effectiveness of these operating systems is, to a certain degree, dependent on the actions and decisions of third parties over whom we may have limited control.\nFailure to adequately comply with privacy notices, information security policies, standards or legal requirements or to adequately safeguard against breaches of such policies, standards or requirements could adversely affect our operations and could damage our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations.\nAs our business expands to provide new products and services, such as ecoATM, including its Gazelle brand, Coinstar Exchange, and as we continue our efforts to enhance the Redbox customer experience, we are increasing the amount of consumer data that we collect, transfer, retain and use as part of our business. These activities are subject to laws and regulations, as well as industry standards, in the United States and other jurisdictions in which our products and services are or may be made available. These requirements, which often differ materially and sometimes conflict among the many jurisdictions in which we operate, are designed to protect the privacy of consumers\u2019 personal information and to prevent that information from being inappropriately collected, used or disclosed. We maintain and review technical and operational safeguards designed to protect this information and generally require third party vendors and others with whom we work to do so as well. However, despite those safeguards, it is possible that hackers, employees acting contrary to our policies, third-party agents or others could improperly access relevant systems or improperly obtain or disclose data about our consumers, or that we may be determined not to be in compliance with applicable legal requirements and industry standards for data use and security, such as the Payment Card Industry guidelines. A breach or purported breach of relevant use and security policies or controls that compromises consumer data or determination of non-compliance with applicable legal requirements, privacy notices or industry standards for data use and security could expose us to regulatory enforcement actions, civil litigation, card association or other monetary fines or sanctions, or contractual liabilities, limit our ability to provide our products and services, subject us to legal action and related costs and damage our business reputation, financial position, and results of operations.\nOur failure to meet consumer expectations with respect to pricing our products and services may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nDemand for our products and services may be sensitive to pricing changes. We evaluate and update our pricing strategies from time to time, and changes we institute may have a significant impact on, among other things, our revenue and net income. For example, in December 2014 the rental price for DVDs increased by 30 cents to $1.50 a day, the price for Blu-ray Discs increased by 50 cents to $2.00 a day, and in January 2015, the rental price for video games increased by $1.00 to $3.00 a day. In the future, other fee increases or pricing changes may deter consumers from using our kiosks or reduce the frequency of their usage.\nPayment of increased fees to retailers or other third party service providers could negatively affect our business results.\nWe face ongoing pricing pressure from our retailers to increase the service fees we pay to them on our products and services or to make other financial concessions to win or retain their business. If we are unable to respond effectively to ongoing pricing-related pressures, we may fail to win or retain certain accounts. Our fee arrangements are based on our evaluation of unique factors with each retailer, such as total revenue, long-term, non-cancelable contracts, installation of our kiosks in high-traffic, geographic locations and new product and service commitments. Together with other factors, an increase in service fees paid, or other financial concessions made to our retailers could significantly increase our direct operating expenses in future periods and harm our business. In addition, we accept payment for movie and game rentals through debit and credit card transactions. For these payments, we pay interchange and other fees, which have increased and may increase further over time. Further, because Redbox processes millions of small dollar amount transactions, and interchange fees represent a larger percentage of card processing costs compared to a typical retailer, we are relatively more susceptible to any fee increase. When interchange or other fees increase, it generally raises our operating costs and lowers our profit margins or requires that we charge our customers more for our products and services.\nWe may be unable to attract new partners, broaden current partner relationships, and penetrate new markets and distribution channels.\nTo increase the availability of our products and services, we need to attract new partners, broaden relationships with current partners, and develop operational efficiencies that make it feasible for us to penetrate lower density markets or new distribution channels, such as Coinstar kiosks in banks and credit unions and the direct-to-consumer channel through Gazelle. We may be unable to attract new retailers or drive down costs relating to the manufacture, installation or servicing of our kiosks to levels that would enable us to operate profitably in lower density markets or penetrate new distribution channels. If we are unable to do so, our future business and financial performance could be adversely affected.\nOur future operating results may fluctuate.\nOur future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to continue to drive new and repeat use of our Redbox and Coinstar kiosks, our ability to develop and commercialize new products and services, such as ecoATM and Coinstar Exchange, and the costs incurred to do so, and our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions, such as Gazelle, and other third-party relationships into our operations. Our operating results have a history of fluctuating and may continue to fluctuate based upon many factors, including fluctuations in revenue generated by and operating expenses incurred by our different lines of business, seasonality, the timing of the release slate and the relative attractiveness of the titles available for rent in a particular quarter or year which may have lingering effects in subsequent periods, fluctuations in consumer rental patterns, including the number of movies rented per visit, the type of DVDs they want to rent and for how long, the effects of legacy contracts with minimum purchase requirements, and the level of DVD migration between kiosks.\nWe have experienced seasonality in our revenue from our Redbox segment. December and the summer months have historically been high rental months. April has been a low rental month due, in part, to retail release timing in connection with the Academy Awards and the Easter holiday that historically has provided stronger content and resulted in higher rentals in March. September and October have been low rental months, due, in part, to the beginning of the school year and the introduction of the new fall television season. By entering into licensing agreements with certain studios that contain delayed rental windows, the availability of titles affected has shifted relative to historic patterns. Seasonal effects, however, may be minimized or increased by the actual release slate, the relative attractiveness of movie titles, and the total box office in a particular quarter or year which may have lingering effects in subsequent periods. Significant recurring events that compete with customer interest for movie content such as the Olympics also have a negative impact on revenue from our Redbox segment. They create competition and affect retail timing, which aims to avoid such events that compete with viewing interest. New video game content releases are concentrated in the fourth quarter due to publisher release schedules and typically drive higher revenue in the fourth quarter.\nOur Coinstar segment generally experiences its highest revenue in the second half of the year due to increased retailer foot traffic and holiday shopping in the fourth quarter, along with an increase in consumers\u2019 desire for disposable income in the summer months.\nIn our ecoATM segment, kiosk transactions generally peak during the summer months, decline in the fourth quarter and remain flat into the following quarter before increasing in early March. Transactions can be significantly impacted by the timing of new phone releases.\nIf we cannot manage our business effectively, we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have experienced periods of substantial change in our business, particularly due to Redbox, and more recently, the acquisition of ecoATM and Gazelle. These changes have placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our operational, financial and administrative infrastructure and our management. As our operations have grown in size, scope and complexity, we have focused on integrating, improving and upgrading our systems and infrastructure related to providing attractive and efficient consumer products and services, and our administration and internal systems, processes and controls. For example, management has had to adapt to and provide oversight for an increasingly decentralized organization as Redbox and ecoATM operations have remained primarily in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois, and San Diego, California, respectively, while Outerwall\u2019s corporate headquarters and Coinstar operations have remained in Bellevue, Washington. This integration and expansion of our administration, processes, systems and infrastructure have required us to commit, and may continue to cause us to commit, substantial financial, operational and technical resources to managing our business.\nAlthough we believe the total addressable market for automated kiosks is large, we cannot be certain about its size, the most effective plan for locating kiosks, or the optimum market density. Because the kiosk market and our business model are continually evolving, we have incomplete data and track records for predicting kiosk and market performance in future periods. As a result, we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, we may, among other things, over-install kiosks in certain geographic areas leading to non-accretive installations, and we cannot be certain that historical revenue ramps for new kiosks will be sustainable in the future.\nManaging our business changes will require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management and operational resources. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization, including effectively evolving and growing our business lines, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nIf we cannot execute on our strategy and offer new retail products and services, our business could suffer.\nOur strategy is based upon leveraging our core competencies in the retail space to provide the consumer with convenience and value and to help retailers drive incremental traffic and revenue. To be competitive, we need to offer new product and service offerings that are accepted by the market and establish third-party relationships necessary to develop and commercialize such product and service offerings. We are exploring new businesses to enter, and new products and services to offer, however, the complexities and structures of these new businesses and products could create conflicting priorities, constrain limited resources, and negatively impact our core businesses. We may use our financial resources and management\u2019s time and focus to invest in other companies offering retail services, such as our acquisition of ecoATM, we may seek to grow businesses organically, or we may seek to offer new products or services on our current kiosks, such as Coinstar Exchange gift card exchange. We may enter into joint ventures through which we may expand our product and service offerings. Any new business opportunity also may have its own unique risks related to operations, finances, intellectual property, technology, legal and regulatory issues, corporate governance or other challenges, for which we may have limited or no prior experience. In addition, if we fail to timely establish or maintain relationships with significant retailers and suppliers, we may not be able to provide our consumers with desirable new products and services. Further, to develop and commercialize certain new products and services, we will need to create new kiosks or enhance the capabilities of our current kiosks, as well as adapt our related networks and systems through appropriate technological solutions for a retail environment, and establish market acceptance of such products or services. We cannot assure you that new products or services that we provide will be successful or profitable.\nAcquisitions and investments involve risks that could harm our business and impair our ability to realize potential benefits from such acquisitions and investments.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have in the past sought, and may in the future seek, to acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies that we feel could complement or expand our business. For example, we acquired ecoATM in July 2013 and Gazelle in November 2015. However, we may be unable to adequately address the financial, legal and operational risks raised by such acquisitions or investments and may not successfully integrate these acquisitions or investments, which could harm our business and prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of the acquisitions and investments. In addition, we may not have the right or power to direct the management or policies of companies we have invested in. Further, the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions and investments, as well as the integration of acquired businesses, divert management time and other resources. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any particular transaction, even if successfully completed, will ultimately benefit our business. Certain financial and operational risks related to acquisitions and investments that may have a material impact on our business are:\n\u2022\nthe assumption of known and unknown liabilities of an acquired company, including employee and intellectual property claims and other violations of applicable law;\n\u2022\nlosses related to acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022\nmanaging relationships with other investors and the companies in which we have made investments, including, in some cases, as minority partner;\n\u2022\nreduced liquidity, including through the use of cash resources and incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities in funding acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022\nentrance into markets in which we have no direct prior experience, and where we face competition from many other companies, including those having more experience, better financing, or better relationships with others in the industry than we have;\n\u2022\nimpairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets arising from our arrangements and investments;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and expenses in assimilating the operations, products, technology, information systems or personnel of an acquired company, acquired assets or joint ventures;\n\u2022\ninability to efficiently divest unsuccessful acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022\nstockholder dilution if an acquisition is consummated through an issuance of our securities;\n\u2022\nimposition of restrictive covenants and increased debt service obligations that provide us less flexibility in how we operate our business to the extent we borrow to finance an acquisition or investment;\n\u2022\namortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets and other adverse accounting consequences;\n\u2022\ncosts incurred in identifying and performing due diligence on potential targets and negotiating agreements that may or may not be successful, including payment of break-up fees if transactions are not closed; and\n\u2022\nimpairment of relationships with employees, retailers and affiliates of our business and the acquired business.\nWe depend upon third-party manufacturers, suppliers and service providers for key components and substantial support for our kiosks.\nWe conduct limited manufacturing operations and depend on outside parties to manufacture key components of our kiosks. We intend to continue to expand our installed base of kiosks. Such expansion may be limited by the manufacturing capacity of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers. Third-party manufacturers may not be able to meet our manufacturing needs in a satisfactory and timely manner. If there is an unanticipated increase in demand for our kiosks or our manufacturing needs are not met in a timely and satisfactory manner, we may be unable to meet demand due to manufacturing limitations.\nSome key hardware components used in our kiosks are obtained from a limited number of suppliers. We may be unable to continue to obtain an adequate supply of these components from our suppliers in a timely manner or, if necessary, from alternative sources. If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of components from our current suppliers or locate alternative sources of supply on a timely basis, we may experience delays in installing or maintaining our kiosks, either of which could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we rely on third-party service providers for substantial support and service efforts that we currently do not provide directly. In particular, we contract with third-party providers to arrange for pick-up, processing and depositing of coins, as well as to provide limited servicing of our kiosks. We generally contract with a single transportation provider and coin processor to service a particular region. We do not currently have, nor do we expect to have in the foreseeable future, the internal capability to provide back-up coin processing service in the event of a sudden disruption in service from a commercial coin processor. Any failure by us to maintain our existing coin processing relationships or to establish new relationships on a timely basis or on acceptable terms could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are risks associated with conducting our business and sourcing goods internationally.\nWe currently have Coinstar operations in Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland. We expect to continue our deployment of kiosks internationally. Accordingly, political uncertainties, economic changes, exchange rate fluctuations, restrictions on the repatriation of funds, adverse changes in legal requirements, including tax, tariff and trade regulations, difficulties with foreign distributors, operating challenges and other difficulties in managing an organization outside the U.S., could seriously harm the development of our business and ability to operate profitably. For example, in January 2015, we made the decision to shut down our Redbox operations in Canada as the business was not meeting the company's performance expectations. Further, as we do more business in an increasing number of countries, our business becomes more exposed to the impact of the political and economic uncertainties, including government oversight, of foreign jurisdictions.\nWe purchase products from vendors that obtain a significant percentage of such products from foreign manufacturers. As a result, we are subject to changes in governmental policies, exchange rate fluctuations, various product quality standards, the imposition of tariffs, import and export controls, transportation delays and interruptions and political and economic disruptions which could disrupt the supply and timely delivery of products manufactured abroad. In addition, we could be affected by labor strikes in the sea shipping, trucking and railroad industries. A reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of one or more supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to substantial federal, state, local and foreign laws and government regulation specific to our business.\nOur business is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and government regulation, including those relating to copyright law, access to kiosks in public places, consumer privacy and protection, data protection and information security, taxes, secondhand dealers, vehicle safety, charitable fundraising, the transfer of money or things of value, coins, currency controls, weights and measures, payment cards and other payment instruments, sweepstakes, and contests. The application of existing laws and regulations, changes in laws or enactment of new laws and regulations, that apply, or may in the future apply, to our current or future products or services, changes in governmental authorities\u2019 interpretation of the application of various government regulations to our business, or the failure or inability to gain and retain required permits and approvals could materially and adversely affect our business. For example, if the U.S. government was to pass laws or adopt regulations to phase out certain coins, as previously happened with the penny in Canada, it could have a material and adverse effect on our Coinstar business.\nIn addition, many jurisdictions require us to obtain certain licenses in connection with the operations of our businesses. There can be no assurance that we will be granted all necessary licenses or permits in the future, that current licenses or permits will be renewed or that regulators will not revoke current licenses or permits. Given the unique nature of our business and new products and services we may develop or acquire in the future, the application of various laws and regulations to our business is uncertain. Further, as governmental and regulatory scrutiny and action with regard to many aspects of our business increase, we expect that our costs of complying with the applicable legal requirements may increase, perhaps substantially.\nIn many jurisdictions, ecoATM is subject to secondhand dealer laws that regulate the purchase of used goods, such as the phones it purchases from consumers at kiosks. Such laws contain requirements, or laws may be amended or enacted to create requirements, with which we cannot comply, thus requiring us to cease operations in certain jurisdictions. Moreover, a few legislatures have in the past enacted laws which directly restrict or prohibit businesses like ecoATM, and potentially Coinstar Exchange, from operating. If additional similar laws are enacted at either the state or local level, or if existing laws are held to apply to our businesses, our ability to operate may be adversely impacted, thereby damaging our business and results of operations.\nAlso, if U.S. copyright law were altered to amend or eliminate the First Sale Doctrine, our business could be adversely affected. Under U.S. copyright law, the First Sale Doctrine provides that once a copyright owner sells a copy of his work, the copyright owner relinquishes all further rights to sell or otherwise dispose of that copy. While the copyright owner retains the underlying copyright to the expression fixed in the work, the copyright owner gives up his ability to control the fate of the work once sold. As such, once we purchase a DVD in the market, we are permitted to re-sell it, rent it or otherwise dispose of it. Although the majority of our content library is licensed directly from studios, and not purchased, if Congress or the courts were to change, or substantially limit, this First Sale Doctrine, our ability to obtain certain purchased content and then rent it could be adversely affected.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses or permits, loss of approved status, termination of contracts, administrative enforcement actions and fines, class action lawsuits, cease and desist orders and civil and criminal liability. The occurrence of one or more of these events, as well as the increased cost of compliance, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEvents outside of our control, including the economic environment, have negatively affected, and could continue to negatively affect, consumers\u2019 use of our products and services.\nOur consumers\u2019 use of many of our products and services is dependent on discretionary spending, which is affected by, among other things, economic and political conditions, consumer confidence, interest and tax rates, and financial and housing markets. With economic uncertainty still affecting potential consumers, we may be impacted by more conservative purchasing tendencies with fewer non-essential products and services purchases during the coming periods if the current economic environment continues. In addition, because our business relies in part on consumers initially visiting retailers to purchase products and services that are not necessarily our products and services, if consumers are visiting retailers less frequently and being more careful with their money when they do, these tendencies may also negatively impact our business.\nFurther, our ability to obtain additional funding in the future, if and as needed, through equity issuances or loans, or otherwise meet our current obligations to third parties, could be adversely affected if the economic environment continues to be difficult. In addition, the ability of third parties to honor their obligations to us could be negatively impacted, as retailers, suppliers and other parties deal with the difficult economic environment. Finally, there may be consequences that will ultimately result from the current economic conditions that are not yet known, and any one or more of these unknown consequences (as well as those currently being experienced) could potentially have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and liquidity, as well as our business generally.\nOur business can be adversely affected by severe weather, natural disasters and other events beyond our control, such as earthquakes, fires, power failures, telecommunication loss and terrorist attacks.\nA catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and our operating results. For example, our corporate headquarters and certain critical business operations are located in the Bellevue, Washington area, which is near major earthquake faults. While we have taken steps to protect the security of critical business processes and systems and have established certain back-up systems and disaster recovery procedures, any disruptions, whether due to inadequate back-up or disaster recovery planning, failures of information technology systems, interruptions in the communications network, or other factors, could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our operational and financial performance is a direct reflection of consumer use of and the ability to operate and service our kiosks used in our business. Severe weather, natural disasters and other events beyond our control can, for extended periods of time, significantly reduce consumer use of our products and services as well as interrupt the ability of our employees and third-party providers to operate and service our kiosks. For example, in October 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused disruptions to our normal operations in the impacted region for an extended period of time. In some cases, severe weather, natural disasters and other events beyond our control may result in extensive damage to, or destruction of, our infrastructure and equipment, including loss of kiosks used to provide our products and services, which losses may not be fully covered by insurance.\nOur business involves the movement of large sums of money, and, as a result, our business is particularly dependent on our ability to process and settle transactions accurately and efficiently.\nOur business involves the movement of large sums of money. Our Coinstar business requires the effective transfer of large sums of money between many different locations. Because we are responsible for large sums of money that often are substantially greater than the revenues generated, the success of our business particularly depends upon the efficient, secure, and error-free handling of the money. We rely on the ability of our employees and our operating systems and network to process these transactions in an efficient, uninterrupted and error-free manner. In the event of a breakdown, catastrophic event, security breach, improper operation or any other event impacting our systems or network or our vendors\u2019 systems or processes, or improper or other actions taken by employees, or third party vendors, we could suffer financial loss, loss of consumers, regulatory sanctions and damage to our reputation.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property or enforce our patents and other proprietary rights.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property and maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses and other intellectual property arrangements. We have over 100 U.S. and international patents. For example, we have patents regarding kiosk systems for DVD rentals, managing credits and security and inventory management related to our Redbox business, and patents regarding coin counting, kiosk networking, fraud avoidance and voucher authentication related to our Coinstar business. We also have patents and other rights in the United States, Canada and Europe related to our various kiosk technologies, including U.S. patents on kiosk systems for identifying and analyzing electronic devices relating to our ecoATM business. In addition, we may apply for or obtain (through development, acquisition or otherwise) additional patents regarding technologies used in our businesses.\nOur patents may not be held valid if challenged, our patent applications may not be issued, and other parties may claim rights in or ownership of our patents and other proprietary rights. Patents issued to us may be circumvented or fail to provide adequate protection of our technologies. Our competitors might independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies. Further, since patent terms are limited, other parties may begin practicing our patented technologies when our related patents expire.\nIn addition, certain parties may assert claims of patent infringement or misappropriation against us based on current or pending U.S. or foreign patents, copyrights or trade secrets, or contracts. If such claims were successful, our business could be harmed. Defending ourselves, our retailers or other third parties against these types of claims, regardless of their merits, or initiating litigation to enforce our rights, could require us to incur substantial costs, divert the attention of key personnel and result in an award of substantial damages. Parties making these types of claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block or impair our ability to provide our DVD, coin-counting or other products and services in the United States or abroad. If third parties have, or obtain, proprietary rights that our products or services infringe, we may be unable to obtain necessary licenses from others at a reasonable cost or at all. The failure to protect our intellectual property rights effectively or to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of others, as well as unfavorable rulings or settlements, could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation, arbitration, mediation, regulatory actions, investigations or other legal proceedings could result in material rulings, decisions, settlements, fines, penalties or publicity that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business has in the past been, is currently and may in the future continue to be, party to class actions, regulatory actions, investigations, arbitration, mediation and other legal proceedings. The outcome of such proceedings is often difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs, regulatory bodies or other parties may seek very large or indeterminate amounts of money from us or substantial restrictions on our business activities, and the results, including the magnitude, of lawsuits, actions, settlements, decisions and investigations may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend, settle or otherwise finalize lawsuits, regulatory actions, investigations, arbitrations, mediations or other legal proceedings may be significant and such proceedings may divert management\u2019s time. For example, in recent years we have been involved in consumer class action lawsuits, a securities class action and derivative lawsuit, and studio litigation, as well as other litigation in the ordinary course of business. In addition, there may be adverse publicity associated with any such developments that could decrease consumer acceptance of our products and services. As a result, litigation, arbitration, mediation, regulatory actions or investigations involving us or our affiliates may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of key personnel or the inability of replacements to quickly and successfully perform in their new roles could adversely affect our business.\nIn recent years, we have experienced significant changes in our senior management team, including changes in our CEO and the presidents of our business lines. Further changes in senior management could result in disruptions to our operations. If we lose or terminate the services of one or more of our current executives or key employees or if one or more of our current or former executives or key employees joins a competitor or otherwise leaves or competes with us, it could harm our business and our ability to successfully implement our business plan. Additionally, if we are unable to timely hire qualified replacements for our executive and other key positions, our ability to execute our business plan could be harmed. Even if we can timely hire qualified replacements, we would expect to experience operational disruptions and inefficiencies during any transition.\nOur stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile.\nOur stock price has fluctuated substantially since our initial public offering in July 1997. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2015, the closing price of our common stock ranged from $84.45 to $36.54 per share. Our stock price may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\noperating results below market expectations and changes in, or our failure to meet, financial estimates of securities analysts or our own guidance;\n\u2022\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results;\n\u2022\nthe termination, non-renewal or re-negotiation of one or more retailer, supplier, distributor, or other third-party relationships;\n\u2022\ntrends and fluctuations in the use of our different lines of business;\n\u2022\nchanges in management;\n\u2022\nacquisition, merger, investment and disposition activities;\n\u2022\nshare repurchases and dividends;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements regarding the establishment, modification or termination of relationships regarding the development of new or enhanced products and services;\n\u2022\nrelease of analyst reports;\n\u2022\nmix of our stockholders at a given time, including percentage holdings of institutional, activist or retail investors, and various actions that may be taken by our stockholders that could cause speculation or market perception relating to our stock that is inconsistent with the fundamentals or prospects of our business;\n\u2022\nthe level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock;\n\u2022\neconomic or other external factors, for example, those relating to the current economic environment and fluctuations in the trading price of stocks generally;\n\u2022\nineffective internal controls; and\n\u2022\nindustry developments.\nIn addition, the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also seriously harm the market price of our common stock.\nOur anti-takeover mechanisms may affect the price of our common stock and make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors.\nWe have implemented anti-takeover provisions that may discourage takeover attempts and depress the market price of our stock. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any acquirer of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. Furthermore, Washington law may impose additional restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any acquirer of 10% or more of our outstanding common stock. These provisions may make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors, even if the offer from a third party may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.\nOur obligations under our substantial debt could adversely affect our cash flow and business.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the total principal value of our outstanding debt, including capital leases, was $892.2 million. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences for you, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or investments or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate, placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting; and\n\u2022\nexposing us to variability in interest rates, as our borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at variable rates determined by prevailing interest rates and our leverage ratio.\nIf we are unable to meet our debt obligations, we could be forced to restructure or refinance such obligations, seek additional equity financing or sell assets, which we may not be able to do on satisfactory terms or at all. As a result, we could default on those obligations, which could prevent or impede us from fulfilling our obligations and adversely affect our business.\nTo service or repay our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness, including without limitation any payments required to be made to holders of the Senior Notes due 2021 (the \u201c2021 Notes\u201d), the Senior Notes due 2019 (the \u201c2019 Notes\u201d) or under our credit facility, and to fund our operations, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness when due or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, sell assets, reduce or delay capital expenditures, seek additional equity financing or seek other third-party financing to satisfy such obligations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our failure to fund indebtedness obligations at any time could constitute an event of default under the instruments governing such indebtedness, and could trigger a cross default under our other outstanding debt, which could result in an acceleration of such indebtedness.\nIf we do not comply with the covenants in the credit agreement that governs our credit facility and the indentures that govern the 2021 Notes and the 2019 Notes or otherwise default under them, we may not have the funds necessary to pay all of our indebtedness that could become due.\nThe credit agreement governing our credit facility and the indentures governing the 2021 Notes and our 2019 Notes will require us to comply with certain covenants that may limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. For example, our credit agreement prohibits us from incurring any additional indebtedness, except in specified circumstances, without lender approval. Further, our credit agreement restricts our ability to acquire and dispose of assets, engage in mergers or reorganizations, pay dividends or make investments or capital expenditures. Other restrictive covenants require that we meet a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio, each as defined in our credit agreement. A violation of any of these covenants could cause an event of default under our credit agreement, which could result in the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness.\nOur failure to comply with these covenants or others under our indentures could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness, which would adversely affect our financial health. We cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds to repay all the outstanding amounts, and any acceleration of amounts due under our credit agreement or the indentures governing our outstanding indebtedness likely would have a material adverse effect on us.", "PERMNO": 85173, "SIC": 3578, "TIC": "OUTR"}
