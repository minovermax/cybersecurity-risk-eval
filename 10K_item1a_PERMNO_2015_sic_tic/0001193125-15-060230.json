RISK FACTORS\nBusiness Risk Factors\nSupplier Concentration\nOur purchases from Carrier and its affiliates comprised 61% of all purchases made during 2014. Significant relationships currently exist with four of the seven major HVAC equipment manufacturers; and purchases from these equipment suppliers, including Carrier, comprised 76% of all purchases made in 2014. Given the significant concentration of our supply chain, particularly with Carrier, any significant interruption by any of the manufacturers or a termination of a distribution agreement could temporarily disrupt the operations of certain of our subsidiaries. Additionally, our operations are materially dependent upon the continued market acceptance and quality of these manufacturers\u2019 products and their ability to continue to manufacture products that are competitive and that comply with laws relating to environmental and efficiency standards. Our inability to obtain products from one or more of these manufacturers or a decline in market acceptance of these manufacturers\u2019 products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe maintain separate and distinct trade name distribution agreements with Carrier. These agreements provide us the use of various Carrier brand names and distribution rights for certain Carrier HVAC brands and products on an exclusive basis in specified territories. The trade name and distribution agreements are not subject to a stated term or expiration date.\nWe also maintain distribution agreements with our other key equipment suppliers, either on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis, for terms generally ranging from one to ten years. Certain of the distribution agreements contain provisions that restrict or limit the sale of competitive products in the markets served. Other than the markets where such restrictions and limitations may apply, we may distribute other manufacturers\u2019 lines of air conditioning or heating equipment.\nRisks Inherent in Acquisitions\nAs part of our strategy, we intend to pursue additional acquisitions of complementary businesses. If we complete future acquisitions and/or joint ventures, we may be required to incur or assume additional debt and/or issue additional shares of our common stock as consideration, which will dilute our existing shareholders\u2019 ownership interest in us and may affect our results of operations. Growth through acquisitions involves a number of risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe ability to identify and consummate transactions with complementary acquisition candidates;\n\u2022\nthe successful operation and/or integration of acquired companies;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other daily functions;\n\u2022\nissuance by us of equity securities that would dilute ownership of our existing shareholders;\n\u2022\nincurrence and/or assumption of significant debt and contingent liabilities; and\n\u2022\npossible loss of key employees and/or customer relationships of the acquired companies.\nIn addition, acquired companies may have liabilities that we failed, or were unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations. We cannot assure you that the indemnification granted to us by sellers of acquired companies will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to offset the possible liabilities associated with businesses or properties that we assume upon consummation of an acquisition. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to successfully manage the operational challenges and risks associated with, or resulting from, acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nCompetition\nWe operate in highly competitive environments. We compete with a number of distributors and also with several air conditioning and heating equipment manufacturers that distribute a significant portion of their products through their own distribution organizations in certain markets. Competition within any given geographic market is based upon product availability, customer service, price and quality. Competitive pressures or other factors could cause our products or services to lose market acceptance or result in significant price erosion, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations\nThe functional currency of our operations in Canada is the Canadian dollar, and the functional currency of our operations in Mexico is the U.S. dollar because the majority of our Mexican transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on transactions denominated in Canadian dollars and Mexican Pesos, and, therefore, could adversely affect our financial performance. Currently, we do not hold any derivative contracts that hedge our foreign currency translational exposure.\nSeasonality\nSales of residential central air conditioners, heating equipment and parts and supplies have historically been seasonal, resulting in fluctuations in our revenue from quarter to quarter. Furthermore, profitability can be impacted favorably or unfavorably based on the severity or mildness of weather patterns during summer or winter selling seasons. Demand related to the residential central air conditioning replacement market is typically highest in the second and third quarters, and demand for heating equipment is usually highest in the fourth quarter. Demand related to the new construction sectors throughout most of the markets is fairly even during the year except for dependence on housing completions and related weather and economic conditions.\nDependence on Key Personnel\nMuch of our success has depended on the skills, experience and services of senior management personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business. We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and other employees sufficiently in order to both maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Our success has also substantially depended on the contributions and abilities of our store employees whom we rely on to give customers a superior in-store experience. Accordingly, our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work in and manage our stores. If we are unable to recruit, retain and motivate employees sufficiently in order to maintain our current business and support our projected growth and expansion, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected.\nDecline in Economic Conditions\nWe rely predominantly on the credit markets and, to a lesser extent, on the capital markets to meet our financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from our operations. Our access to funds under our line of credit is dependent on the ability of the syndicate banks to meet their respective funding commitments. Disruptions in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our line of credit and may also affect the determination of certain interest rates, particularly rates based on LIBOR, which is one of the base rates under our line of credit. Any disruptions in these markets could result in increased borrowing costs and/or reduced borrowing capacity under our line of credit. Any long-term disruption could require that we take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged. Such measures could include reducing or eliminating dividend payments, deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating discretionary uses of cash.\nA decline in economic conditions and lack of availability of business and consumer credit could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Any capital and credit market disruption could cause broader economic downturns, which may lead to reduced demand for our products and increased incidence of customers\u2019 inability to pay their accounts. Further, bankruptcies or similar events by customers may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced. Also, our suppliers may be negatively impacted by deteriorating economic conditions, causing disruption or delay of product availability. These events would adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Additionally, if the conditions of the capital and credit markets adversely affect the financial institutions that have committed to extended credit to us, they may be unable to fund borrowings under such commitments, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, liquidity and our ability to borrow funds, if needed, for working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes.\nInternational Political Risk\nOur international sales and operations are subject to various risks associated with changes in local laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs, trade restrictions and trade agreements, investments, taxation, capital controls, employment regulations, different liability standards and limitations on the repatriation of funds due to foreign currency controls. Our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as political and economic instability. Unfavorable changes in any of the foregoing could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nGoodwill and Intangibles\nAt December 31, 2014, goodwill and intangibles represented approximately 32% of our total assets. The recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is evaluated at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of our reporting unit and contains uncertainty because management must use judgment in determining appropriate assumptions to be used in the measurement of fair value. The estimates of fair value of our reporting unit and indefinite lived intangibles are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment and incorporates management\u2019s assumptions about expected future cash flows and contemplates other valuation techniques. Future cash flows can be affected by changes in the industry, a declining economic environment or market conditions. We cannot assure you that we will not suffer material impairments to goodwill in the future.\nRisks Related to Insurance Coverage\nWe carry general liability, comprehensive property damage, workers\u2019 compensation, health benefits and other insurance coverage that management considers adequate for the protection of its assets and operations. There can be no assurance, however, that the coverage limits of such policies will be adequate to cover losses and expenses for lawsuits brought or which may be brought against us. A loss in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and/or profitability. Certain self-insurance risks for casualty insurance programs and health benefits are retained and reserves are established based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported. Assurance cannot be provided that actual claims will not exceed present estimates. Exposure to catastrophic losses has been limited by maintaining excess and aggregate liability coverage and implementing stop-loss control programs.\nControl by Existing Shareholder\nAs of December 31, 2014, Albert H. Nahmad, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, a limited partnership and various trusts controlled by him, collectively had beneficial ownership of approximately 53% of the combined voting power of our outstanding Common and Class B common stock. Based on Mr. Nahmad\u2019s stock ownership and the stock ownership of the limited partnership and various trusts controlled by him, Mr. Nahmad has the voting power to elect all but three members of our nine-person Board of Directors and to control most corporate actions requiring shareholder approval.", "PERMNO": 66376, "SIC": 5070, "TIC": "WSO"}
