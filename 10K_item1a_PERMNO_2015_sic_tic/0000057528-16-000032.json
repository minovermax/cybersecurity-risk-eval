{"cik": "57528", "company": "SNYDER'S-LANCE, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties, including risks that we do not presently know of or currently deem insignificant, may also impair our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks related to our business\nOur performance may be impacted by general economic conditions or an economic downturn.\nAn overall decline in U.S. economic activity could adversely impact our business and financial results. Economic uncertainty may reduce consumer spending as consumers make decisions on what to include in their food budgets. This could also result in a shift in consumer preference toward private label products. Shifts in consumer spending could result in increased pressure from competitors or customers to increase promotional spending or reduce the prices of some of our products and/or limit our ability to increase or maintain prices, which could lower our revenue and profitability.\nInstability in financial markets may impact our ability or increase the cost to enter into new credit agreements in the future. Additionally, it may weaken the ability of our customers, suppliers, IBOs, third-party distributors, banks, insurance companies and other business partners to perform in the normal course of business, which could expose us to losses or disrupt the supply of inputs we rely upon to conduct our business. If one or more of our key business partners fail to perform as expected or contracted for any reason, our business could be negatively impacted.\nVolatility in the price or availability of the inputs we depend on, including raw materials, packaging, energy and labor, could adversely impact our financial results.\nOur financial results could be adversely impacted by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and packaging. While we often obtain substantial commitments for future delivery of certain raw materials, continued long-term increases in the costs of raw materials and packaging, including but not limited to cost increases due to the tightening of supply, could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur transportation and logistics system is dependent upon gasoline and diesel fuel, and our manufacturing operations depend on natural gas. While we may enter into forward purchase contracts to reduce the volatility associated with some of these costs, continued long-term changes in the cost or availability of these energy sources could adversely impact our financial results.\nOur continued growth requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled workforce and talented management team. Our financial results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs.\nWe operate in the highly competitive food industry.\nPrice competition and industry consolidation could adversely impact our financial results. The sales of most of our products are subject to significant competition primarily through promotional discounting and other price cutting techniques by competitors, some of whom are significantly larger than we are and have significantly greater resources than we do. In addition, there is continuing consolidation in the snack food industry and in retail outlets for snack foods, either of which could increase competition. Significant competition increases the possibility that we could lose one or more major customers, lose existing product authorizations at customer locations, lose market share and/or shelf space, increase expenditures or reduce selling prices, which could have an adverse impact on our business or financial results.\nPrice increases for our products that we initiate may negatively impact our financial results if not properly implemented or accepted by our customers. Future price increases, such as those made in order to offset increased input costs, may reduce our overall sales volume, which could reduce our revenue and operating profit. We may be unable to implement price increases driven by higher input costs on a timely basis or at all, either of which may reduce our operating profit. Additionally, if market prices for certain inputs decline significantly below the prices we are required by contract to pay, customer pressure to reduce the prices for our products could lower our revenue and operating profit.\nChanges in our top retail customer relationships could impact our revenue and profitability.\nWe are exposed to risks resulting from several large retail customers that account for a significant portion of our revenue. Our top ten retail customers accounted for approximately 50% of our net revenue during 2015, excluding sales of our products made by third-party distributors who are outside of our DSD network, with our largest retail customer, Wal-Mart, representing approximately 13% of our 2015 net revenue. The loss of one or more of our large retail customers could adversely affect our financial results. These customers typically make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, service, product quality, product offerings, consumer demand, as well as distribution capabilities and generally do not enter into long-term contracts. In addition, these significant retail customers may change their business practices related to inventories, product displays, logistics or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if revenue from one or more of these customers is significantly reduced or if the cost of complying with customers\u2019 demands is significant. If receivables from one or more of these customers become uncollectible, our financial results may be adversely impacted.\nWe may be unable to maintain our profitability in the face of a consolidating retail environment.\nOur largest customer, Wal-Mart, accounted for 13% of our fiscal 2015 net sales, and our ten largest customers together accounted for approximately 50% of our fiscal 2015 net sales. As the retail grocery industry continues to consolidate and our retail customers grow larger and become more sophisticated, our retail customers may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs. Further, these customers are reducing their inventories and increasing their emphasis on products that hold either the number one or number two market position and private label products. If we fail to use our sales and marketing expertise to maintain our category leadership positions to respond to these trends, or if we lower our prices or increase promotional support of our products and are unable to increase the volume of our products sold, our profitability and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nDemand for our products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences and tastes or if we are unable to innovate or market our products effectively.\nWe are a consumer products company operating in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products. To generate revenue and profits, we must sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers. Any significant changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products and erosion of our competitive and financial position. Our success depends on the ability to respond to consumer trends, including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, product attributes and ingredients. In addition, changes in product category consumption or consumer demographics could result in reduced demand for our products. Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including the aging of the general population, changes in social trends, or changes in travel, vacation or leisure activity patterns. Any of these changes may reduce consumers\u2019 willingness to purchase our products and negatively impact our financial results.\nOur continued success also is dependent on product innovation, including maintaining a robust pipeline of new products, and the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, marketing programs and product packaging. Although we devote significant resources to meet this goal, there can be no assurance as to the continued ability to develop and launch successful new products or variants of existing products, or to effectively execute advertising campaigns and marketing programs.\nOur results may be adversely affected by the failure to execute acquisitions and divestitures successfully.\nOur ability to meet our objectives with respect to the acquisition of new businesses or the divestiture of existing businesses may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers and sellers, negotiate favorable financial terms and other contractual terms, and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. Potential risks of acquisitions also include the inability to integrate acquired businesses efficiently into our existing operations; diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; potential loss of key employees and/or customers of acquired businesses; potential assumption of unknown liabilities; the inability to implement promptly an effective control environment; potential impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline; and the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which we have limited or no prior experience. Acquisitions outside the U.S. may present unique challenges and increase our exposure to risks associated with foreign operations, including foreign currency risks and risks associated with local regulatory agencies.\nPotential risks for divestitures include the inability to separate divested businesses or business units from the Company effectively and efficiently and to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs. Our inability to generate revenue and earnings to replace those previously generated by Private Brands or to generate cost reductions to offset overhead costs previously absorbed by Private Brands could negatively impact future results from continuing operations. Our business or financial results may be negatively affected if acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed.\nThe loss of key personnel could have an adverse effect on our financial results and growth prospects.\nThere are risks associated with our ability to retain key employees. If certain key employees terminate their employment, it could negatively impact manufacturing, sales, marketing or development activities. In addition, we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for key employees or offer employment to potential replacements on acceptable terms.\nEfforts to execute and accomplish our strategy could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe utilize several operating strategies to increase revenue and improve operating performance. If we are unsuccessful due to unplanned events, our ability to manage change or unfavorable market conditions, our financial performance could be adversely affected. If we pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures, or joint ventures, we may incur significant costs and may not be able to consummate the transactions or obtain financing. Further, the success of our acquisitions will depend on many factors, such as our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates, negotiate satisfactory purchase terms, obtain loans at satisfactory rates to fund acquisitions and successfully integrate and manage the growth from acquisitions. Integrating the operations, financial reporting, disparate technologies and personnel of newly acquired companies involves risks. As a result, we may not be able to realize expected synergies or other anticipated benefits of acquisitions.\nFuture acquisitions also could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our financial results. In the event we enter into strategic transactions or relationships, our financial results may differ from expectations. We may not be able to achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of potential acquisitions or divestitures.\nConcerns with the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients could cause consumers to avoid our products.\nWe could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain products or ingredients. Negative publicity about these concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause disruptions in production or distribution of our products and negatively impact our business and financial results.\nIf our products become adulterated, misbranded or mislabeled, we might need to recall those items and we may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured or become sick.\nWe may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled, and may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury to consumers. A widespread recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of the affected product for a period of time. A significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety and/or quality of our products, ingredients or packaging. Such a loss of confidence could occur even in the absence of a recall or a major product liability claim. We also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products causes injury or illness. A product recall or an adverse result in any such litigation could have an adverse effect on our operating and financial results. We may also lose customer confidence for our entire Branded portfolio as a result of any such recall or proceeding.\nDisruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nOur ability to manufacture and sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, due to factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, fire, pandemics or other events. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, may adversely affect our business or financial results, particularly in circumstances where a product or ingredient is sourced from a single supplier or location.\nWe may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in, or security breaches of, our information technology systems.\nWe increasingly rely on information technology systems to conduct our business. These systems can enhance efficiency and business processes but also present risks of unauthorized access to our networks or data centers. If unauthorized parties gain access to our systems, they could obtain and exploit confidential business, customer, or employee information and harm our competitive position. Further, these information systems may experience damage, failures, interruptions, errors, inefficiencies, attacks or suffer from fires or natural disasters, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results if not adequately mitigated by our security measures and disaster recovery plans.\nFurthermore, with multiple information technology systems as a result of acquisitions, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating data. In addition, we are currently in the process of consolidating systems which could provide additional security or business disruption risks which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nImproper use or misuse of social media may have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nConsumers are moving away from traditional means of electronic mail towards new forms of electronic communication, including social media. We support new ways of sharing data and communicating with customers using methods such as social networking. However, misuse of social networking by individuals, customers, competitors, or employees may result in unfavorable media attention which could negatively affect our business. Further, our competitors are increasingly using social media networks to market and advertise products. If we are unable to compete in this environment it could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur DSD network relies on a significant number of IBOs, and such reliance could affect our ability to efficiently and profitably distribute and market products, maintain existing markets and expand business into other geographic markets.\nOur DSD network relies on approximately 2,800 IBOs for the sale and distribution of Branded and Partner brand products.\nIBOs must make a commitment of capital and/or obtain financing to purchase a route business and other equipment to conduct their business. Certain financing arrangements, through third-party lending institutions, are made available to IBOs and require us to repurchase a route business if the IBO defaults on their loan and we then are required to collect any shortfall from the IBO to the extent possible. The inability of IBOs, in the aggregate, to make timely payments could require write-offs of accounts receivable or increased provisions made against accounts receivable, either of which could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe ability to maintain a DSD network depends on a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Some of these factors include: (i) the level of demand for the brands and products which are available in a particular distribution area; (ii) the ability to price products at levels competitive with those offered by competing producers; and (iii) the ability to deliver products in the quantity and at the time ordered by IBOs and retail customers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate the risks related to all or any of these factors in any of the current or prospective geographic areas of distribution. To the extent that any of these factors have an adverse effect on the relationships with IBOs, thus limiting maintenance and expansion of the sales market, our revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted.\nIdentifying new IBOs can be time-consuming and any resulting delay may be disruptive and costly to the business. There also is no assurance that we will be able to maintain current distribution relationships or establish and maintain successful relationships with IBOs in new geographic distribution areas. There is the possibility that we will have to incur significant expenses to attract and maintain IBOs in one or more geographic distribution areas. The occurrence of any of these factors could result in increased expense or a significant decrease in sales volume through our DSD network and harm our business and financial results.\nContinued success depends on the protection of our trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property rights.\nWe maintain numerous trademarks and other intellectual property rights, which are important to our success and competitive position, and the loss of or our inability to enforce trademark and other proprietary intellectual property rights could harm our business. We devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis. Efforts to establish and protect trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products. In addition, the laws and enforcement mechanisms of some foreign countries may not allow for the protection of proprietary rights to the same extent as in the United States and other countries.\nImpairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nThe net carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities, and the net carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks, customer relationships, route intangibles and other acquired intangibles. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or at any time when events occur, which could impact the value of our reporting unit or our indefinite-lived intangibles. These values depend on a variety of factors, including the success of our business, market conditions, earnings growth and expected cash flows. Impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by factors outside our control, such as increasing competitive pricing pressures, changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital or lower than expected sales and profit growth rates. In addition, if we see the need to consolidate certain brands, we could experience impairment of our trademark intangible assets. Significant and unanticipated changes could require a non-cash charge for impairment in a future period which may significantly affect our financial results in the period of such charge.\nNew regulations or legislation could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nFood production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal, state and other governmental agencies. New or increased government regulation of the food industry, including but not limited to areas related to food safety, chemical composition, production processes, traceability, product quality, packaging, labeling, school lunch guidelines, promotions, marketing and advertising (particularly such communications that are directed toward children), product recalls, records, storage and distribution could adversely impact our results of operations by increasing production costs or restricting our methods of operation and distribution. These regulations may address food industry or society factors, such as obesity, nutritional and environmental concerns and diet trends.\nWe are exposed to interest rate volatility, which could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe are exposed to interest rate volatility since the interest rates associated with portions of our debt are variable. While we mitigate a portion of this volatility by entering into interest rate swap agreements, those agreements could lock our interest rates above the market rates.\nA significant portion of our outstanding shares of common stock is controlled by a few individuals, and their interests may conflict with those of other stockholders.\nAs of January 2, 2016, Patricia A. Warehime beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 17.3% of our outstanding common stock. Mrs. Warehime serves as one of our directors. After giving effect to the issuance of our shares to the stockholders of Diamond in connection with our acquisition of Diamond, it is expected that Mrs. Warehime will beneficially own approximately 12.8% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, Mrs. Warehime may be able to exercise significant influence over us and certain matters requiring approval of our stockholders, including the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This could limit the ability of our other stockholders to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of our company. In addition, Mrs. Warehime may have actual or potential interests that diverge from the interests of our other stockholders.\nRisk factors associated with the acquisition of Diamond\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings we expect to realize from our acquisition of Diamond, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nThe success of our acquisition of Diamond will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining Diamond\u2019s business with ours. Our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to many risks including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour ability to combine Diamond\u2019s business with ours;\n\u2022\nand whether our combined business will perform as expected.\nIf we are not able to combine Diamond\u2019s business with ours successfully within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected, we may not perform as expected and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nPrior to the acquisition, Snyder\u2019s-Lance and Diamond operated independently. There can be no assurances that the pre-acquisition businesses can be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the loss of customers, or in unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs or an integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, the following issues, among others, must be addressed in integrating Diamond\u2019s operations with ours in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition:\n\u2022\ncombining operations and corporate functions;\n\u2022\nintegrating technologies and information technology infrastructure;\n\u2022\nconsolidating the companies\u2019 administrative infrastructure;\n\u2022\nintegrating the product offerings available to customers;\n\u2022\nidentifying and eliminating redundant or underperforming functions and assets;\n\u2022\nharmonizing operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls and other policies, procedures and processes;\n\u2022\nmaintaining existing agreements with customers, suppliers, distributors, brokers and vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with existing and prospective customers, suppliers, distributors, brokers and vendors;\n\u2022\naddressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n\u2022\ncoordinating distribution and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nmanaging the movement of employee positions to different locations; and\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically dispersed organizations.\nIn addition, at times the attention of members of our management and resources may be focused on the integration of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt our ongoing business.\nWe may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of our acquisition of Diamond.\nUncertainty about the effect of the acquisition on our employees may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. In addition, pursuant to change-in-control provisions in their respective employment agreements with Diamond, key employees of Diamond are entitled to receive severance payments upon a constructive termination of employment. Key employees potentially could terminate their employment and collect severance following specified circumstances set forth in their employment or severance agreements, including changes in such key employees\u2019 duties, positions, compensation and benefits or primary office location. Such circumstances could occur in connection with the integration process and as a result of changes in roles and responsibilities. If key employees depart, the integration of the two companies may be more difficult and our business may be harmed. Furthermore, we may have to incur significant costs in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent relating to the businesses of Snyder\u2019s-Lance or Diamond prior to our acquisition of Diamond, and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may be adversely affected. In addition, there could be distractions for the workforce and management associated with activities of labor unions or integrating employees into our company.\nOur business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the ongoing integration process.\nParties with which we and Diamond did business prior to our acquisition of Diamond may experience uncertainty associated with the transaction, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us. These business relationships may be subject to disruption as customers, distributors, suppliers, brokers, vendors and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us. These disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects, including an adverse effect on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction and acquisition-related costs in connection with our acquisition of Diamond.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with our acquisition of Diamond and combining Diamond\u2019s operations with ours. The substantial majority of non-recurring expenses is comprised of transaction costs related to the acquisition. We also will incur costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two companies, should allow us to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our international expansion strategies.\nWe plan to drive additional growth and profitability through international distribution channels. Consumer demand, behavior, taste and purchasing trends may differ in international markets and, as a result, sales of our products may not be successful or meet expectations, or the margins on those sales may be less than currently anticipated. We may also face difficulties integrating foreign business operations with our current sourcing, distribution, information technology systems and other operations. Any of these challenges could hinder our success in new markets or new distribution channels. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete any planned international expansion or that any new business will be profitable or meet our expectations.\nRisks related to our substantial indebtedness\nWe have substantial debt, which could adversely affect our financial health, our ability to obtain financing in the future, react to changes in our business, and make payments on our debt.\nAs of January 2, 2016 we had an aggregate principal amount of $388 million of outstanding debt, which increased to approximately $1.4 billion of outstanding debt upon the closing of the acquisition of Diamond. Our substantial debt could have important consequences to holders of our common stock, including the following:\n\u2022\nOur ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired in the future\n\u2022\nA substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes\n\u2022\nWe are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because a substantial portion of our borrowings are at variable rates\n\u2022\nIt may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our lenders, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness\n\u2022\nWe may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions\n\u2022\nWe may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt or comparable debt at more favorable interest rates and they, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns\n\u2022\nOur ability to refinance indebtedness may be limited or the associated costs may increase\n\u2022\nOur flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and ability to withstand competitive pressures could be limited, or we may be prevented from carrying out capital spending that is necessary or important to our growth strategy and efforts to improve operating margins or our business\nThe agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business.\nOur credit facilities contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to do the following:\n\u2022\nDispose of assets\n\u2022\nIncur additional indebtedness (including guarantees of additional indebtedness)\n\u2022\nPay dividends and make certain payments\n\u2022\nCreate liens on assets\n\u2022\nMake investments (including joint ventures)\n\u2022\nEngage in mergers, consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of our assets\n\u2022\nEngage in certain transactions with affiliates\n\u2022\nChange the business conducted by us\n\u2022\nAmend specific debt agreements\nOur ability to comply with these provisions in future periods will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which in turn will be subject to economic conditions and to financial, market and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our ability to comply with these provisions in future periods will also depend substantially on the pricing of our products, our success at implementing cost reduction initiatives and our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy.\nThe restrictions under the terms of our credit facilities may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business, and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our credit facilities may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under our credit facilities that would permit the applicable lenders or note holders, as the case may be, to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. In any such case, we may be unable to borrow under and may not be able to repay the amounts due under our credit facilities. This could have serious consequences to our financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent.\nOur ability to generate the significant amount of cash needed to pay interest and principal on our debt facilities and our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance our obligations under our debt will depend on our financial and operating performance. This, in turn, will be subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to the financial and business factors, many of which may be beyond our control, as described under \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business\u201d above.\nIf our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek to obtain additional equity capital or restructure our debt. In the future, our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on and principal of our debt, and such alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nWe cannot be assured that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, particularly because of our anticipated high levels of debt and the debt incurrence restrictions imposed by the agreements governing our debt, as well as prevailing market conditions. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. Our credit facilities restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such dispositions. As a result, we cannot assure you we will be able to consummate those sales, or if we do, what the timing of the sales will be, or whether the proceeds that we realize will be adequate to meet the debt service obligations when due.", "PERMNO": 48531, "SIC": 2052, "TIC": "LNCE"}
