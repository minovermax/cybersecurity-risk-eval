RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in the Company\u2019s common stock involves risks, including the possibility that the value of the investment could fall substantially and that dividends or other distributions could be reduced or eliminated. Investors should carefully consider the following risk factors before making an investment decision regarding the Company\u2019s stock. The risk factors may cause the Company\u2019s future earnings to be lower or its financial condition to be less favorable than expected, which could adversely affect the value of, and return on, an investment in the Company. In addition, other risks that the Company is not aware of, or which are not believed to be material, may cause earnings to be lower, or may deteriorate the financial condition of the Company. Consideration should also be given to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in the documents incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to limit its spread could adversely our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted economic and commercial activity and financial markets, both globally and within the United States. Measures to contain the virus, such as stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, closure of non-essential businesses, occupancy limitations and social distancing requirements, resulted in significant business and operational disruptions, including business closures, and mass layoffs and furloughs. Though most restrictions have generally been lifted or eased and consumer and business spending and unemployment levels have improved significantly, the economic recovery has been uneven, with industries such as travel, entertainment, hospitality and food service lagging, and, as of December 31, 2021, many companies have not returned workers to their offices. Supply chain disruptions precipitated by the abrupt economic slowdown have contributed to increased costs, lost revenue, and inflationary pressures for many segments of the economy. Further, a significant number of workers left their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to wage inflation in many industries as businesses attempt to fill vacant positions.\nThe United States government has taken significant steps to attempt to mitigate the economic effects of the pandemic. Congress appropriated approximately $4.7 trillion of fiscal stimulus in response to the COVID-19 pandemic pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, the American Rescue Plan Act and other supplemental legislation. In March 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to between 0.0% and 0.25%, compared to the previous target of between 1.00% and 1.25%. The Federal Reserve also took several actions to support financial markets, enable banks to continue to lend through the pandemic, and support businesses of all sizes. Whether the economic stimulus will have a lasting positive effect or whether it will contribute to higher inflation or other economic ill effects is unknown.\nSeveral vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed and widely distributed in the United States. However, it is unknown how effective they will be long-term or whether variants of the virus will develop against which the vaccines are less effective.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will ultimately affect our business is unknown and will depend, among other things, on the duration of the pandemic, the actions undertaken by national, state and local governments and health officials to contain the virus or mitigate its effects, the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines that have been developed and the extent to which they are accepted by the public, the development of effective therapies, the permanence of operating conditions that developed during the pandemic, and how quickly and to what extent economic conditions improve and normal business and operating conditions resume. The longer the pandemic persists, the more pronounced the ultimate effects are likely to be.\nThe continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to contain the virus, including effects of economic stimulus, and the exhaustion or expiration of stimulus benefits, could:\n\u2022reduce the demand for loans and other financial services;\n\u2022result in increases in loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures;\n\u2022cause the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, to decline in value;\n\u2022reduce the availability and productivity of our employees;\n\u2022cause our vendors and counterparties to be unable to meet existing obligations to us;\n\u2022negatively impact the business and operations of third-party service providers that perform critical services for our business;\n\u2022cause the value of our securities portfolio to decline; and\n\u2022cause the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors to decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us.\nAny one or a combination of the above events could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Economy, Financial Markets, Interest Rates and Liquidity\nThe geographic concentration of the Company\u2019s operations makes the Company susceptible to downturns in local economic conditions.\nThe Company\u2019s lending operations are concentrated in central Maryland, Northern Virginia and Washington D.C. The Company\u2019s success depends in part upon economic conditions in these markets. Adverse changes in economic conditions in these markets could limit growth in loans and deposits, impair the Company\u2019s ability to collect amounts due on loans, increase problem loans and charge-offs and otherwise negatively affect the Company\u2019s performance and financial condition. Declines in real estate values could cause some of the Company\u2019s residential and commercial real estate loans to be inadequately collateralized, which would expose the Company to a greater risk of loss in the event that the recovery on amounts due on defaulted loans is resolved by selling the real estate collateral under duress or to expedite payment.\nChanges in interest rates may adversely affect earnings and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s net income depends to a great extent upon the level of net interest income. Changes in interest rates can increase or decrease net interest income and net income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income earned on loans, investments, and other interest-earning assets, and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is affected by changes in market interest rates, because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to market interest rate changes. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or re-price more quickly than interest-earning assets in a period, an increase in market rates of interest could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or re-price more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income.\nChanges in market interest rates are affected by many factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including inflation, unemployment, money supply, fiscal policies of the U.S. government, domestic and international events, and events in U.S. and other financial markets. The Company attempts to manage its risk from changes in market interest rates by adjusting the rates, maturity, re-pricing, and balances of the different types of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, but interest rate risk management techniques are not exact. As a result, a rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s net interest margin and results of operations. Changes in the market interest rates for types of products and services in various markets also may vary significantly from location to location and over time based upon competition and local or regional economic factors.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company\u2019s interest rate sensitivity simulation model projected that net interest income would increase by 2.16% if interest rates immediately rose by 100 basis points. The results of an interest rate sensitivity simulation model depend upon a number of assumptions regarding customer behavior, movement of interest rates and cash flows, any of which may prove to be inaccurate. For further discussion regarding the impact of interest rates movements on net interest income, refer to the Market Risk Management section of Management's Discussion and Analysis on page 63.\nChanges to and replacement of the LIBOR Benchmark Interest Rate may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company has certain loans, interest rate swap agreements, investment securities and debt obligations whose interest rate is indexed to the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR). In 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (the \"FCA\"), which is responsible for regulating LIBOR, announced that the publication of LIBOR is not guaranteed beyond 2021. In December 2020, the administrator of LIBOR announced its intention to (i) cease the publication of the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR after December 31, 2021, and (ii) cease the publication of all other tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (one, three, six and 12 month LIBOR) after June 30, 2023. The FCA has stated that is does not intend to persuade or compel banks to submit to LIBOR after such respective dates. Until such time, however, FCA panel banks have agreed to continue to support LIBOR. In October 2021, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a Joint Statement on Managing the LIBOR Transition. In that guidance, the agencies offered their regulatory expectations and outlined potential supervisory and enforcement consequences for banks that fail to adequately plan for and implement the transition away from LIBOR. The failure to properly transition away from LIBOR may result in increased supervisory scrutiny. The language in the Company\u2019s LIBOR-based contracts and financial instruments has developed over time and may have\nvarious events that trigger when a successor index to LIBOR would be selected. If a trigger is satisfied, contracts and financial instruments may give the Company or the calculation agent, as applicable, discretion over the selection of the substitute index for the calculation of interest rates. The implementation of a substitute index for the calculation of interest rates under the Company\u2019s loan agreements may result in disputes or litigation with counter-parties over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. Even when robust fallback language is included, there can be no assurance that the replacement rate plus any spread adjustment will be economically equivalent to LIBOR, which could result in a lower interest rate being paid to the Company on such assets. To mitigate the risks associated with the expected discontinuation of LIBOR, the Company implemented enhanced fallback language for LIBOR-linked commercial loans, adhered to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association 2020 Fallbacks Protocol for interest rate swap agreements, and has updated its systems to accommodate alternative reference rates, and began originating loans utilizing alternative reference rates at the end of 2021.\nThe Alternative Reference Rates Committee (a group of private-market participants convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, as the recommend alternative to LIBOR. The use of SOFR as a substitute for LIBOR is voluntary and may not be suitable for all market participants. SOFR is calculated based on overnight transactions under repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. SOFR is observed and backward looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). SOFR is therefore likely to be lower than LIBOR and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions. To approximate economic equivalence to LIBOR, SOFR can be compounded over a relevant term and a spread adjustment may be added. Market practices related to SOFR calculation conventions continue to develop and may vary. Inconsistent calculation conventions among financial products may expose us to increased basis risk and resulting costs.\nOther alternatives to LIBOR also exist. The American Financial Exchange (\u201cAFX\u201d) has also created the American Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cAmeribor\u201d) as another potential replacement for LIBOR. Ameribor is calculated daily as the volume-weighted average interest rate of the overnight unsecured loans on AFX. Because of the difference in how it is constructed, Ameribor may diverge significantly from LIBOR in a range of situations and market conditions. Credit sensitive rates may become unrepresentative or subject to manipulation to the extent that they are based on a low volume of underlying transactions and sensitive to market stress.\nThe Company is subject to liquidity risks.\nEffective liquidity management is essential for the operation of the Company\u2019s business. The Company requires sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals, payments on debt obligations as they come due and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and other unpredictable circumstances causing industry or general financial market stress. The Company\u2019s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance its activities on terms that are acceptable to the Company could be impaired by factors that affect the Company specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally. Core deposits and FHLB advances are the Company\u2019s primary source of funding. A significant decrease in core deposits, an inability to renew FHLB advances, an inability to obtain alternative funding to core deposits or FHLB advances, or a substantial, unexpected, or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s investment securities portfolio is subject to credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk.\nThe investment securities portfolio has risk factors beyond the Company\u2019s control that may significantly influence its fair value. These risk factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults of the issuers of the securities, lack of market pricing of the securities, and instability in the credit markets. Lack of market activity with respect to some securities has, in certain circumstances, required the Company to base its fair market valuation on unobservable inputs. Any changes in these risk factors, in current accounting principles or interpretations of these principles could impact the Company\u2019s assessment of fair value. Adjustments to the allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale investment securities would negatively affect the Company\u2019s earnings and regulatory capital ratios.\nCredit Risks\nThe Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover its actual credit losses, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit losses in an amount that is believed to be appropriate to provide for expected losses inherent in the portfolio. The Company has a proactive program to monitor credit quality and to identify loans that may become non-performing; however, at any time there could be loans in the portfolio that may result in losses, but that have not been identified as non-performing or potential problem credits. The Company may be unable to identify all deteriorating credits prior to them becoming non-performing assets, or to limit losses on those loans that are identified. As a result, future additions to the allowance may be necessary. Additionally, future additions to the allowance may be required based on changes in the forecasted economic conditions, changes in the loans comprising the portfolio and changes in the financial condition of borrowers, or as a result of assumptions used by management in determining the allowance. Additionally, banking regulators, as an integral part of their supervisory function, periodically review the adequacy of the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses. These regulatory agencies may require an increase in the provision for expected credit losses or to recognize further loan charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may be different from the Company\u2019s. Any increase in the allowance for credit losses could have a negative effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nThe Company may not be able to adequately measure and limit its credit risk, which could lead to unexpected losses.\nThe business of lending is inherently risky, including risks that the principal of or interest on any loan will not be repaid timely, or at all, or that the value of any collateral supporting the loan will be insufficient to cover the Company\u2019s outstanding exposure. These risks may be affected by the strength of the borrower\u2019s business sector and local, regional and national market and economic conditions. Many of the Company\u2019s loans are made to small- to medium-sized businesses that may be less able to withstand competitive, economic and financial pressures than larger borrowers. The Company\u2019s risk management practices, such as monitoring the concentration of loans within specific industries and credit approval practices, may not adequately reduce credit risk, and credit administration personnel, policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of the loan portfolio. A failure to effectively measure and limit the credit risk associated with the Company\u2019s loan portfolio could lead to unexpected losses and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf non-performing assets increase, earnings will be adversely impacted.\nNon-performing assets adversely affect net income in various ways. Interest income is not accrued on non-accrual loans or other real estate owned. The Company must record a reserve for expected credit losses, which is established through a current period charge in the form of a provision for expected credit losses, and from time to time must write-down the value of properties in the Company\u2019s other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values. Additionally, there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance related to other real estate owned. Further, the resolution of non-performing assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract them from more profitable activities. Finally, if the estimate for the recorded allowance for credit losses proves to be incorrect and the allowance is inadequate, the allowance will have to be increased and, as a result, the Company's earnings would be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s commercial real estate lending activities expose it to increased lending risks and related loan losses.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company\u2019s commercial real estate loan portfolio totaled $6.9 billion, or 69% of its total loan portfolio. Commercial real estate loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the properties and the income stream of the borrowers. These loans involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. To the extent that borrowers have more than one commercial real estate loan outstanding, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship could expose the Company to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to-four family residential real estate loan. Moreover, if loans that are collateralized by commercial real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has deteriorated significantly, then the Company may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that the Company anticipated at the time it originated the loan. A decline in the value of the collateral for a loan may require the Company to increase its allowance for credit losses, which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings and financial condition.\nImposition of limits by the bank regulators on commercial real estate lending activities could curtail the Company\u2019s growth and adversely affect its earnings.\nRegulatory guidance on concentrations in commercial real estate lending provides that a bank\u2019s commercial real estate lending exposure could receive increased supervisory scrutiny where total commercial investor real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, nonowner-occupied investor real estate, and construction and land loans, represent 300% or more of an institution\u2019s total risk-based capital, and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or\nmore during the preceding 36 months. At December 31, 2021, the Bank\u2019s total commercial investor real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, nonowner-occupied commercial real estate, and construction and land loans represented 380% of the Bank\u2019s total risk-based capital and the growth in the commercial real estate (\"CRE\") portfolio exceeded 67% over the preceding 36 months, significantly driven by the 2020 acquisition of Revere. Management has established a CRE lending framework to monitor specific exposures and limits by types within the CRE portfolio and takes appropriate actions, as necessary. If the Federal Reserve, the Bank\u2019s primary federal regulator, were to impose restrictions on the amount of commercial real estate loans the Bank can hold in its portfolio, the Company\u2019s earnings would be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s concentration of residential mortgage loans exposes it to increased lending risks.\nAt December 31, 2021, 11%, of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio was secured by one-to-four family real estate, a significant majority of which is located in central Maryland, Northern Virginia and Washington, D.C. One-to-four family residential mortgage lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. Declines in real estate values could cause some of the Company\u2019s residential mortgages to be inadequately collateralized, which would expose the Company to a greater risk of loss if it seeks to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral.\nThe Company may be subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgage loans.\nWhen mortgage loans are sold, it is customary to make representations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. Whole loan sale agreements require the repurchase or substitution of mortgage loans in the event the Company breaches any of these representations or warranties. In addition, there may be a requirement to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. The Company receives a limited number of repurchase and indemnity demands from purchasers as a result of borrower fraud and early payment default of the borrower on mortgage loans. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase materially, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAny delays in the Company\u2019s ability to foreclose on delinquent mortgage loans may negatively impact the Company\u2019s business.\nThe origination of mortgage loans occurs with the expectation that, if the borrower defaults, the ultimate loss would be mitigated by the value of the collateral that secures the mortgage loan. The ability to mitigate the losses on defaulted loans depends upon the ability to promptly foreclose upon the collateral after an appropriate cure period. The length of the foreclosure process depends on state law and other factors, such as the volume of foreclosures and actions taken by the borrower to stop the foreclosure. Any delay in the foreclosure process will adversely affect the Company by increasing the expenses related to carrying such assets, such as taxes, insurance, and other carrying costs, and exposes the Company to losses as a result of potential additional declines in the value of such collateral.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Trust and Wealth Management Business\nThe Company\u2019s trust and wealth management fees may decrease as a result of poor investment performance, in either relative or absolute terms, which could decrease the Company\u2019s revenues and net earnings.\nThe Company\u2019s trust and wealth management businesses derive a significant amount of their revenues from investment management fees based on assets under management. The Company\u2019s ability to maintain or increase assets under management is subject to a number of factors, including investors\u2019 perception of the Company\u2019s past performance, in either relative or absolute terms, general market and economic conditions, and competition from other investment management firms. A decline in the fair value of the assets under management would decrease the Company\u2019s trust and wealth management fee income.\nInvestment performance is one of the most important factors in retaining existing clients and competing for new trust and wealth management clients. Poor investment performance could reduce the Company\u2019s revenues and impede the growth of the Company\u2019s trust and wealth management business in the following ways: existing clients may withdraw funds from the Company\u2019s trust and wealth management business in favor of better performing products or firms; asset-based management fees could decline from a decrease in assets under management; the Company\u2019s ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish; and the Company\u2019s portfolio managers may depart, to join a competitor or otherwise.\nEven when market conditions are generally favorable, the Company\u2019s investment performance may be adversely affected by the investment style of its portfolio managers and the particular investments that they make or recommend. To the extent that the Company\u2019s future investment performance is perceived to be poor in either relative or absolute terms, the revenues and profitability of\nthe Company\u2019s trust and wealth management business will likely be reduced and the Company\u2019s ability to attract new clients will likely be impaired.\nThe Company\u2019s investment management contracts are terminable without cause and on relatively short notice by the Company\u2019s clients, which makes the Company vulnerable to short-term declines in the performance of the securities under the Company\u2019s management.\nLike most wealth management businesses, the investment advisory contracts the Company maintains with its clients are typically terminable by the client without cause upon less than 30 days\u2019 notice. As a result, even short-term declines in the performance of the accounts that the Company manages, which can result from factors outside the Company\u2019s control, such as adverse changes in general market or economic conditions or the poor performance of some of the investments the Company has recommended to its clients, could lead some of the Company\u2019s clients to move assets under the Company\u2019s management to other investment advisors that have investment product offerings or investment strategies different than the Company\u2019s. A decline in assets under management, and a corresponding decline in investment management fees, would adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe wealth management business is heavily regulated, and the regulators have the ability to limit or restrict the Company\u2019s activities and impose fines or suspensions on the conduct of the Company\u2019s business.\nThe wealth management business is highly regulated, primarily at the federal level. The failure of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries that are registered investment advisors to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, suspensions of individual employees or other sanctions including revocation of such subsidiaries\u2019 registration as an investment adviser. Changes in the laws or regulations governing the Company\u2019s wealth management business could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStrategic and Other Risks\nCombining acquired businesses may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of acquisitions may not be realized.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s mergers and acquisitions, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to successfully combine and integrate the acquired business in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt existing customer relations nor result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of either company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors, employees and other constituents or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction. The loss of key employees could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to successfully conduct its business, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results and the value of its common stock. If the Company experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of a transaction may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause the Company to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from the Company and move their business to competing financial institutions. Integration efforts will also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the Company during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of a transaction. It is possible that the potential cost savings could turn out to be more difficult to achieve than anticipated. The cost savings estimates also depend on the ability to combine the businesses in a manner that permits those cost savings to be realized.\nThe Company depends on its executive officers and key personnel to continue the implementation of its long-term business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nThe Company believes that its continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of its management team , as well as on its ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified senior and middle management and other skilled employees. The loss of service of one or more of the Company\u2019s executive officers or key personnel could reduce the Company\u2019s ability to successfully implement its long-term business strategy, its business could suffer and the value of the Company\u2019s common stock could be materially adversely affected. Leadership changes will occur from time to time and the Company cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur or whether the Company will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. The Company believes its management team possesses valuable knowledge about the banking industry and the Company\u2019s markets and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replicate. Although the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and certain other executive officers have entered into employment agreements with the Company, it is possible that they may not complete the term of their employment agreements or renew them upon expiration. The Company\u2019s success also depends on the experience of its branch\nmanagers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve. The loss of these key personnel could negatively affect the Company\u2019s banking operations. Competition for qualified employees is intense, and the process of locating key personnel with the combination of skills, attributes and business relationships required to execute the Company\u2019s business plan may be lengthy. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRestrictions on unfriendly acquisitions could prevent a takeover of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage takeover attempts that are not approved by the Company\u2019s board of directors. The Maryland General Corporation Law also includes provisions that make an acquisition of the Company more difficult. These provisions include super-majority provisions for the approval of certain business combinations and certain provisions relating to meetings of shareholders. The Company\u2019s articles of incorporation also authorize the issuance of additional shares by the board of directors without shareholder approval on terms or in circumstances that could deter a future takeover attempt. These provisions may prevent a future takeover attempt in which the shareholders otherwise might receive a substantial premium for their shares over then-current market prices.\nMarket competition may decrease the Company\u2019s growth or profits.\nThe Company competes for loans, deposits, and investment dollars with other banks and other financial institutions and enterprises, such as securities firms, insurance companies, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage brokers, and private lenders, many of which have substantially greater resources than possessed by the Company. Credit unions have federal tax exemptions, which may allow them to offer lower rates on loans and higher rates on deposits than taxpaying financial institutions such as commercial banks. In addition, non-depository institution competitors are generally not subject to the extensive regulation applicable to institutions that offer federally insured deposits. Other institutions may have other competitive advantages in particular markets or may be willing to accept lower profit margins on certain products. These differences in resources, regulation, competitive advantages, and business strategy create a competitive landscape that may decrease the Company\u2019s net interest margin, increase the Company\u2019s operating costs, and may make it harder to compete profitably.\nOperational Risks\nThe high volume of transactions processed by the Company exposes the Company to significant operational risks.\nThe Company relies on the ability of its employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from the Company\u2019s operations, including, but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or outside persons, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the Company\u2019s internal control system and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulations, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. A breakdown in the Company\u2019s internal control system, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions could result in material financial loss, the imposition of regulatory action, and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation.\nFailure to keep up with technological change in the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s competitive position or profitability.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Company\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Company\u2019s operations. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological changes affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks and/or losses to the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which the Company is subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, interest rate, operational and\ncompliance. The Company\u2019s framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. The Company\u2019s risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances and may not adequately mitigate any risk or loss to the Company. If the Company\u2019s risk management framework is not effective, the Company could suffer unexpected losses and the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The Company may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences.\nThe Company\u2019s information systems may experience an interruption or security breach.\nThe Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. The Company, its customers, and other financial institutions with which the Company interacts, are subject to ongoing, continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers, organized criminals, and in some cases, state-sponsored organizations. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the Company\u2019s customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems, misappropriation of funds, and theft of proprietary Company or customer data. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure, interruption or security breach of the Company\u2019s information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of the Company\u2019s information systems could damage its reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny, require the Company to incur additional expense, or expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise the Company\u2019s information and expose the Company to liability, which would cause its business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of the Company\u2019s business, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, its proprietary business information and that of the Company\u2019s customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees, in the Company\u2019s third-party data centers and on its networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to the Company\u2019s operations and business strategy. Despite the security measures the Company has implemented to help ensure data security and compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, which include firewalls, regular penetration testing and other measures, the Company\u2019s facilities and systems, and those of the Company\u2019s third-party service providers and vendors, may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, security breaches, ransomware, unauthorized activity and access, malicious code, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, theft of data, misplaced or lost data, fraud, misconduct or misuse, social engineering attacks and denial of service attacks, phishing attacks, programming or human errors, physical break-ins, or other disruptions, any of which could result in the loss or disclosure of confidential or personal client or employee information or the Company\u2019s own proprietary information. Any such loss or disclosure of confidential information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and the services it provides to customers, damage its reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in its products and services, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, revenues and competitive position.\nThe Company is subject to laws regarding the privacy, information security and protection of personal information and any violation of these laws or another incident involving personal, confidential or proprietary information of individuals could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and earnings. The Company\u2019s business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including personally identifiable information in various information systems that the Company maintains and in those maintained by third parties with whom the Company contracts to provide data services. The Company also maintains important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about its employees and information relating to its operations. The Company is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals (including customers, employees, suppliers and other third parties). For example, the Company\u2019s business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to share nonpublic personal information about its customers with non-affiliated third parties; (ii) requires that the Company provide certain disclosures to customers about its information collection, sharing and security practices and afford customers the right to \u201copt out\u201d of any information sharing by the Company with non-affiliated third parties (with certain exceptions); and (iii) requires that the Company develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing appropriate safeguards based on the Company\u2019s size and complexity, the nature and scope of its activities, and the sensitivity of customer information it processes, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Various state and federal laws and regulations impose data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Ensuring that the Company\u2019s collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations can increase costs.\nFurthermore, the Company may not be able to ensure that all of its clients, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information that they exchange with the Company, particularly where such information is transmitted by electronic means. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or others were to be mishandled or misused (in situations where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties), the Company could be exposed to litigation or regulatory sanctions under personal information laws and regulations. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that such measures are inadequate, could cause the Company to lose customers or potential customers for its products and services and thereby reduce its revenues. Accordingly, any failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject the Company to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices or in significant liabilities, fines or penalties, and could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and earnings.\nThe reliance of the Company on third-party vendors could expose it to additional cyber risk and liability.\nThe operation of the Company\u2019s business involves outsourcing of certain business functions and reliance on third-party providers, which may result in transmission and maintenance of personal, confidential, and proprietary information to and by such vendors. Although the Company requires third-party providers to maintain certain levels of information security, such providers remain vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious attacks that could ultimately compromise sensitive information possessed by the Company. Although the Company contracts to limit its liability in connection with attacks against third-party providers, the Company remains exposed to risk of loss associated with such vendors.\nThe Company outsources certain aspects of its data processing to certain third-party providers, which may expose it to additional risk.\nThe Company outsources certain key aspects of the Company\u2019s data processing to certain third-party providers. While the Company has selected these third-party providers carefully, it cannot control their actions. If the Company\u2019s third-party providers encounter difficulties, including those that result from their failure to provide services for any reason or their poor performance of services, or if the Company has difficulty in communicating with them, its ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions could be affected, and the Company\u2019s business operations could be adversely impacted. Replacing these third-party providers could also entail significant delay and expense.\nThe Company\u2019s third-party providers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security breaches. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other third-party providers and their personnel. The Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by such security breaches or viruses. To the extent that the activities of the Company\u2019s third-party providers or the activities of the Company\u2019s customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose the Company to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities.\nThe Company is dependent on its information technology and telecommunications systems; third-party service providers and systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of its information technology and telecommunications systems third-party service providers. The Company outsources many of its major systems, such as data processing and deposit processing systems. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt the Company\u2019s operations. Because the Company\u2019s information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, it could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of the Company\u2019s ability to provide customer service, compromise its ability to operate effectively, damage the Company\u2019s reputation, result in a loss of customer business and/or subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Company provides its customers the ability to bank remotely, including online over the internet. The secure transmission of confidential information is a critical element of remote banking. The Company\u2019s network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes, spam attacks, human error, natural disasters, power loss and other security breaches. The Company may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. Further, the Company outsources some of the data processing functions used for remote banking, and accordingly it is dependent on the expertise and performance of its third-party providers. To the extent that the Company\u2019s activities, the activities of its customers, or the activities of the Company\u2019s third-party service providers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose the Company to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in the Company\u2019s systems and could adversely affect its reputation, results of operations and ability to attract and maintain customers and businesses. In addition, a security breach could also subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny, expose it to civil litigation and possible financial liability and cause reputational damage.\nThe adoption of flexible work from home arrangements poses a number of operational risks that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the Company transitioned to a remote working environment, with a peak of 85% of employees working remotely. While the Company has since brought employees back to the office, it has adopted more flexible work arrangements that permit some employees to work from home full or part time. Having employees conduct their daily work in the Company\u2019s offices helps to ensure a level of productivity and operational security that may not be achieved when working remotely for an extended period. Remote work arrangements could strain the Company\u2019s technology resources and introduce operational risks, including heightened cybersecurity risk, as remote working environments can be less secure. Over time, remote work arrangements may decrease the ability to maintain the Company\u2019s culture, which is integral to the Company\u2019s success. Additionally, a remote working environment may impede the Company\u2019s ability to undertake new business projects and foster a creative environment. As remote work arrangements become more flexible and commonplace, the Company\u2019s ability to compete for qualified employees could be challenged. The prevalence of remote work arrangements will expand competition among employers and may put the Company at a disadvantage if it is unable or unwilling to offer the same level of flexibility. Failure to attract and retain the desired workforce could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Financial Statements\nChanges in accounting standards or interpretation of new or existing standards may affect how the Company reports its financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) and the SEC change accounting regulations and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements. In addition, the FASB, SEC, bank regulators and the outside independent auditors may revise their previous interpretations regarding existing accounting regulations and the application of these accounting standards. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how to record and report the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, there could be a requirement to apply a new or revised accounting standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements.\nThe Current Expected Credit Loss accounting standard could require the Company to increase its allowance for credit losses and may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nAccounting Standard Update (\"ASU\") No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments became effective for the Company on January 1, 2020. This standard requires earlier recognition of expected credit losses on loans and certain other instruments, compared to the previously applied incurred loss model. CECL requires advanced modeling techniques, heavy reliance on assumptions, and dependence on historical data that may not accurately forecast losses. CECL can result in greater volatility in the level of the allowance for credit losses, depending on various factors and assumptions applied in the model, such as the forecasted economic conditions in the foreseeable future and loan payment behaviors. Any increase in the allowance for credit losses, or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses, can have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nImpairment in the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets could negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2021, goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $396.1 million. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. The estimated fair values of the acquired assets and\nassumed liabilities may be subject to refinement as additional information relative to closing date fair values becomes available and may result in adjustments to goodwill within the first 12 months following the closing date of the acquisition. Goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. A significant decline in expected future cash flows, a material change in interest rates, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or a significant or sustained decline in the price of the Company\u2019s common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. The amount of any impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models.\nThe processes that the Company uses to estimate its allowance for credit losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on its financial condition and results of operations, depend upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation. If the models that the Company uses for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, the Company may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If the models that the Company uses for determining its allowance for expected credit losses are inadequate, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs. If the models that the Company uses to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what the Company could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in the Company\u2019s analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory Risks\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated industry, and compliance with, or changes to, the laws and regulations that govern its operations may adversely affect the Company.\nThe banking industry is heavily regulated. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect the federal deposit insurance funds and depositors, not shareholders. Sandy Spring Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and by Maryland banking authorities. Sandy Spring Bancorp is subject to regulation and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Federal and state laws and regulations govern numerous matters affecting the Company and the Bank, including changes in the ownership or control of banks and bank holding companies, maintenance of adequate capital and sound financial condition, permissible types, amounts and terms of loans and investments, permissible non-banking activities, the level of reserves against deposits and restrictions on dividend payments. These and other restrictions limit the manner in which the Company may conduct business and obtain financing. The laws, rules, regulations, and supervisory guidance and policies applicable to the Company and the Bank are subject to regular modification and change. Such changes may, among other things, increase the cost of doing business, limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer, or affect the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations. The burdens imposed by federal and state regulations put banks at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors such as finance companies, mortgage banking companies, and leasing companies.\nThe Company will become subject to reduced interchange income in 2022.\nDebit card interchange fee restrictions set forth in Section 1075 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which is known as the Durbin Amendment, as implemented by regulations of the Federal Reserve, cap the maximum debit interchange fee that a debit card issuer may receive per transaction at the sum of $0.21 plus five basis points. A debit card issuer that adopts certain fraud prevention procedures may charge an additional $0.01 per transaction. Debit card issuers with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion are exempt from these interchange fee restrictions. The Company, which had total consolidated assets of greater than $10 billion at December 31, 2021, will become subject to the interchange restrictions of the Durbin Amendment beginning July 1, 2022. The reduction in interchange income could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends is limited by law.\nThe ability to pay dividends to shareholders largely depends on Sandy Spring Bancorp\u2019s receipt of dividends from Sandy Spring Bank. The amount of dividends that Sandy Spring Bank may pay to Sandy Spring Bancorp is limited by federal laws and regulations. The ability of Sandy Spring Bank to pay dividends is also subject to its profitability, financial condition and cash flow requirements. There is no assurance that Sandy Spring Bank will be able to pay dividends to Sandy Spring Bancorp in the future. In addition, as a bank holding company, the Company\u2019s ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on federal regulatory considerations, including limits on dividends should the Company not maintain the required capital conservation buffer and guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of earnings, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization\u2019s expected future needs, asset quality and financial condition. The Company may limit the payment of dividends, even when the legal ability to pay them exists, in order to retain earnings for other uses.\nFederal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of the Company\u2019s business, including compliance with laws and regulations; the failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which the Company is or becomes subject as a result of such examinations could adversely affect the Company.\nAs part of the bank regulatory process, the Federal Reserve and the Maryland banking authorities periodically conduct comprehensive examinations of the Company\u2019s business, including compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, either of these banking agencies were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, asset sensitivity, risk management or other aspects of any of the Company\u2019s operations had become unsatisfactory, or that the Company, the Bank or their respective management were in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. The Federal Reserve may enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices or violations of law, require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, direct an increase in the Company\u2019s capital levels, restrict the Company\u2019s growth, assess civil monetary penalties against the Company, the Bank or their respective officers or directors, and remove officers and directors. The FDIC also has authority to review the Bank\u2019s financial condition, and, if the FDIC were to conclude that the Bank or its directors were engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, that the Bank was in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or that the Bank or the directors violated applicable law, the FDIC could move to terminate the Bank\u2019s deposit insurance. If the Company becomes subject to such regulatory actions, its business, financial condition, earnings and reputation could be adversely affected.\nThe Company is subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act (\"CRA\") fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe CRA requires the Federal Reserve to assess the Bank\u2019s performance in meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. If the Federal Reserve determines that the Bank needs to improve its performance or is in substantial non-compliance with CRA requirements, various adverse regulatory consequences may ensue. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The CFPB, the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. The CFPB was created under the Dodd-Frank Act to centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection with broad rule-making authority to administer and carry out the purposes and objectives of federal consumer financial laws with respect to all financial institutions that offer financial products and services to consumers. The CFPB is also authorized to prescribe rules applicable to any covered person or service provider, identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are \u201cunfair, deceptive, or abusive\u201d in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. The ongoing broad rule-making powers of the CFPB have potential to have a significant impact on the operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services.\nA successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA, fair lending laws or regulations, or consumer lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company faces a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, PATRIOT Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank\nSecrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and engages in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. Federal and state bank regulators also focus on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If the Company\u2019s policies, procedures and systems are deemed to be deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that the Company may acquire in the future are deficient, the Company would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on its ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of its business plan, including its acquisition plans, which would negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for the Company.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nChanges in U.S. or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business activities and earnings are affected by general business conditions in the United States and in the Company\u2019s local market area. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, unemployment levels, consumer confidence and spending, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, and the strength of the economy in the United States generally and, in particular, the Company\u2019s market area. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment; natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors. Economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding continuing economic improvement may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and savings habits. Elevated levels of unemployment, declines in the values of real estate, extended federal government shutdowns, or other events that affect household and/or corporate incomes could impair the ability of the Company\u2019s borrowers to repay their loans in accordance with their terms and reduce demand for banking products and services.\nIncreasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks.\nCompanies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, health and safety, diversity, labor conditions and human rights. Increased ESG related compliance costs could result in increases to our overall operational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation, ability to do business with certain partners, and our stock price. New government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure. Additionally, concerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. The Company and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. The Company and its customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions, operating process changes, among other impacts. The impact on the Company\u2019s customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities. In addition, the Company could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans. The Company\u2019s efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions may not be effective in protecting the Company from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior.\nThe market price for the Company\u2019s stock may be volatile.\nThe market price for the Company\u2019s common stock has fluctuated, ranging between $33.23 and $51.62 per share during the 12 months ended December 31, 2021. The overall market and the price of the Company\u2019s common stock may experience volatility. There may be a significant impact on the market price for the common stock due to, among other things:\n\u2022past and future dividend practice;\n\u2022financial condition, performance, creditworthiness and prospects;\n\u2022quarterly variations in operating results or the quality of the Company\u2019s assets;\n\u2022operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022changes in expectations as to the future financial performance;\n\u2022announcements of innovations, new products, strategic developments, significant contracts, acquisitions and other material events by the Company or its competitors;\n\u2022the operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to the Company;\n\u2022future sales of the Company\u2019s equity or equity-related securities;\n\u2022the credit, mortgage and housing markets, the markets for securities relating to mortgages or housing, and developments with respect to financial institutions generally; and\n\u2022changes in global financial markets and economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity or real estate valuations or volatility or other geopolitical, regulatory or judicial events.\nThere can be no assurance that a more active or consistent trading market in the Company\u2019s common stock will develop. As a result, relatively small trades could have a significant impact on the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nFuture sales of the Company\u2019s common stock or other securities may dilute the value and adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nIn many situations, the Company\u2019s board of directors has the authority, without any vote of the Company\u2019s shareholders, to issue shares of authorized but unissued stock, including shares authorized and unissued under the Company\u2019s equity incentive plans. In the future, additional securities may be issued, through public or private offerings, in order to raise additional capital. Any such issuance would dilute the percentage of ownership interest of existing shareholders and may dilute the per share book value of the Company\u2019s common stock. In addition, option holders may exercise their options at a time when the Company would otherwise be able to obtain additional equity capital on more favorable terms.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations and differences in interpretation of tax laws and regulations may negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nFrom time to time, local, state or federal tax authorities change tax laws and regulations, which may result in a decrease or increase to our net deferred tax asset. Local, state or federal tax authorities may interpret laws and regulations differently than does the Company and challenge tax positions that the Company has taken on its tax returns. This may result in differences in the treatment of revenues, deductions, credits and/or differences in the timing of these items. The differences in treatment may result in payment of additional taxes, interest, penalties or litigation costs that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results.\nNegative public opinion regarding the Company or failure to maintain the Company\u2019s reputation in the communities it serves could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and prevent the Company from growing its business.\nThe Company\u2019s reputation within the communities it serves is critical to its success. The Company believes it has set itself apart from its competitors by building strong personal and professional relationships with its customers and being an active member of the communities it serves. As such, the Company strives to enhance its reputation by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share the Company\u2019s core values of being an integral part of the communities it serves and delivering superior service to its customers. If the Company\u2019s reputation is negatively affected by the actions of its employees or otherwise, the Company may be less successful in attracting new talent and customers or may lose existing customers, and its business, financial condition and earnings could be adversely affected. Further, negative public opinion can expose the Company to litigation and regulatory action and delay and impede the Company\u2019s efforts to implement its growth strategy, which could further adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 83414, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SASR"}
